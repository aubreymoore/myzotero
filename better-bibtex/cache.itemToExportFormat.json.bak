(HA), be checked to verify genomic changes have not occurred which adapt them to culture but reduce or cancel their ability to infect the target pest, the coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), Oryctes rhinoceros (L.). Full genomes of field-caught OrNV isolates, and their infectivity against larvae and adults, could be compared with those of HA-cultured isolates. Further data to correlate OrNV dosage indices with doses in number of virions/ml could be advantageous so as to explore if CRB larvae or adults may resist infection by a sub-threshold dose. Also the possibility of changes in the HA culture cells which alter the outer coat of the resulting virion, hence perhaps its infectivity towards CRB cells, could be checked. Might it be possible to move beyond HA-culture and develop tissue culture of Oryctes rhinoceros cells for mass production of OrNV as this beetle species is the target? Nuclear genomes of OrNV-resistant and OrNV-susceptible strains of the CRB could be examined for changes perhaps correlated with resistance. The possibility of endosymbiotic bacteria affecting CRB susceptibility to OrNV might be checked.","title":"Possibility of Evolution in Culture of the Oryctes Nudivirus of the Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle Oryctes rhinoceros (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Dynastinae)","creators":[{"firstName":"","lastName":"Geoffrey O.

One hypothesis to explain these fluctuations is that they are driven by pathogens with long-lived infectious stages capable of surviving outside the host. The basis of the argument is that, for realistic parameter values, a mathematical disease model incorporating such an infectious stage is likely to show cycles with the same period as is observed in nature. The mathematical model used to make this argument, however, is so simple that it may not be biologically meaningful. In this article, I extend the original model by including two realistic complications: density-dependent host reproduction and host movement behavior. Including density-dependent host reproduction greatly increases the likelihood of cycles; addi tional realism thus strengthens the original conclusion. Including host movement behavior makes the model more versatile, as it allows comparison of the model output with literature data on the spatial spread of insect viruses. This comparison suggests that the spatial spread of the viruses of Gilpinia hercyniae and Oryctes rhinoceros can be explained with a very simple model of host movement, without recourse to complicated mechanisms of dispersal. The introduction of host movement behavior also introduces the possibility of cycles of outbreaks in space and time simultaneously-that is, waves of disease that will reappear at regular intervals.","title":"DENSITY DEPENDENCE AND SPATIAL STRUCTURE IN THE DYNAMICS OF INSECT PATHOGENS","creators":[{"firstName":"","lastName":"GREG DWYER","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-10-19T01:05:27Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/2CEW8D9W","itemID":1915,"attachments":[{"key":"WZJ6KU4H","version":235,"itemType":"attachment","title":"GREG DWYER, 1994.pdf","parentItem":"2CEW8D9W","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"GREG DWYER, 1994.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-10-19T01:06:12Z","dateModified":"2018-10-19T01:06:12Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/WZJ6KU4H","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/WZJ6KU4H/GREG DWYER, 1994.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1927/GREG DWYER, 1994.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303734,"version":0},"$loki":6},{"itemID":2408,"item":{"key":"2E3G6SJR","version":734,"itemType":"report","url":"https://github.com/aubreymoore/rearing3/raw/master/bioassay-PNGperOS.pdf","date":"2019","extra":"Citation Key: moore_bioassay_2019-9","institution":"University of Guam","title":"Bioassay Report: PNGperOS","creators":[{"firstName":"Aubrey","lastName":"Moore","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James J.","lastName":"Grasela","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-28T20:46:03Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:25:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/2E3G6SJR","itemID":2408,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303735,"version":0},"$loki":7},{"itemID":1017,"item":{"key":"2EAQV26G","version":705,"itemType":"journalArticle","date":"2014","extra":"Citation Key: moore_visualization_2014","title":"Visualization of Trap Catch Data","creators":[{"firstName":"Aubrey","lastName":"Moore","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/2EAQV26G","itemID":1017,"attachments":[{"key":"NTFR2XMX","version":12,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Moore - 2014 - Visualization of Trap Catch Data","parentItem":"2EAQV26G","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Moore - 2014 - Visualization of Trap Catch Data.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/NTFR2XMX","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/NTFR2XMX/Moore - 2014 - Visualization of Trap Catch Data.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1249/Moore - 2014 - Visualization of Trap Catch Data.pdf"},{"key":"JB9XVAW4","version":12,"itemType":"attachment","title":"trapMaps_2","parentItem":"2EAQV26G","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"trapMaps_2.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/JB9XVAW4","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/JB9XVAW4/trapMaps_2.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1248/trapMaps_2.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303737,"version":0},"$loki":8},{"itemID":992,"item":{"key":"2FCB3IK9","version":702,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"12","pages":"227-238","publicationTitle":"Ecological Entomology","date":"1987","extra":"Citation Key: zelazny_ecological_1987","title":"Ecological methods for adult populations of Oryctes rhinoceros (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae)","creators":[{"firstName":"B.","lastName":"Zelazny","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"A.

Reduction of mean percent of infestation in 1985 and 1986 ranged 77-100% according to locality.","title":"Control of coconut rhinoceros beetle Oryctes Rhinoceros L.(Scarabidae: Coleoptera) in South Oman","creators":[{"firstName":"","lastName":"Kinawy, M.M.","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-11T02:55:44Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/2QWSNCWX","itemID":1987,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303743,"version":0},"$loki":14},{"itemID":1041,"item":{"key":"2TG6DKCB","version":707,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.guampdn.com/guampublishing/special-sections/ManLandSea/index.html","publicationTitle":"Pacific Daily News","date":"2009","extra":"Citation Key: moore_man_2009-2","title":"Man, Land and Sea: Guam's Rhino Hunters","creators":[{"firstName":"Aubrey","lastName":"Moore","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:56Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/2TG6DKCB","itemID":1041,"attachments":[],"notes":[{"key":"AUDTJAKF","version":3,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"2TG6DKCB","note":"<p>Evidence 42</p>","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/AUDTJAKF"}]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303744,"version":0},"$loki":15},{"itemID":1833,"item":{"key":"2TH4TWIR","version":721,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"1","issue":"1","pages":"38-40","publicationTitle":"Indian J.

When A. albopictus cells were inoculated with high concentrations of Oryctes baculovirus virus uptake and syncytia formation occurred but there was no evidence of virus replication and thus infection probably did not occur.

Until recently, however, it was not practicable to apply this powerful technique to low-altitude \"foraging\" flights (defined by Kennedy, 1985), i.e., flights to find food, mates, egg-laying\nsites, and other resource items (Bell, 1991). This is because the strong radar\nechoes from ground features and vegetation (\"clutter\") usually mask the very\ntiny returns from insects. In principle, this constraint can be overcome by using\nthe harmonic transponder technique first suggested in 1967 (Vogler et al., 1967) and subsequently investigated for automobile collision avoidance systems (Shefer et al., 1974). In this technique, the target to be tracked is \"tagged\" with an harmonic transponder, in the form of an electrically nonlinear conductor\n(usually a diode) attached to some form of antenna.

Due to similarities in pathology and morphology to members of the family Baculoviridae, they have been previously classified as the so-called “non-occluded” baculoviruses. However, presently they are taxonomically orphaned and are not assigned to any virus family because of the lack of genetic relatedness to Baculoviridae,. Here, we report on recent progress in the genomic analysis of Heliothis zea nudivirus 1 (HzNV-1), Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV), Gryllus bimaculatus nudivirus (GbNV) and Heliotis zea nudivirus 2 (HzNV-2). Gene content comparison and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the viruses share 15 core genes with baculoviruses and form a monophyletic sister group to them. Consequences of the genetic relationship are discussed for the classification of nudiviruses.","title":"Nudivirus Genomics: Diversity and Classification","creators":[{"firstName":"John P.

Two cloned PstI fragments, C and D, of OrV DNA have been sequenced, consisting of 19,805 and 17,146bp, respectively, and comprising about 30% of the OrV genome. For each of the two fragments, 20 open reading frames (ORFs) of 150 nucleotides or greater with no or minimal overlap were predicted. Ten of the predicted 40 ORFs revealed signiﬁcant similarities to Heliothis zea virus 1 (HzV-1) ORFs, of which ﬁve, lef-4, lef-5, pif-2, dnapol and ac81, are homologues of conserved core genes in the family Baculoviridae, and one is homologous to baculovirus rr1. A baculovirus odv-e66 homologue is also present in OrV. Five ORFs encode proteins\nhomologous to cellular thymidylate synthase (TS), patatin-like phospholipase, mitochondrial carrier protein, Ser=Thr protein phosphatase, and serine protease, respectively. TS is phylogenetically related to those of eukarya and nucleo-cytoplasmic large dsDNA viruses. However, the remaining 25 ORFs have poor or no sequence matches with the current databases. Both the gene content of the sequenced fragments and the phylogenetic analyses of the viral DNA polymerase suggest that OrV is most closely related to HzV-1. These ﬁndings and the re-evaluation of the relationship of HzV-1 to baculoviruses suggest that a new virus genus, Nudivirus, should be established, containing OrV and HzV-1, which are genetically related to members of the family Baculoviridae.","title":"Genomic analysis of Oryctes rhinoceros virus reveals genetic relatedness to Heliothis zea virus 1","creators":[{"firstName":"M.

The research aims to study the ecology of the density and composition of the stadia Oryctes rhinoceros in field. The study location was determined by purposive sampling method. The observed locations were the goat and cattle manure piles, garbage piles, rotten coconut trunks, and sawmills. The insects in these sites were recorded on its number and stadia (egg-larva (grub) -pupa-imago). Then, the population density and the stadia composition were calculated. To caoture adult of O. Rhinoceros beetle observed by using pheromone, called ferotrap. The larval breeding sites were found in 26 locations. The densities of O. rhinoceros in the breeding site were 0.2-3.7 head/ind/m2. Total of O. rhinoceros were 460, consisting of eggs (5.43%), 1st instar (4.78%), 2nd instar (14.13%), 3rd instar (72.39%), and pupae (1.73%) and imago (1.52%). The most abundant composition found in the habitat was the larval stage of O. rhinoceros especially the instar 3 larvae. There were 217 O. rhinoceros and 59 Rhynchophorussp captured for 12 weeks. The benefit of this research is to predict the exact time when the insects will turn into imago and attack the coconut plantations. Therefore, it can be useful for proper control strategies.","title":"DENSITY AND COMPOSITION OF Oryctes Rhinoceros (COLEOPTERA: SCARABAEIDAE) STADIA  IN FIELD","creators":[{"firstName":"Siska Dewi Anggraeni","lastName":"Dyah Rini Indriyanti","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"","lastName":"Muji Slamet","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-10-18T05:50:05Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:52Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/6IUG99V2","itemID":1919,"attachments":[{"key":"XZF7JW2T","version":224,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Dyah Rini Indriyanti et al. 2017.pdf","parentItem":"6IUG99V2","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Dyah Rini Indriyanti et al. 2017.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-10-18T05:51:05Z","dateModified":"2018-10-18T05:51:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/XZF7JW2T","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/XZF7JW2T/Dyah Rini Indriyanti et al. 2017.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1930/Dyah Rini Indriyanti et al. 2017.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303784,"version":0},"$loki":58},{"itemID":1885,"item":{"key":"6JBR74DG","version":723,"itemType":"conferencePaper","date":"2014","extra":"Citation Key: max_blake_dna_2014","conferenceName":"S23: Conservation ecology of European saproxylic insects","title":"DNA isolation from single pieces of beetle frass: a resource for conservation genetic studies of Gnorimus nobilis","creators":[{"firstName":"Niall J McKeown","lastName":"Max Blake","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"","lastName":"Paul W Shaw","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-10-11T22:38:55Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/6JBR74DG","itemID":1885,"attachments":[{"key":"INVGR69J","version":202,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Blakeetal.DNAExtractionfromBeetleFrass.pdf","parentItem":"6JBR74DG","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Blakeetal.DNAExtractionfromBeetleFrass.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-10-11T22:39:15Z","dateModified":"2018-10-11T22:39:15Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/INVGR69J","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/INVGR69J/Blakeetal.DNAExtractionfromBeetleFrass.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1887/Blakeetal.DNAExtractionfromBeetleFrass.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303784,"version":0},"$loki":59},{"itemID":1056,"item":{"key":"6NK7JKU4","version":709,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://guaminsects.net/anr/sites/default/files/CRB2014-02-12.pdf","date":"2014","extra":"Citation Key: marshall_dna_2014","title":"DNA analysis of Hawaii CRB","creators":[{"firstName":"Sean","lastName":"Marshall","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Aubrey","lastName":"Moore","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/6NK7JKU4","itemID":1056,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303785,"version":0},"$loki":60},{"itemID":2111,"item":{"key":"6UM72FRX","version":728,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"50","issue":"3","pages":"147-151","publicationTitle":"International Journal of Pest Management","date":"2004","extra":"Citation Key: blas_lavandero_need_2004","abstractNote":"Predators and parasitoids move through the landscape at a wide range of rates and over a broad range of spatial scales. Understanding the dispersal characteristics of such 'beneficials' is of crucial importance for classical, augmentative, inundative and conservation biological control. It is a key practice, following the release of 'classical' (exotic) and augmentative (indigenous) biological control agents, to assess whether they have become successfully established, and also to what extent the agent has spread from the release points. It is important in conservation biological control to understand the role that natural enemy movements play in the improvement of pest control achieved through the provision of pollen, nectar, shelter and/or alternative prey/hosts. Other aspects of predator and parasitoid movement pertinent to biological control are the role refugia play in influencing, via natural enemy movements, control of pest population numbers. In these areas and others, some form of marking and/or tracking of insect predators and parasitoids is usually required so that movements can be studied. This special issue considers the usefulness and limitations of marking and tracking techniques, through up-to-date reviews written by an international team of researchers who are actively involved in the study of predator and parasitoid ecology.","title":"The need for effective marking and tracking techniques for monitoring the movements of insect predators and parasitoids","creators":[{"firstName":"James Hagler","lastName":"Blas Lavandero","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mark Jervis","lastName":"Steve Wratten","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-03-13T23:11:55Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/6UM72FRX","itemID":2111,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303785,"version":0},"$loki":61},{"itemID":1114,"item":{"key":"6VEZWDSH","version":714,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://guaminsects.net/anr/sites/default/files/FS-CRB-Report-Sep-2014.pdf","date":"2014","extra":"Citation Key: moore_progress_2014","title":"Progress Report: Development of Integrated Pest Management for Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle on Guam","creators":[{"firstName":"Aubrey","lastName":"Moore","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:57Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/6VEZWDSH","itemID":1114,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303785,"version":0},"$loki":62},{"itemID":2366,"item":{"key":"6VKC8XZ2","version":772,"itemType":"webpage","url":"https://github.com/aubreymoore/CRB-Import-Permit/blob/master/CRB-import-permit-request-additional.pdf","date":"2019-06-02","extra":"Citation Key: moore_additional_2019","title":"Additional Documentation in Support of a Permit Application for Importation of Live Coconut Rhinoceros Beetles to Guam","creators":[{"firstName":"Aubrey","lastName":"Moore","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-14T01:16:58Z","dateModified":"2020-02-08T04:02:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/6VKC8XZ2","itemID":2366,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303786,"version":0},"$loki":63},{"itemID":1980,"item":{"key":"6ZPNCA5G","version":908,"itemType":"journalArticle","publicationTitle":"FAO Plant Protection Bulletin …","date":"1987","extra":"Citation Key: zelazny_b._preparation_1987","title":"Preparation of a baculovirus inoculum for use by coconut farmers to control rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros)","creators":[{"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Zelazny","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"A.

Despite the elaborate literature on mechanisms, robust data on costs and benefits of aggregation pheromones are scant. Existing literature indicates that, in contrast to the diversity of mechanisms, the ecological conditions in which aggregation pheromones are used are more alike. This points to a few general categories for costs and benefits of aggregation pheromones, and these are discussed. We subsequently review interspecific interactions that may be affected by the use of aggregation pheromones. We encounter a strikingly frequent association of aggregation pheromones with fungi and microorganisms and address cross-attraction by competitor species and exploitation by natural enemies. We show that aggregative behavior by individuals through the use of pheromones can profoundly affect ecological interactions and advocate further evolutionary and ecological investigations of pheromone-mediated aggregation.","title":"Pheromone-mediated aggregation in nonsocial arthropods: an evolutionary ecological perspective.","creators":[{"firstName":"Bregje","lastName":"Wertheim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Erik-Jan A","lastName":"Van Baalen","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Marcel","lastName":"Dicke","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Louise E M","lastName":"Vet","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"animals"},{"tag":"Pheromones"},{"tag":"Species Specificity"},{"tag":"arthropods"},{"tag":"arthropods physiology"},{"tag":"environment"},{"tag":"evolution"},{"tag":"pheromones physiology"},{"tag":"reproduction"},{"tag":"social behavior"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:25:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/7HCP7BQB","itemID":976,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303788,"version":0},"$loki":67},{"itemID":2305,"item":{"key":"7KPM2VQV","version":731,"itemType":"report","url":"https://pacificbasindevelopment.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CNMI-Rhino-Beetle-Plan.pdf","date":"2018","extra":"Citation Key: jackson_action_2018","accessDate":"2019-08-22T21:21:02Z","institution":"COMMONWEALTH OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS DEPARTMENT OF LANDS AND NATURAL RESOURCES","title":"Action Plan for Oryctes rhinoceros in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands 2018-2023","creators":[{"firstName":"Grahame","lastName":"Jackson","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-08-22T21:21:34Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/7KPM2VQV","itemID":2305,"attachments":[{"key":"DY34TMGK","version":452,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://pacificbasindevelopment.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CNMI-Rhino-Beetle-Plan.pdf","accessDate":"2019-08-22T21:21:02Z","title":"CNMI-Rhino-Beetle-Plan.pdf","parentItem":"7KPM2VQV","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"CNMI-Rhino-Beetle-Plan.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-08-22T21:21:02Z","dateModified":"2019-08-22T21:21:34Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/DY34TMGK","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/DY34TMGK/CNMI-Rhino-Beetle-Plan.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2304/CNMI-Rhino-Beetle-Plan.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303789,"version":0},"$loki":68},{"itemID":1112,"item":{"key":"7NVMP59C","version":714,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2760162","volume":"24","issue":"1-2","pages":"203-13","publicationTitle":"Journal of virological methods","date":"1989","extra":"Citation Key: mohan_quantitation_1989","abstractNote":"An assay was developed for quantitation of the antigenic relationship between viruses, by modification of the indirect ELISA.

Inhibition of GP activity by hyperglycaemia together with decline of hexokinase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, proves that the larvae might have adopted an energy conserving mechanism and thereby channelling glucose for the purpose of defense. Elevation of glucose-6-phosphatase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase during stress may also help them to synthesis defensive chemicals like glutathione and polyols. Existence of such a wonderful biochemical mechanism helps them to thrive very well in cow dung pits a microenvironment possessing biotic and abiotic stressors, without undergoing diapause.","title":"Modulation of Carbohydrate Metabolism in Asiatic Rhinoceros Beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros [L]) Grubs in Response to Various Stressors","creators":[{"firstName":"D.

Because of the shortage of adequate expertise, there has long been an interest in developing automated systems for this task. Previous attempts have been based on laborious and complex handcrafted extraction of image features, but in recent years it has been shown that sophisticated convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can learn to extract relevant features automatically, without human intervention. Unfortunately, reaching expert-level accuracy in CNN identiﬁcations requires substantial computational power and huge training data sets, which are often not available for taxonomic tasks. This can be addressed using feature transfer: a CNN that has been pretrained on a generic image classiﬁcation task is exposed to the taxonomic images of interest, and information about its perception of those images is used in training a simpler, dedicated identiﬁcation system. Here, we develop an effective method of CNN feature transfer, which achieves expert-level accuracy in taxonomic identiﬁcation of insects with training sets of 100 images or less per category, depending on the nature of data set. Speciﬁcally, we extract rich representations of intermediate to high-level image features from the CNN architecture VGG16 pretrained on the ImageNet data set. This information is submitted to a linear support vector machine classiﬁer, which is trained on the target problem. We tested the performance of our approach on two types of challenging taxonomic tasks: 1) identifying insects to higher groups when they are likely to belong to subgroups that have not been seen previously and 2) identifying visually similar species that are difﬁcult to separate even for experts. For the ﬁrst task, our approach reached >92% accuracy on one data set (884 face images of 11 families of Diptera, all specimens representing unique species), and >96% accuracy on another (2936 dorsal habitus images of 14 families of Coleoptera, over 90% of specimens belonging to unique species). For the second task, our approach outperformed a leading taxonomic expert on one data set (339 images of three species of the Coleoptera genus Oxythyrea; 97% accuracy), and both humans and traditional automated identiﬁcation systems on another data set (3845 images of nine species of Plecoptera larvae; 98.6 % accuracy). Reanalyzing several biological image identiﬁcation tasks studied in the recent literature, we show that our approach is broadly applicable and provides signiﬁcant improvements over previous methods, whether based on dedicated CNNs, CNN feature transfer, or more traditional techniques. Thus, our method, which is easy to apply, can be highly successful in developing automated taxonomic identiﬁcation systems even when training data sets are small and computational budgets limited. We conclude by brieﬂy discussing some promising CNNbased research directions in morphological systematics opened up by the success of these techniques in providing accurate diagnostic tools.","title":"Automated Taxonomic Identification of Insects with Expert-Level Accuracy Using Effective Feature Transfer from Convolutional Networks","creators":[{"firstName":"Miroslav","lastName":"Valan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Karoly","lastName":"Makonyi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Atsuto","lastName":"Maki","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dominik","lastName":"Vondráček","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Fredrik","lastName":"Ronquist","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Buckley","creatorType":"editor"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-07-16T10:32:54Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:25:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/8RTB3T2L","itemID":2278,"attachments":[{"key":"FK3KLMMI","version":430,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://watermark.silverchair.com/syz014.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAlkwggJVBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggJGMIICQgIBADCCAjsGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMAalUA0XXRWgs_3SkAgEQgIICDFpbQT3ODjWtBCNuB1Yjt_e2JOckqldnidiK4hj-dETyTC2Dye9_r2kbkYePN4dpLfHeWyoa1R4rfvUvkUzjFlv9vTJEPuZOCDoU1WBXqyHOI_5-vSLK5YPxcpT3zSgaHMJxRlHileKw76Ip107VmQFGJ5-uXyC5YArQ143sEz56o4gQiQwaEwHcufOsuw4iu4M8mTEfZkatMOImjPtQ2ZtJwROeu5ZUcNyOdwP2o5IRRLRlzqRt6glv1S6jtCuYKbzs5eIR38iglQEDBSdeZk51b4VdYm30XUEimOlyVUB97Va_4HJBXkZ0rDQKgwNgWmKv1XeQw8x3cHdTG6-AVVCezYjA-HkHzO_78VXZ1DJyDqLbSOYHvgqbTjhKR_D7X-JJ2lpmjwZXfzaPrTD2zaXqAtqpNgUXXrklxVvoEi2R14ZoHGFNtui82xRaGOXnaomLUrg1Sq85WvwKJm062rlcbjcpAlphSzHyK9y3S3CFJxmN88weWXzCmhFAlqWFRH6N61DCY8DuGjNTBNL8THhQ4bS2ImvBtfrsby2vBA6I9X02P3MvTIMy6WPDEmHkSwAiz9tmw4T5BhvsVULAQj_bo3MnBS6CI19a0h4_y7-n33PwCHRSP1ryzUsTY8p53J-KihoXKD_CSGV64dY67KGB_kAhj7tv4b5Dt2fzhiBaavlZWfJFRZuY823v","accessDate":"2019-07-16T10:32:48Z","title":"Valan et al. - 2019 - Automated Taxonomic Identification of Insects with.pdf","parentItem":"8RTB3T2L","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Valan et al. - 2019 - Automated Taxonomic Identification of Insects with.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-07-16T10:32:48Z","dateModified":"2019-07-16T10:32:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/FK3KLMMI","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/FK3KLMMI/Valan et al. - 2019 - Automated Taxonomic Identification of Insects with.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2277/Valan et al. - 2019 - Automated Taxonomic Identification of Insects with.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303796,"version":0},"$loki":78},{"itemID":1146,"item":{"key":"8T9BRZTJ","version":845,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.guaminsects.net/CRB/docs/Huger2005.pdf","volume":"89","issue":"1","pages":"78-84","publicationTitle":"Journal of Invertebrate Pathology","date":"May 2005","extra":"Citation Key: huger_oryctes_2005-1","DOI":"10.1016/j.jip.2005.02.010","abstractNote":"In view of the increasing and devastating damage by rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros) to coconut palms in the middle of last century, many efforts were made to find an efficient natural control factor against this pest, which could not be controlled by pesticides. The basic procedures of these monitoring programmes are outlined together with the final detection of a virus disease in oil palm estates in Malaysia in 1963. In extensive laboratory studies, the virus was isolated and identified as the first non-occluded, rod-shaped insect virus, morphologically resembling the baculoviruses. Infection experiments clarified the pathology, histopathology, and virulence of the virus and demonstrated that the virus was extremely virulent to larvae after peroral application. These findings encouraged the first pilot release of virus in 1967 in coconut plantations of Western Samoa where breeding sites were contaminated with virus. Surprisingly, the virus became established in the Samoan rhinoceros beetle populations and spread autonomously throughout the Western Samoan islands. As a consequence, there was a drastic decline of the beetle populations followed by a conspicuous recovery of the badly damaged coconut stands. This unexpected phenomenon could only be explained after it was shown that the adult beetle itself is a very active virus vector and thus was responsible for the efficient autodissemination of the virus. The functioning of the beetle as a 'flying virus factory' is due to the unique cytopathic process developing in the midgut after peroral virus infection. Pathological details of this process are presented. Because of the long-term persistence of the virus in the populations, rhinoceros beetle control is maintained. Incorporation of virus into integrated control measures and successful virus releases in many other countries are recorded. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Viruses invade cells where they proliferate, resulting in disease.\nSterilization, disinfection, and antisepsis are important for preventing diseases derived\nfrom pathogens such as viruses. The disinfectants used for viruses are mostly chemicals\nincluding alcohols like ethanol and isopropanol. Alcohols are effective against enveloped\nviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza virus but not small\nnon-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus and poliovirus. To develop methods of\nsterilization, confirmation of results using appropriate samples is necessary. Towards this\ngoal, several physical methods have recently been developed to facilitate sterilization;\nincluding the use of pulsed light, supercritical fluids, pulsed electric fields, and gas\nplasma. Although most of these methods have not been widely adopted, further increases\nin reliability, convenience, and suitability should contribute to the spread of their\napplicability. In this review, we describe viruses, conventional means of disinfection,\ntrends in the development of new methods of sterilization and potential applications of\nthese methods.","title":"INACTIVATION OF VIRUSES","creators":[{"firstName":"Takashi Onodera","lastName":"Akikazu Sakudo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"","lastName":"Yasuharu Tanaka","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-10-10T22:39:27Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/9DK7H7QH","itemID":1886,"attachments":[{"key":"2A32K2PV","version":198,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Akikazu Sakudo et al. 2010 virus inactivation.pdf","parentItem":"9DK7H7QH","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Akikazu Sakudo et al. 2010 virus inactivation.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-10-10T22:40:38Z","dateModified":"2018-10-10T22:40:38Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/2A32K2PV","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/2A32K2PV/Akikazu Sakudo et al. 2010 virus inactivation.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1888/Akikazu Sakudo et al. 2010 virus inactivation.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303810,"version":0},"$loki":88},{"itemID":1007,"item":{"key":"9FG2TGGT","version":704,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/guaminsects.net/anr/sites/default/files/bestWaySQL.ipynb","date":"2015","extra":"Citation Key: moore_best_2015","title":"Best Way to Access Data in the Guam Coconut Rhinoceros Project Database","creators":[{"firstName":"Aubrey","lastName":"Moore","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"cfes2015"},{"tag":"crbtechreport"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/9FG2TGGT","itemID":1007,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303811,"version":0},"$loki":89},{"itemID":2610,"item":{"key":"9GXPIUVV","version":1009,"itemType":"document","url":"https://github.com/aubreymoore/FY19-PPA-Report-1/blob/master/PPA19-report-1.pdf","date":"2020-03-20","extra":"Citation Key: moore_progress_2020","title":"Progress Report 1 for USDA-APHIS-PPA19 Grant: Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle Biocontrol","creators":[{"firstName":"Aubrey","lastName":"Moore","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"addendum"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2020-03-20T20:25:11Z","dateModified":"2020-05-07T21:51:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/9GXPIUVV","itemID":2610,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303812,"version":0},"$loki":90},{"itemID":1083,"item":{"key":"9NGENFJZ","version":711,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.guaminsects.net/CRB/docs/Moore 2007 Assessment of the Rhinoceros Beetle Infestation on Guam.doc","date":"2007","extra":"Citation Key: moore_assessment_2007","title":"Assessment of the Rhinoceros Beetle Infestation on Guam","creators":[{"firstName":"Aubrey","lastName":"Moore","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:56Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/9NGENFJZ","itemID":1083,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303812,"version":0},"$loki":91},{"itemID":2339,"item":{"key":"A4GUAYPT","version":732,"itemType":"report","pages":"165","date":"March 25, 2019","extra":"Citation Key: moore_progress_2019","institution":"University of Guam","title":"Progress Report 3 for USDA-APHIS Grant AP17PPQFO000C312: Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle Biological Control","creators":[{"firstName":"Aubrey","lastName":"Moore","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-09-25T04:51:44Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/A4GUAYPT","itemID":2339,"attachments":[{"key":"IMIHN2JP","version":519,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Moore -

Current trends of application of DNA marker techniques in diverse domains of insect ecological studies show that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), microsatellites, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), expressed sequence tags (EST) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers have contributed significantly for progresses towards understanding genetic basis of insect diversity and for mapping medically and agriculturally important genes and quantitative trait loci in insect pests. Apart from these popular marker systems, other novel approaches including transposon display, sequence-specific amplification polymorphism (S-SAP), repeat-associated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) markers have been identified as alternate marker systems in insect studies. Besides, whole genome microarray and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assays are becoming more popular to screen genome-wide polymorphisms in fast and cost effective manner. However, use of such methodologies has not gained widespread popularity in entomological studies. The current study highlights the recent trends of applications of molecular markers in insect studies and explores the technological advancements in molecular marker tools and modern high throughput genotyping methodologies that may be applied in entomological researches for better understanding of insect ecology at molecular level.","title":"Molecular marker systems in insects: current trends and future avenues","creators":[{"firstName":"","lastName":"SUSANTA K.

Augmentative release of OrNV continues to be an important mechanism for CRB management in both coconut and oil palm growing regions. For ~40 years after adoption of this biocontrol strategy, no new outbreaks of CRB were reported from uninfested palm growing countries and islands in the Pacific ensuring continuity of palm based village economies. However, the situation has recently changed. For first time in ~40 years, CRB invasion into completely new areas has been reported in the Pacific, being detected first in Tumon Bay in Guam 2007, followed by Port Moresby in PNG 2010, Honolulu in Hawaii 2013, and Honiara in Solomon Islands 2015. Additionally, Pacific areas with established CRB populations (e.g. Palau) have reported increased severity and frequency of CRB damage. Common to all these areas is the high incidence of severe palm damage, not seen since the introduction of OrNV. Initial attempts to introduce OrNV into the Guam CRB population were unexpectedly unsuccessful, raising the possibility that the CRB-G population that invaded Guam could be tolerant or resistant to the commonly applied OrNV isolates. Analysis of several CRB populations has demonstrated that the CRB-G biotype is also found in Hawaii, Palau, and recently (February 2015) in Port Moresby (PNG), with Honiara (Solomon Islands) still to be confirmed. We will discuss current results in relation to what is known about these new invasions and potential implications for the future.","title":"A new invasive biotype of the coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros) has escaped from biocontrol by Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus","proceedingsTitle":"International Congress on Invertebrate Pathology and Microbial Control and the 48th Annual Meeting of the Society for Invertebrate Pathology","creators":[{"firstName":"Sean David Goldie","lastName":"Marshall","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maclean","lastName":"Vaqalo","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Aubrey","lastName":"Moore","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Quitugua","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Trevor A","lastName":"Jackson","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/B76RNTJX","itemID":1011,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303822,"version":0},"$loki":104},{"itemID":1102,"item":{"key":"B7FFJFVC","version":713,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"76","issue":"4","pages":"723-727","publicationTitle":"Journal of Economic Entomology","date":"1983","extra":"Citation Key: vandermeer_structure-activity_1983","title":"Structure-activity correlations for derivatives of siglure-attractants for Oryctes rhinoceros L.

Based on initial delimiting surveys it was determined that it had likely been there for at least two generations before it was detected and that consequently eradication was not an option. Soon after, scientists at AgResearch, New Zealand, confirmed it was the 'G' (Guam) strain of the species that is not susceptible to the nudivirus that controls another strain of CRB elsewhere in the South Pacific. An emergency response plan was developed but due to inadequate financing implementation has been inconsistent and weak, consequently it has spread and is now reported on parts of seven islands. More recently some funding has become available and a three-pronged management approach is being implemented: sanitation to reduce populations by destroying breeding sites (rotting palm logs, green manure, compost and chicken manure), restricting spread through internal quarantines on shipping and biological control by identifying effective entomopathogens for the long term. Work to identify strains of Oryctes Nudivirus (OrNV) effective against CRB-G is reported elsewhere in this symposium. Some preliminary details of work to introduce the green muscardine fungus, Metarhyzium anisopleae, are reported here.","title":"The status of Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros (L) Scarabaeidae : Dynastinae, in Solomon Islands.","creators":[{"firstName":"Francis","lastName":"Tsatsia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Hilda","lastName":"Wratten","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Maria","lastName":"Gharuka","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Crispus","lastName":"Fanai","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Dudley","lastName":"Wate","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Helen","lastName":"Tsatsia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Bob","lastName":"Macfarlane","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-08-22T21:33:10Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:25:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/BSTRV84F","itemID":2307,"attachments":[{"key":"3ZYXXR7I","version":459,"itemType":"attachment","url":"http://devpolicy.org/pdf/blog/Status-of-the-coconut-rhinoceros-beetle.pdf","accessDate":"2019-08-22T21:33:08Z","title":"Tsatsia et al. -

The percentage of baculovirus-infected breeding sites increased with density of dead standing palms up to about five dead palms per hectare, but then decreased again.

The results and those of previous surveys showed that the baculovirus disease usually has little influence on the overall survival rate of O. rhinoceros larvae, but that it reduces dramatically the average life span of the adult beetles. This and the ability of the virus disease to persist at low host densities are the main reasons for its success as a microbial control agent. The data provide additional evidence that the presence of a low number of dead standing palms per hectare promotes the spread of the virus disease because these are highly attractive to adult beetles.

This letter presents a harmonic radar system proposed to track the migration of the Emerald Ash Borer (EAB). The system offers a unique combination of portability, low power and small tag design. It is comprised of a compact radar unit and a passive RF tag for mounting on the insect. The radar unit transmits a 5.9–6 GHz signal and detects at the 11.8–12 GHz band. A prototype of the radar unit was built and tested, and a new small tag was designed for the application. The new tag offers improved harmonic conversion efﬁciency and much smaller size as compared to previous harmonic radar systems for tracking insects. Unlike RFID detectors whose sensitivity allows detection up to a few meters, the developed radar can detect a tagged insect up to 58 m (190 ft).","title":"A Portable Low-Power Harmonic Radar System and Conformal Tag for Insect Tracking","creators":[{"firstName":"D.","lastName":"Psychoudakis","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"W.","lastName":"Moulder","creatorType":"author"},{"name":"Chi-Chih Chen","creatorType":"author"},{"name":"Heping Zhu","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J.L.","lastName":"Volakis","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2020-04-13T20:08:34Z","dateModified":"2020-04-13T20:08:48Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/DIREGXKK","itemID":2658,"attachments":[{"key":"95BS4NA8","version":850,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/pubag/downloadPDF.xhtml?content=PDF&id=53786","accessDate":"2020-04-13T20:08:30Z","title":"Psychoudakis et al. - 2008 - A Portable Low-Power Harmonic Radar System and Con.pdf","parentItem":"DIREGXKK","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Psychoudakis et al. - 2008 - A Portable Low-Power Harmonic Radar System and Con.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2020-04-13T20:08:30Z","dateModified":"2020-04-13T20:08:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/95BS4NA8","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/95BS4NA8/Psychoudakis et al. - 2008 - A Portable Low-Power Harmonic Radar System and Con.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2657/Psychoudakis et al. - 2008 - A Portable Low-Power Harmonic Radar System and Con.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303867,"version":0},"$loki":130},{"itemID":1847,"item":{"key":"DKHICAVE","version":722,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"42","pages":"367-372","publicationTitle":"Australian J.

This species causes severe economic impacts on coconut palms in young plantations. Flights to feeding, mating, resting, and possibly oviposition sites covered distances of 52 to 835 m in males, and from 245 m to >1000 m in females. Upon release, females flew in a tight upward spiral above canopy level (>20 m), then usually flew along a single bearing out of radio reception within 1 min of initiating flight. Dispersing females probably follow scent trails to pheromone-releasing males that occupy feeding galleries excavated most frequently in coconut palms, or search for oviposition sites. Most tagged females were not found again, because they dispersed beyond the tracking capabilities of our radio-receivers, but one female was followed for 245 m to a feeding gallery excavated by an adult male. Males typically flew within 5 m of the ground, took erratic flight paths with numerous turns, and frequently circled coconuts and other host plants. We followed males from the release point until they ceased flight for a night. Males passed daylight hours either in a feeding gallery within a host plant or under soil litter.","title":"Flight movement of Scapanes australis australis(Boisduval) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Dynastinae) in Papua New Guinea: a radiotelemetry study","creators":[{"firstName":"Frank Bonaccorso","lastName":"Laurence Beaudoin-Ollivier","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mathew Kasiki","lastName":"Michael Aloysius","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-10-09T06:30:21Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/DKHICAVE","itemID":1847,"attachments":[{"key":"M64F22BT","version":121,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Beaudoin-ollivieretal.2003_Radiotelemtrie_Scapanes (1).pdf","parentItem":"DKHICAVE","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Beaudoin-ollivieretal.2003_Radiotelemtrie_Scapanes (1).pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-10-09T06:30:37Z","dateModified":"2018-10-09T06:30:37Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/M64F22BT","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/M64F22BT/Beaudoin-ollivieretal.2003_Radiotelemtrie_Scapanes (1).pdf","defaultPath":"files/1873/Beaudoin-ollivieretal.2003_Radiotelemtrie_Scapanes (1).pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303867,"version":0},"$loki":131},{"itemID":1154,"item":{"key":"DNH9GDBP","version":718,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"215","pages":"210-215","publicationTitle":"Journal of Invertebrate Pathology","date":"1977","extra":"Citation Key: zelazny_oryctes_1977","title":"Oryctes rhinoceros populations and behavior influenced by a baculovirus","creators":[{"firstName":"B.","lastName":"Zelazny","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:25:05Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/DNH9GDBP","itemID":1154,"attachments":[{"key":"DFRZ5S7A","version":11,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Zelazny -

Until now, butterfly mobility has been predominantly studied using visual\nobservations and mark–recapture experiments. Attachment of a light-weight radar transponder to the\nbutterfly’s thorax did not significantly affect behaviour or mobility. Tracks were analysed for straightness,\nduration, displacement, ground speed, foraging and the influence of linear landscape features on flight\ndirection. Two main styles of track were identified: (A) fast linear flight and (B) slower nonlinear flights\ninvolving a period of foraging and/or looped sections of flight. These loops potentially perform an\norientation function, and were often associated with areas of forage. In the absence of forage, linear features\ndid not provide a guiding effect on flight direction, and only dense treelines were perceived as barriers. The\nresults provide tentative support for non-random dispersal and a perceptual range of 100–200 m for these\nspecies.

OrNV continues to be an important biocontrol\nagent for the control of Oryctes rhinoceros in both coconut and\noil palm growing regions. Augmentative release of OrNV is\ncommonly used to enhance the natural spread and ensure its\ncontinued presence within palm growing regions and\nsurrounding areas. For over four decades after the distribution\nof the virus, O. rhinoceros was not reported to have\nestablished in any new regions. However, in 2007 the beetle\nwas discovered in Guam and the population has now\nestablished with a highly damaging outbreak such as those not\nseen for 40+ years. Initial attempts to introduce OrNV into the\nGuam population were unexpectedly unsuccessful. This has\nraised the possibility the O. rhinoceros population that invaded\nGuam is less susceptible to OrNV, or potentially resistant.\nFurthermore, near the end of 2013, a population of O.\nrhinoceros was detected in Hawaii, although it is not believed\nto have established yet. The discovery of new O. rhinoceros\ninvasions within the Pacific region linked with the possibility of\na virus tolerant population suggests the beetle may again be\non the move. To assist efforts in identifying the source\npopulations for the Guam outbreak, a simple PCR-RFLP\nmethod has been developed to distinguish Guam O.\nrhinoceros from other populations. Analysis of several O.\nrhinoceros populations has demonstrated that the Hawaiian\nbeetles are of the same haplotype as those found in Guam.\nWe will discuss current results in relation to what is known\nabout these new invasions and potential implications for the\nfuture.","title":"Oryctes rhinoceros population diversity and potential implications for control using Oryctes nudivirus","creators":[{"firstName":"Sean","lastName":"Marshall","creatorType":"presenter"},{"firstName":"Aubrey","lastName":"Moore","creatorType":"presenter"},{"firstName":"Russell","lastName":"Campbell","creatorType":"presenter"},{"firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Quitugua","creatorType":"presenter"},{"firstName":"Trevor","lastName":"Jackson","creatorType":"presenter"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-17T09:14:13Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/DWB25F8U","itemID":1077,"attachments":[],"notes":[{"key":"2KVMM9UP","version":40,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"DWB25F8U","note":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-17T09:17:15Z","dateModified":"2016-04-17T09:17:15Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/2KVMM9UP"}]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303873,"version":0},"$loki":138},{"itemID":1124,"item":{"key":"DWJXBTP4","version":715,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"68","issue":"5","pages":"867-868","publicationTitle":"Annals of the Entomological Society of America","date":"1975","extra":"Citation Key: vander_meer_indirect_1975","title":"Indirect Methods of Determining the Emergent Weight of Oryctes rhinoceros (L.)","creators":[{"firstName":"Robert K","lastName":"Vander Meer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J A","lastName":"Mclean","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:25:04Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/DWJXBTP4","itemID":1124,"attachments":[{"key":"4ZBIADU5","version":5,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Vander Meer, Mclean - 1975 - Indirect Methods of Determining the Emergent Weight of Oryctes rhinoceros (L.)","parentItem":"DWJXBTP4","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Vander Meer, Mclean - 1975 - Indirect Methods of Determining the Emergent Weight of Oryctes rhinoceros (L.).pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/4ZBIADU5","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/4ZBIADU5/Vander Meer, Mclean - 1975 - Indirect Methods of Determining the Emergent Weight of Oryctes rhinoceros (L.).pdf","defaultPath":"files/1210/Vander Meer, Mclean - 1975 - Indirect Methods of Determining the Emergent Weight of Oryctes rhinoceros (L.).pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303874,"version":0},"$loki":139},{"itemID":1018,"item":{"key":"DWNG6QMA","version":705,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10905-012-9334-8","volume":"26","issue":"1","pages":"51-56","publicationTitle":"Journal of Insect Behavior","ISSN":"1090501293","date":"2013","extra":"Citation Key: mccullough_using_2013","DOI":"10.1007/s10905-012-9334-8","title":"Using Radio Telemetry to Assess Movement Patterns in a Giant Rhinoceros Beetle: Are There Differences Among Majors, Minors, and Females?","creators":[{"firstName":"Erin L.","lastName":"McCullough","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"male dimorphism"},{"tag":"movement"},{"tag":"radio telemetry"},{"tag":"Trypoxylus dichotomus"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/DWNG6QMA","itemID":1018,"attachments":[{"key":"PCPMTTMB","version":12,"itemType":"attachment","title":"McCullough 2013-2","parentItem":"DWNG6QMA","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"McCullough 2013-2.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/PCPMTTMB","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/PCPMTTMB/McCullough 2013-2.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1280/McCullough 2013-2.pdf"}],"notes":[{"key":"UEWP5TGH","version":3,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"DWNG6QMA","note":"<p>From Duplicate 2 (Using Radio Telemetry to Assess Movement Patterns in a Giant Rhinoceros Beetle: Are There Differences Among Majors, Minors, and Females?

Many people know about extinction of Guam's birds by the brown tree snake which invaded the island shortly after WWII. But the contemporary ecological disaster which is currently happening in Guam's forests is not well known. In 2002 a US Forest Service survey found the endemic cycad, Cycas micronesica, to be the most abundant tree in Guam's forests and coconut palm, Cocos nucifera, to be the second most abundant tree. Both species are now under severe attack by invasive insect species. About 90% of C. micronesica trees have been killed by Asian cycad scale, Aulacaspis yasumatsui, first detected in 2003. The predatory beetle, Rhyzobius lophanthae, was introduced and it is protecting mature plants but no seedlings are surviving. Coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros, was first detected in 2007 and an uncontrolled outbreak of this pest is currently killing coconut palms throughout the island. Following a failed eradication attempt, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) and Metarhizium majus fungus were introduced as biocontrol agents. OrNV unexpectedly failed as a biocontrol agent for CRB on Guam. Previously, this pathogen produced excellent results when released on Pacific Islands infested with CRB. Subsequent laboratory bioassays and genetic analysis showed that the CRB which invaded Guam belong to an OrNV resistant biotype named CRB-G which is involved in all recent invasions of CRB in the Pacific. The fungus, M. majus rapidly established and spread to CRB breeding sites throughout the island, with infection rates measured between 10% and 38%. But this level of suppression was not enough to prevent the current outbreak which was triggered by abundant breeding sites left in the wake of Typhoon Dolphin which passed over Guam in May 2015. Attempts to overcome these IPM failures will be discussed.","title":"Failed Attempts to Establish IPM for Asian Cycad Scale and Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle on Guam","creators":[{"firstName":"Aubrey","lastName":"Moore","creatorType":"presenter"}],"tags":[{"tag":"McIntire-Stennis final report 2019"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-05-27T10:32:54Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/DXMF7L4S","itemID":2222,"attachments":[{"key":"QS3IMJZH","version":388,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://zenodo.org/record/2545065/files/Moore-Vancouver-2018.pdf","accessDate":"2019-01-21T07:24:57Z","title":"Zenodo Full Text PDF","parentItem":"DXMF7L4S","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Moore - 2019 - Failed Attempts to Establish IPM for Asian Cycad S.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-05-27T10:32:54Z","dateModified":"2019-05-27T10:32:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/QS3IMJZH","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/QS3IMJZH/Moore - 2019 - Failed Attempts to Establish IPM for Asian Cycad S.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2223/Moore - 2019 - Failed Attempts to Establish IPM for Asian Cycad S.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303876,"version":0},"$loki":142},{"itemID":1129,"item":{"key":"DZTT87FI","version":715,"itemType":"conferencePaper","pages":"1-2","date":"2015","extra":"Citation Key: moore_failure_2015","title":"Failure Analysis of the Guam Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle Eradication Project Aubrey Moore Western Pacific Tropical Research Center","proceedingsTitle":"Pacific Entomology Conference","creators":[{"firstName":"Aubrey","lastName":"Moore","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Western","lastName":"Pacific","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:25:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/DZTT87FI","itemID":1129,"attachments":[{"key":"CBENVEWS","version":11,"itemType":"attachment","title":"pec2015-crb-failure","parentItem":"DZTT87FI","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"pec2015-crb-failure.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/CBENVEWS","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/CBENVEWS/pec2015-crb-failure.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1321/pec2015-crb-failure.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303876,"version":0},"$loki":143},{"itemID":2327,"item":{"key":"E326JUPX","version":492,"itemType":"attachment","title":"INFECTIVITY_OF_Oryctes_NUDIVIRUS_PRODUCE.pdf","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"INFECTIVITY_OF_Oryctes_NUDIVIRUS_PRODUCE.pdf","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-09-07T00:24:44Z","dateModified":"2019-09-07T00:24:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/E326JUPX","itemID":2327,"localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/E326JUPX/INFECTIVITY_OF_Oryctes_NUDIVIRUS_PRODUCE.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2327/INFECTIVITY_OF_Oryctes_NUDIVIRUS_PRODUCE.pdf"},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303877,"version":0},"$loki":144},{"itemID":2359,"item":{"key":"E7CAGVZA","version":732,"itemType":"report","url":"https://github.com/aubreymoore/FB18-Report-2/raw/master/Grasela-September%202019%20Progress%20Report.pdf","pages":"2","date":"2019-09-29","extra":"Citation Key: grasela_progress_2019","institution":"University of Guam","title":"Progress in Bioassays of OrNV Isolates to Detect Biocontrol Candidates for CRB-G","creators":[{"firstName":"James","lastName":"Grasela","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-11T19:15:40Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/E7CAGVZA","itemID":2359,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303877,"version":0},"$loki":145},{"itemID":1030,"item":{"key":"E7SHPX4V","version":706,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"6","issue":"12","pages":"5135-5144","publicationTitle":"Viruses","date":"2014","extra":"Citation Key: graillot_progressive_2014","DOI":"10.3390/v6125135","abstractNote":"The NPP-R1 isolate of CpGV is able to replicate on CpGV-M-resistant codling moths.

Feral goats (Capra hircus) are particularly devastating to island ecosystems, causing direct and indirect impacts through overgrazing, which often results in ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss. Removing goat populations from islands is a powerful conservation tool to prevent extinctions and restore ecosystems. Goats have been eradicated successfully from 120 islands worldwide.With newly developed technology and techniques, island size is perhaps no longer a limiting factor in the successful removal of introduced goat populations. Furthermore, the use of global positioning systems, geographic information systems, aerial hunting by helicopter, specialized hunting dogs, and Judas goats has dramatically increased efficiency and significantly reduced the duration of eradication campaigns. Intensive monitoring programs are also critical for successful eradications. Because of the presence of humans with domestic goat populations on large islands, future island conservation actions will require eradication programs that involve local island inhabitants in a collaborative approach with biologists, sociologists, and educators. Given the clear biodiversity benefits, introduced goat populations should be routinely removed from islands.","title":"Feral goat eradications on islands","creators":[{"firstName":"Karl","lastName":"Campbell","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"C.

Radiotelemetry collars are fitted to select goats, which are released and allowed to seek out other goats. Judas goats are then radio tracked, either on foot or by helicopter, and accompany- ing goats are shot. Judas goats are then allowed to escape to seek out other goats and are then rechecked at a later date. This approach allows the last individuals to be re- moved (Rainbolt &amp; Coblentz 1999). Judas goats have been used successfully in a number<br/>of eradications: San Clemente and Santa Catalina islands (California, U.S.A.); Kaho’olawe Island (Hawaii, U.S.A.), Ile Malabar and Ile Picard(Republic of Seychelles),Woody Island (Australia), and Pinta Island (Gal´<br/>apagos, Ecuador;<br/>Allen 1991; Kaho’olawe Island Conveyance Commission 1993;Keegan et al. 1994; Rainbolt&amp;Coblentz 1999; Schu- yler et al. 2002; Campbell et al. 2004).

The use of Judas goats fina- lly removed the last 263 individuals (Keegan et al. 1994). Recently developed methods involve hormone therapy and sterilization techniques that should improve the ef- ficacy of Judas goats (Campbell 2002).

The tag consists of a wire antenna attached to a Schottky diode, which uses the original radar signal as\nan energy source, re-emitting a harmonic of the transmitted wavelength. Two forms of harmonic radar use this basic technology to\nstudy insect movement. The more sophisticated form consists of a\nground-based scanning radar station that tracks the movement of a\ntagged insect on a circular radar display. A simpler, “off-the-shelf”\nform of harmonic radar is a commercially available, light-weight,\nhandheld transmitter/receiver from RECCO Rescue Systems. We\nbriefly review both of these forms and describe our experience\nmonitoring the movement of carabid beetles in agricultural habitats\nwith the handheld transmitter/receiver. We identified a commercial\nsource of diodes compatible with the RECCO transmitter/receiver\nand tested several diode and wire combinations. We found that a tag\nbuilt with a diode attached to a single section of 8-cm wire (monopole) was more appropriate for marking carabids. Tags built from\nflexible Teflon-coated wires were an improvement on tags built with\nstiff, aluminum wire, but beetle movement was still hindered. In corn\nand soybean fields, large carabids (Scarites quadriceps Chaudoir and\nHarpalus pennsylvanicus, (DeG.) Coleoptera: Carabidae) could be\nrecaptured even when they burrowed out of sight 3 to 9 cm below\nthe soil surface. We discuss the trade-offs between tag detection and\ndurability that occur when designing a tag for a given organism.\nAlthough the technique shows promise, producing a tag that does\nnot hinder movement of the target insect in the field will require\nfurther development.","title":"Tracking Insects with Harmonic Radar: a Case Study","creators":[{"firstName":"D.

The virus DNA was extracted from the gut tissues by a robust method. Using a pair of specific primers, Primer 15a and 15b, infection was confirmed when the PCR product produced a single 945 bp DNA band.  The optimized concentrations of the PCR components were at 2.0 mM MgCl2, 1.0 mM 10X PCR buffer, 0.2 mM Primer 15a and 15b, 0.5 U Taq-DNA polymerase and 0.4 mg bovine serum albumin (BSA).  All tested virus DNA concentrations at 0.085, 0.170 and 0.255 μg μl-1 were suitable for virus detection.  Addition of BSA (20 mg ml-1) at 0.4 mg in the reaction increased the PCR sensitivity. The method is capable of detecting OrV infection from DNA diluted one million times or equivalent to a virus DNA concentration as low as 2.23 pg μl-1. The PCR detected 83.2% adult beetles from pheromone traps as being infected by OrV, 13.6% higher (P<0.05) than the results based on observations on the gut morphological appearance (69.6%). A typical OrV infection symptom is a swollen gut filled with milky fluid.  Of the 839 guts with this symptom, 97.6% were diagnosed to be infected which was not significantly different (P>0.05) compared to the method based on gut morphological appearance. The PCR was also capable in detecting virus at an early infection stage and in dead adults with decayed tissues. Of the 307 adults that appeared to be healthy, 36.1% of them were found to be infected.  As much as 61.6% of dead adults with decayed tissues (N = 428) were diagnosed to be infected by the OrV.  The method can be used in further research studies relating to OrV for the management of the rhinoceros beetle. \n\n(16) (PDF) Optimization of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for the detection of Oryctes rhinoceros virus.

In a laboratory colony maintained for production of Oryctes virus, an important biocontrol agent of this major coconut pest, approximately 52% of the grubs succumbed to septicaemia with similar symptoms. The bacterium was found to be a component of the gut microflora of healthy grubs. Occurrence of the viral infection naturally or when induced in the laboratory in the O. rhinoceros grubs, appeared to be one of the biotic stress factors for P.alcaligenes to become an opportunistic pathogen. A preponderance of this bacterial infection in field populations during the periods when natural viral infection in grubs was above average, agrees with this observation. This finding becomes significant as infection by the opportunistic bacterial pathogen, P. alcaligenes , reduces the production of Oryctes virus inoculum in nature and limits the field-perpetuation of this viral biocontrol agent.","title":"An Opportunistic Bacterial Pathogen, Pseudomonas alcaligenes , May Limit the Perpetuation of Oryctes Virus, a Biocontrol Agent of Oryctes rhinoceros L.","creators":[{"firstName":"Alka Gupta","lastName":"Murali Gopal","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-10-10T00:27:49Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:25:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/HAQ8433B","itemID":1831,"attachments":[{"key":"4DKNH8I7","version":164,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Gopal, M.

Therefore, we first tested the applicability of fluorescent\nmarking system on Riptortus pedestris (Hemiptera: Alydidae). Then, we evaluated the efficacy of the two methods used either\nalone or combined in a grass field and bean field, varying with complexity, during day and night.\nRESULTS: Fluorescent marking did not affect the behavior or fitness of Riptortus pedestris except for vertical walking, while\nallowing the detection from >25 m when paired with a handheld laser. Generally, the portable harmonic radar system and both\nmethods combined were more successful in sample detection, although the fluorescent marking system in the bean field at night\nwas as competitive as the two. Combining both methods made sample retrieval easier at night than the portable harmonic radar\nsystem. Nevertheless, the total detection time showed a large variance across the methods.\nCONCLUSION: The portable harmonic radar system can be an effective detection method in either landscape during both day\nand night. Furthermore, the fluorescent marking system can be a reliable tool at night as well. Lastly, combining both methods\ncan improve the night detection.\n© 2018 Society of Chemical Industry","title":"Evaluating the efficacy of two insect detection methods with Riptortus pedestris (Hemiptera: Alydidae): portable harmonic radar system and fluorescent marking system","creators":[{"firstName":"Minhyung Jung","lastName":"Jung-Wook Kho","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"","lastName":"Doo-Hyung Lee","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-03-11T06:18:32Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:54Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/J2PG52GU","itemID":2092,"attachments":[{"key":"3ZEZFM87","version":318,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Evaulating the efficacy of two insecr detection methods.pdf","parentItem":"J2PG52GU","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Evaulating the efficacy of two insecr detection methods.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-03-11T06:18:58Z","dateModified":"2019-03-11T06:18:58Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/3ZEZFM87","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/3ZEZFM87/Evaulating the efficacy of two insecr detection methods.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2096/Evaulating the efficacy of two insecr detection methods.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303926,"version":0},"$loki":197},{"itemID":1999,"item":{"key":"J5CS5IKC","version":897,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"46","issue":"1","pages":"8-11","publicationTitle":"Journal of Plantation Crops","date":"2018","extra":"Citation Key: t._srinivasan_validation_2018","abstractNote":"Juvenile palms in the age group of one to six years are prone to damage in the crown by rhinoceros beetle.

However, little is known about growth and metabolism of this cell line, knowledge of which is necessary to develop an in vitro large-scale OrNV production process. The strong anchorage-dependent characteristics of the cell line, its particular fragility and its tendency to form dense clumps when manipulated, are the most likely reasons that have precluded further development of the cell line. In order to characterize DSIR-HA-1179 cells, there was first a need for a reliable technique to count the cells. A homogenous cell suspension suitable for enumeration could be produced by treatment with TrypLE Express™ with optimum mean time for cell release calculated as 30 min. The cell line was adapted to grow in four serum-supplemented culture media namely TC-100, IPL-41, Sf-900 II and Sf-900 III and cell growth, glucose consumption, lactate and ammonia production were assessed from static-batch cultures. The maximum viable cell density was reached in Sf-900 II (17.9 × 10(5) cells/ml), with the maximum specific growth rate observed in this culture medium as well (0.0074 h(-1)). Higher production of OrNV was observed in IPL-41 and TC-100 (4.1 × 10(7) TCID50/ml) than in cultures infected in Sf-900 III (2.0 × 10(7) TCID50/ml) and Sf-900 II (1.4 × 10(7) TCID50/ml). At the end of the growth period, glucose was completely consumed in cultures grown in TC-100, while remained in excess in the other three culture media. The cell line produced lactate and ammonia to very low levels in the TC-100 culture medium which is a promising aspect for its cultivation at large-scale.","title":"Characterization of growth and Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus production in attached cultures of the DSIR-HA-1179 coleopteran insect cell line.","creators":[{"firstName":"Charlotte","lastName":"Pushparajan","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Juan Daniel","lastName":"Claus","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sean David Goldie","lastName":"Marshall","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gabriel","lastName":"Visnovsky","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"arator á"},{"tag":"attachment dependent insect cell"},{"tag":"counting á metabolism"},{"tag":"dsir-ha-1179 á oryctes"},{"tag":"line á cell"},{"tag":"rhinoceros nudivirus á heteronychus"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:25:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/J95TSMKU","itemID":1139,"attachments":[{"key":"F75QP5M5","version":11,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Pushparajan et al. -

Asia-Pacific Entomol.","date":"2007","extra":"Citation Key: norman_hj_kamarudin_effects_2007","abstractNote":"Abstract The infestation levels of O. rhinoceros were investigated in the oil palm trunk heaps in three replanting blocks (Blocks A, B and C) at Sepang, Selangor, Malaysia. These blocks had different densities of pheromone trapping: high (11 traps per ha, Block B), normal (1 trap per 2 ha, Block C), while no pheromone trapping was conducted in (Block A. Without pheromone trapping, the infestation levels of O. rhinoceros can reach a maximum density of between 25 to 50 individuals per m2 (IPMS). The O. rhinoceros population was still detected in the heaps up to more than two years (at 26 months after replanting). With high density trapping, infestation levels were maintained below 10 IPMS and was not detected in the heaps after a period of 16 months of replanting. In the normal trapping density, the population was also maintained below 10 IPMS but had sustained itself in the heaps for up to 24 months. The mortality factors associated with the larval stages sampled within these replanting blocks was determined by visual symptoms with subsequent verification with microbial analysis. The analysis was narrowed down to detect only bacteria (Bacillus thuringiensis and B. popillae), virus (Oryctes virus) and fungus (Metarhizium). In Block A, the population of O. rhinoceros in the trunks was reduced drastically at 14 months after replanting (MAR), which could be due to the high mortality (88%) of the third instar larvae, 3 months earlier. In Block B, the percentage mortality for the larval stage was always highest at the third instars (between 21-82%). In Block C however, the mortality of the third instars was low, never exceeding 35%. In these sampling blocks, the infection of Metarhizium seem to be less dominant compared to virus or bacteria The k factor analysis indicates density dependence among the third instar larvae had contributed to the change in its population density in Block A. Therefore, with proper manipulation of pheromone traps and targeted application of disease agents (i.e virus,fungus and bacteria), the population of O. rhinoceros can be managed more effectively in an oil palm replanting.","title":"The Effects of Mortality and Influence of Pheromone Trapping on the Infestation of Oryctes rhinoceros in an Oil Palm Plantation","creators":[{"firstName":"Norman","lastName":"Kamarudin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Mohd Basri","lastName":"Wahid","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ramle","lastName":"Moslim","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Siti Ramlah Ahmad","lastName":"Ali","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-10-18T00:48:17Z","dateModified":"2020-04-13T20:35:57Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/K74V55K8","itemID":1922,"attachments":[{"key":"6WWJTWP6","version":214,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Norman Hj Kamarudin et al. 2007.pdf","parentItem":"K74V55K8","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Norman Hj Kamarudin et al. 2007.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-10-18T00:48:53Z","dateModified":"2018-10-18T00:48:53Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/6WWJTWP6","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/6WWJTWP6/Norman Hj Kamarudin et al. 2007.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1933/Norman Hj Kamarudin et al. 2007.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303936,"version":0},"$loki":211},{"itemID":1170,"item":{"key":"KHP2U9UW","version":719,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.guaminsects.net/CRB/docs/Gries 1994 aggregation pheromone African rhinoceros beetle.pdf","volume":"49c","issue":"5-6","pages":"363-366","publicationTitle":"Verlag der Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung","date":"1994","extra":"Citation Key: gries_aggregation_1994","title":"Aggregation pheromone of the African rhinoceros beetle Oryctes monoceros (Oliver) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae)","creators":[{"firstName":"G","lastName":"Gries","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"R","lastName":"Gries","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"A.

The study used Randomized Block Design with 3 types of treatment and 10 times repetition on 10 larvae. The result of six weeks treatment showed that the highest larval mortality was obtained from the treatment with the mixture of MET and NEP. Biological control using two biological agents (MET and NEP) is better than only MET or NEP.

The main carbohydrate constituents of lignocellulosic material are cellulose and hemicelluloses (a group of heteropolymers that includes xylans and mannans). The most important process in bioethanol production from lignocellulose is the bioconversion of polysaccharides into fermentable sugar. Enzymatic hydrolysis has been developed because it is the more environmentally approach. Since the cost of hydrolytic enzyme production is the major problem of the process, many type of research has been focused on lowering the cost of enzyme production, including screening for organisms with a novel enzyme. This present study was conducted to isolate and screen of the cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic Bacteria from the gut of Oryctes rhinoceros L. larvae. The 3rd instars were used in this research. The research succeeded to isolate 11 bacterial isolates from the gut of O. rhinoceros larvae. The screening result demonstrated that bacterial isolates had cellulolytic (63.6% of total isolates), xylanolytic (72.7% of total isolates), and mannanolytic (100% of total isolates) activity. Based on the 16S rDNA sequence, 10 isolates were classified into Bacillus and only 1 isolate was classified into Citrobacter. The GOR2 which was closely related to Bacillus pumilus vit bac1 has the highest cellulolytic and xylanolytic activities.

The replication of three types of OrNV, the  types A, B, and C in the insect cell line DSIR-HA-1179 was studied. The cells were grown in PS100 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The signs of infection in cells by all types of OrNV were clearly seen at 10 to 14 days after treatment (DAT). The infected cells experienced cytopathic effects (CPE) involving formation of high number of vesicle or globule like-structures around the cells. The density of viable cells in flasks inoculated by the nudivirus decreased over time. At 16 DAT, the viable cell density in flasks inoculated with OrNV types A, B, and C was 1.49 × 105, 0.29 × 105, and 4.78 × 105 cells ml-1 respectively, significantly lower (P<0.05) compared to control flask of 7.98 × 105 cells ml-1. Based on the Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50% (TCID50), it was found that the OrNV type B was more virulent than the OrNV types A and C as it produced high infectious virus particles. The TCID50 values for the OrNV types A and C were 3.00 × 107 infectious unit (IU ml-1) and 8.03 x 105 IU ml-1 as compared to type B which was 7.09 × 107 IU ml-1. The PCR analysis showed that all types of OrNV had successfully replicated in the cells as early as 4 DAT. Pathogenicity study on neonates using cells-propagated OrNV has again showed that the OrNV type B was more pathogenic than the other types of OrNV. The LT50 value for the OrNV type B was 33.47 days, shorter than  the OrNV type A (49.35 days) and the OrNV type C (48.58 days). The DNA profiles of OrNV extracted from dead infected neonates in the bioassay were the same as those from infected gut tissues collected from field population. Thus, it is suggested that the Malaysian OrNV types A, B and C were successfully produced in cell line DSIR-HA-1179.","title":"REPLICATION OF Oryctes NUDIVIRUS (OrNV) IN INSECT CELL LINE DSIR-HA-1179 AND ITS INFECTIVITY ON NEONATES OF RHINOCEROS BEETLE, Oryctes rhinoceros","creators":[{"firstName":"Nur Ain Farhah Ros Saidon","lastName":"Khudri","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Wahizatul Afzan","lastName":"Azmi","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Norman","lastName":"Kamarudin","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Siti Ramlah Ahmad","lastName":"Ali","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ramle","lastName":"Moslim","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-10-09T22:43:29Z","dateModified":"2020-04-13T20:51:27Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/N2IBE8BH","itemID":1842,"attachments":[{"key":"VUJSW4XA","version":134,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Nur Ain Farhah Ros ---- et al 2016.pdf","parentItem":"N2IBE8BH","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Nur Ain Farhah Ros ---- et al 2016.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-10-09T22:45:59Z","dateModified":"2018-10-09T22:45:59Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/VUJSW4XA","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/VUJSW4XA/Nur Ain Farhah Ros ---- et al 2016.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1869/Nur Ain Farhah Ros ---- et al 2016.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303946,"version":0},"$loki":228},{"itemID":1852,"item":{"key":"N2WJRXRE","version":723,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"93","issue":"4","pages":"379-383","publicationTitle":"Journal of Plant Disease and Protection","date":"1985","extra":"Citation Key: mohan_diagnosis_1985","title":"Diagnosis of baculovirus infection in coconut rhinoceros beetles by examination of excreta","creators":[{"firstName":"K.

Knowledge of their breeding sites has been extended since a previous review in 1980. The fungus Metarhizium anisopliae has potential as a biopesticide against immature stages in friable breeding sites. The molecular biology and ultrastructure of Oryctes rhinoceros Nudivirus (OrNV), disseminated by adults, have been studied, and this pathogen can reduce O. rhinoceros populations and damage when introduced into new locations, especially where damage had been high. New PCR techniques may enable reliable quantification of dosages ingested and hence virulence of different isolates. Male-produced aggregation pheromones have been identified in several species, for which they may have management potential, having been used commercially for trapping O. rhinoceros in oil palm plantations in Southeast Asia, and tested against O. monoceros in Africa.","title":"Biology, Ecology, and Management of Palm Dynastid Beetles","creators":[{"firstName":"Geoffrey O.","lastName":"Bedford","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Metarhizium"},{"tag":"nudivirus"},{"tag":"oryctes"},{"tag":"palms"},{"tag":"pheromone"},{"tag":"scapanes"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/NNUGNVEV","itemID":1140,"attachments":[{"key":"FATP257T","version":11,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Bedford - 2013 - Biology and management of palm dynastid beetles recent advances","parentItem":"NNUGNVEV","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Bedford - 2013 - Biology and management of palm dynastid beetles recent advances.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/FATP257T","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/FATP257T/Bedford - 2013 - Biology and management of palm dynastid beetles recent advances.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1191/Bedford - 2013 - Biology and management of palm dynastid beetles recent advances.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303951,"version":0},"$loki":241},{"itemID":2364,"item":{"key":"NPAGUK2A","version":733,"itemType":"webpage","url":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/crbg07/","date":"2019-10-13","extra":"Citation Key: moore_facebook_2019","title":"FaceBook Site: CRB-G","creators":[{"firstName":"Aubrey","lastName":"Moore","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Ian R.","lastName":"Iriarte","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-13T04:40:17Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:25:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/NPAGUK2A","itemID":2364,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303951,"version":0},"$loki":242},{"itemID":1123,"item":{"key":"NQHUHZKR","version":715,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.scielo.br/pdf/ne/v36n2/a01v36n2.pdf","volume":"36","issue":"2","pages":"161-179","publicationTitle":"Neotropical Entomology","date":"2007","extra":"Citation Key: dolinski_microbial_2007","title":"Microbial control of arthropod pests of tropical tree fruits","creators":[{"firstName":"Claudia","lastName":"Dolinski","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Lawrence A","lastName":"Lacey","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:52Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/NQHUHZKR","itemID":1123,"attachments":[{"key":"5G4ZGBDU","version":5,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Dolinski, Lacey - 2007 - Microbial control of arthropod pests of tropical tree fruits","parentItem":"NQHUHZKR","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Dolinski, Lacey - 2007 - Microbial control of arthropod pests of tropical tree fruits.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/5G4ZGBDU","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/5G4ZGBDU/Dolinski, Lacey - 2007 - Microbial control of arthropod pests of tropical tree fruits.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1206/Dolinski, Lacey - 2007 - Microbial control of arthropod pests of tropical tree fruits.pdf"}],"notes":[{"key":"MJIWNTWS","version":3,"itemType":"note","parentItem":"NQHUHZKR","note":"<p>DNA analysis in Malaysia revealed several distinct viral genotypes with different virulences.

Pest populations were monitored by palm damage surveys for up to 4 yr on 22 islands, some of them deliberately untreated. The method used allowed estimates from a single survey of the number of beetle attacks during each of 18 mo (3rd–20th month before the survey date). Such surveys gave continuous records for O. rhinoceros attacks during 1983–1987. Most islands where the virus was released showed a highly significant reduction in palm damage. The prerelease pest density on a given island influenced the efficacy of the virus introduction. Adjustments were made for this effect when the performances of the different virus strains were compared. Strain X2B gave consistently better reduction in pest populations and more virus-infected beetles compared with strain V2/3B; the remaining strains gave intermediate control. These results agreed with earlier laboratory tests, in which the virulence of both strains was compared by infecting O. rhinoceros larvae. Two islands where three strains were released simultaneously also experienced a high damage reduction; here, X2B predominated eventually over strains V2/3B and S2A.","title":"Introduction and Field

The M. anisopliae infected all stages of Oryctes rhinoceros. At eight months after treatment (MAT), the application of product at rates of T1, 0.2 g (2.2 x 10 7 spores) and T2, 0.4 g (4.4 x 10 7 spores) m -2 heap was significantly reduced (P<0.05) the L2 and L3 larvae, pre-pupae and pupae. Reduction of these four stages has reduced the overall O. rhinoceros population in T1 to 30.8 individual per sampling plot (ISP) and T2 to 41.0 ISP, significant lower (P<0.05) as compared to population in the control (132.1 ISP). The growing of cover crops delayed the impact time of the fungus, but it provided protection to the fungus from the detrimental factors, giving favourable conditions to the spores to grow and initiate infection. Therefore, at eight MAT, as the population was significantly reduced, the infection levels were increased to 33.3% in T1 and 30.4% in T2, both were significantly higher (P<0.05) as compared to control (12.9%). Then it was further increased to 52.0% (control), 67.8% (T1) and 72.9% (T2) at 12 MAT. The use of the product at both rates did not affect the non-target insects.

This study investigated the impact of the different techniques of residue management in oil palm replanting to the abundance of O. rhinoceros. Two types of breeding sites, zero and partial burning were selected and the beetle populations were determined between three to 18 months after felling and chipping (MAF). At the sixth MAF, different stages of O. rhinoceros were collected from chipped trunks.  The results showed that a high population of O. rhinoceros was detected at the 13th MAF; no beetles were detected at the third, fourth and fifth MAF from both types of breeding sites. The third instar larvae were recorded as the dominant stage detected during the study. The females were found to be more abundant than the males, indicating better food quality and a potential for higher infestation for the coming months. There was no significant differences on the population of O. rhinoceros in both sites. The beetles population tended to increase with MAF. The results of this study suggested that the partial burning of chipped trunks did not decrease the population of O. rhinoceros apart from polluting the environment.","title":"POPULATION DYNAMICS OF

into Samoa in 1909 from where it spread to many islands in the south-west Paciﬁc. A novel virus pathogenic to the beetle, originally designated as Rhabdionvirus oryctes and later Oryctes virus, was isolated from Malaysia and introduced into Samoa in 1963. Later releases took place in Tonga, Fiji and other Paciﬁc Islands. The virus rapidly established and caused high levels of infection that spread as epizootics through the beetle populations. The virus killed larvae in breeding sites and caused adult beetles to cease feeding, leading to reduced damage and a decline in fecundity of the pest population. Researchers reported spectacular declines in the treated populations within 1–3 years of application. Reapplication has proven effective where there has been a resurgence of beetle damage. After 40 years from the initial releases, high palm damage has been reported from some areas suggesting a breakdown of control.

The beetles' habit of burrowing into breeding sites and into the coconut palm crown, together with the low value of the crop precludes the use of insecticides for control. Biological control agents must be able to penetrate these living places in order to be successful. The success of the Project is attrib- uted to the discovery and use of a baculovirus. Its success in reducing beetle numbers preceded the research on its ecology and safety and also curtailed other research direc- tions.

We detected OrNV infection in O. rhinoceros from Solomon Islands and used Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing to determine the full length of the virus genomic sequence isolated from an individual belonging to a mitochondrial lineage (CRB-G) that was previously reported as resistant to OrNV. The complete circular genome of the virus consisted of 125,917 nucleotides, 1.698 bp shorter than the originally-described full genome sequence of Ma07 strain from Malaysia. We found 130 out of 139 previously annotated ORFs (seven contained interrupted/non-coding sequences, two were identified as duplicated versions of the existing genes), as well as a putatively inverted regions containing four genes. These results demonstrate the usefulness of a long-read sequencing technology for resolving potential structural variations when describing new virus isolates. While the Solomon Islands isolate exhibited 99.41% nucleotide sequence identity with the originally described strain, we found several genes, including a core gene (vlf-1), that contained multiple amino acid insertions and/or deletions as putative polymorphisms of large effect. Our complete annotated genome sequence of a newly found isolate in Solomon Islands provides a valuable resource to help elucidate the mechanisms that compromise the efficacy of OrNV as a biocontrol agent against the coconut rhinoceros beetle.","title":"Complete genome sequence of Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus isolated from the coconut rhinoceros beetle in Solomon Islands","creators":[{"firstName":"Kayvan","lastName":"Etebari","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Igor","lastName":"Filipović","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gordana","lastName":"Rašić","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Gregor J.","lastName":"Devine","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Helen","lastName":"Tsatsia","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael J.","lastName":"Furlong","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Scarabaeidae","type":1},{"tag":"Coconut Rhinoceros Beetles","type":1},{"tag":"Genome","type":1},{"tag":"Oryctes nudivirus (species )","type":1},{"tag":"Oxford Nanopore","type":1},{"tag":"Solomon Islands","type":1},{"tag":"Technologies (ONT) sequencing","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2020-01-22T10:14:53Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:52Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/RENEQ9Z5","itemID":2490,"attachments":[{"key":"VFMVCYJR","version":689,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168170219308123?via%3Dihub","accessDate":"2020-01-22T10:14:55Z","title":"ScienceDirect Snapshot","parentItem":"RENEQ9Z5","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"S0168170219308123.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2020-01-22T10:14:55Z","dateModified":"2020-01-22T10:14:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/VFMVCYJR","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/VFMVCYJR/S0168170219308123.html","defaultPath":"files/2491/S0168170219308123.html"},{"key":"5A5ZVXXK","version":690,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/11/07/834036.full.pdf","accessDate":"2020-01-22T10:15:12Z","title":"Submitted Version","parentItem":"RENEQ9Z5","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Etebari et al. - 2020 - Complete genome sequence of Oryctes rhinoceros nud.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2020-01-22T10:15:12Z","dateModified":"2020-01-22T10:15:12Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/5A5ZVXXK","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/5A5ZVXXK/Etebari et al. - 2020 - Complete genome sequence of Oryctes rhinoceros nud.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2492/Etebari et al. - 2020 - Complete genome sequence of Oryctes rhinoceros nud.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303986,"version":0},"$loki":276},{"itemID":2403,"item":{"key":"RKVT9EF7","version":734,"itemType":"report","url":"https://github.com/aubreymoore/rearing3/raw/master/bioassay-V23BperOS.pdf","date":"2019","extra":"Citation Key: moore_bioassay_2019-5","institution":"University of Guam","title":"Bioassay Report: V23BperOS","creators":[{"firstName":"Aubrey","lastName":"Moore","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James J.","lastName":"Grasela","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-27T20:14:06Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:25:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/RKVT9EF7","itemID":2403,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303986,"version":0},"$loki":277},{"itemID":2401,"item":{"key":"RMTGKMG5","version":734,"itemType":"report","url":"https://github.com/aubreymoore/rearing3/raw/master/bioassay-V23B.pdf","date":"2019","extra":"Citation Key: moore_bioassay_2019-3","institution":"University of Guam","title":"Bioassay Report: V23B","creators":[{"firstName":"Aubrey","lastName":"Moore","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"James J.","lastName":"Grasela","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-27T20:09:29Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:25:00Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/RMTGKMG5","itemID":2401,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303986,"version":0},"$loki":278},{"itemID":2517,"item":{"key":"RSZ35IJC","version":1026,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"20:957","publicationTitle":"BMC Genomics","date":"2019-12","extra":"Citation Key: shelomi_transcriptome_2019","abstractNote":"Background: The coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros, is a major pest of palm crops in tropical Asia and the Pacific Islands. Little molecular data exists for this pest, impeding our ability to develop effective countermeasures and deal with the species’ growing resistance to viral biocontrols. We present the first molecular biology analyses of this species, including a metagenomic assay to understand the microbiome of different sections of its digestive tract, and a transcriptomics assay to complement the microbiome data and to shed light on genes of interest like plant cell wall degrading enzymes and immunity and xenobiotic resistance genes. Results: The gut microbiota of Oryctes rhinoceros larvae is quite similar to that of the termite gut, as both species feed on decaying wood. We found the first evidence for endogenous beta-1,4-endoglucanase in the beetle, plus evidence for microbial cellobiase, suggesting the beetle can degrade cellulose together with its gut microfauna. A number of antimicrobial peptides are expressed, particularly by the fat body but also by the midgut and hindgut. Conclusions: This transcriptome provides a wealth of data about the species’ defense against chemical and biological threats, has uncovered several potentially new species of microbial symbionts, and significantly expands our knowledge about this pest.

Signs and symptoms of this so-called “Malaya disease” are described. In diseased larvae, the fat body is greatly disintegrated. Fat cells often show a striking proliferative response to virus infection. By differential centrifugation of suspensions of homogenized affected fat-body lobes, spherical viral particles with mostly polygonal contours and an average diameter of 164 ± 16 mμ could be isolated together with a comparatively low number of virus rods measuring about 200 × 70 mμ. These viral sediments proved highly infective for larvae when inoculated into the body cavity. The same was the case with filtrates of homogenized fat body of diseased larvae when filters with a mean pore size of 1 micron, 600 mμ, and 300 mμ were used. Injection of filtrates passed through 100-mμ-pore filters had no apparent effect on the larvae, yet the emerging adults were crippled.\n\nUltrathin sections revealed that the nuclei of fat-body cells are the principal sites of virus reproduction, yet repeatedly virogenic foci could also be observed in the cytoplasm. In an advanced stage of cell infection the hypertrophied nuclei contain crowds of singleor double-membraned spherical viral particles (shells), most of them ranging in diameter from 120 to 230 mμ (mean 160 mμ), and, closely associated with them, masses of virus rods with a length predominantly ranging from 170 to 210 mμ (mean 195 mμ) and an average width of 70 mμ. Both components are identical with the isolated spheres and rods. The virus rods, being the mature form of the virus, have a highly differentiated structure. They are established (1) from dense, chromatinlike virogenic stroma, (2) from loose, fibrillar and granular stromal material, (3) from filaments, and (4) from inside of the single- or double-membraned spherical particles (shells). Thus, the spheres represent viral developmental stages. The virus rods are not occluded in polyhedra or capsules of microcrystalline proteinaceous material. Yet clusters of rods may be densely packed in a two- or three-dimensional pseudocrystalline pattern.\n\nThe disease is easily transmissible to third-instar larvae by contaminated food as well as by intrahemocoelic inoculation. The period of lethal infection is from about 6 to 30 days. Peroral and intrahemocoelic transmission of the disease to larvae of Oryctes nasicornis (Linnaeus) also is easily effected.\n\nThe virus cannot be classed with any known group of insect viruses. Accordingly, it is placed in a new genus for which the generic name Rhabdionvirus gen.n. is proposed. The type species of this new genus (the virus under discussion) is named Rhabdionvirus oryctes gen. n., sp. n.","title":"A virus disease of the Indian rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros (linnaeus), caused by a new type of insect virus, Rhabdionvirus oryctes gen. n., sp. n","creators":[{"firstName":"","lastName":"Alois M.Huger","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-11-01T01:46:02Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/RXR3B6QQ","itemID":1962,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303987,"version":0},"$loki":280},{"itemID":2416,"item":{"key":"S7Z5Z7W9","version":735,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"2","issue":"8","pages":"188-194","publicationTitle":"European International Journal of Science and Technology","date":"2013","extra":"Citation Key: s._p._jayawardena_effective_2013-1","abstractNote":"This research was carried out to determine the effective inoculation method and optimum\nconcentration of local Oryctes virus (OrV) for successful infection of Oryctes rhinoceros (L.) adults in\nlaboratory which released to the field to spread the viral disease among healthy larvae and beetles.\nPercentage of infected beetles were significantly different (P<0.001) among the two methods of inoculation\nand untreated control.

Likewise, host behavioural\nchanges can be a defence mechanism, counteracting the impact of pathogens on host fitness. We apply harmonic radar\ntechnology to characterize the impact of an emerging pathogen - Nosema ceranae (Microsporidia) - on honeybee (Apis\nmellifera) flight and orientation performance in the field. Honeybees are the most important commercial pollinators.\nEmerging diseases have been proposed to play a prominent role in colony decline, partly through sub-lethal behavioural\nmanipulation of their hosts. We found that homing success was significantly reduced in diseased (65.8%) versus healthy\nforagers (92.5%). Although lost bees had significantly reduced continuous flight times and prolonged resting times, other\nflight characteristics and navigational abilities showed no significant difference between infected and non-infected bees.\nOur results suggest that infected bees express normal flight characteristics but are constrained in their homing ability,\npotentially compromising the colony by reducing its resource inputs, but also counteracting the intra-colony spread of infection. We provide the first high-resolution analysis of sub-lethal effects of an emerging disease on insect flight behaviour. The potential causes and the implications for both host and parasite are discussed.","title":"So Near and Yet So Far: Harmonic Radar Reveals Reduced Homing Ability of Nosema Infected Honeybees","creators":[{"firstName":"Dino P.

This species was detected attacking coconut palms on Oʻahu, Hawaiʻi in December 2013, and an eradication program was initiated. One of the major challenges for eradication has been the identification of new breeding sites. Information on the factors influencing oviposition is needed to aid in finding sites likely to host the immature stages of this insect. In this study, a series of choice tests were conducted to assess the oviposition preferences of both laboratory-reared and wild-caught CRB. Mated females, of both lab-reared and wild-caught beetles, were offered for oviposition a choice between sand and two mulch substrates, one with small and one with large particle sizes. Both types of CRB laid eggs preferentially in substrate of small particle size rather than large and none laid eggs in sand. Labreared and wild-caught CRB differed in their oviposition behavior and size. These results can be used to aid in the identification of breeding sites for management programs and eradication efforts.","title":"Oviposition Preferences and Behavior of Wild-Caught and Laboratory-Reared Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), in Relation to Substrate Particle Size","creators":[{"firstName":"Megan","lastName":"Manley","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael J.","lastName":"Melzer","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Helen","lastName":"Spafford","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-26T05:53:25Z","dateModified":"2020-03-12T07:05:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/TIUKXEAR","itemID":1995,"attachments":[{"key":"RHVETQMT","version":295,"itemType":"attachment","title":"insects-09-00141.pdf","parentItem":"TIUKXEAR","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"insects-09-00141.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2018-12-26T05:54:44Z","dateModified":"2018-12-26T05:54:44Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/RHVETQMT","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/RHVETQMT/insects-09-00141.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2000/insects-09-00141.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186303999,"version":0},"$loki":303},{"itemID":2381,"item":{"key":"TRP9C7AZ","version":733,"itemType":"report","extra":"Citation Key: noauthor_notitle_nodate","creators":[],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T21:34:28Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:25:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/TRP9C7AZ","itemID":2381,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186304000,"version":0},"$loki":304},{"itemID":1917,"item":{"key":"TUDUGAR6","version":724,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"21","issue":"2","publicationTitle":"Journal Ent. Soc. S. Africa","date":"1958","extra":"Citation Key: f._l._vanderplank_assassin_1958","abstractNote":"The rhinoceros beetles Oryctes boas (F.) and O. monoceros (Oliv.) do serious damage to coconut palms in Zanzibar and East Africa. These beetles breed in decaying wood, particularly decaying palm trunks, and in manure and compost heaps. They lay their eggs in the decaying vegetable matter, often boring well inside to do so. The eggs, white and the size of mustard seeds, hatch in 7 to 9 days. The larvae take between one hundred and two hundred days to reach maturity according to temperature and availability of food; and the pupal stage lasts from 14 to 21 days. Damage is caused by the adult beetles since they bore into the growing tip of the palm: in some cases this kills the palm, particularly if it is a young one, but generally it causes a considerable reduction in leaf area and distortion of the palm. Mansfield-Aders (1920) reports that Oryctes spp. caused serious damage in Zanzibar and that no insect parasites had been found. During the nineteen thirties it was discovered that the scolliid wasp Scalia ruficornis F. was a parasite on the larvae of Oryctes spp. and was considered to exercise considerable control of Oryctes spp. in Zanzibar, although there were no data to support this. Surveys of the numbers of Oryctes larvae parasitized by S. ruficornis have only shown about 10 maximal parasitism and it is doubtful whether this would be sufficient to keep the beetle in check. Agriculture hygiene, such as burying all decaying logs and vegetation, has done a great deal to check the pest. Scolliid wasps have been collected in Zanzibar by several people and, in some cases, introduced with great success in other parts of the world. Recently Dr. Dun of Kew Guinea collected scolliids here and he informs me that these are now well established near Keravat, New Guinea. Although the scolliid wasp has been successful in controlling Oryctes in other countries where it has been introduced I did not feel satisfied that it was solely responsible for the high degree of natural control prevailing here in Zanzibar. In one coconut plantation the Department of Agriculture havc large compost heaps. These heaps breed numerous Oryctes spp. and counts on various occasions have indicated that under 10 % of these are parasitized by S. rujlcornis. Since numerous pupae and freshly emerged adults of Oryctes spp. can generally be found in these heaps, it would be natural to expect a high rate of Oryctes damage in the surrounding coconut palms. In actual fact, there appears less Oryctes damage in this plantation than elsewhere, where there are no compost heaps breeding Oryctes. While examining the crowns of the palms in this area for Pseudotheraptus damage, I was astonished by the numbers of dead Oryctes adults that were present in the debris that collects in the axils of the leaves, and also very painfully made aware of the presence of the assassin bug Platymerus rhadamanthus Gerst. hiding in this debris. Most of the dead Oryctes spp. were merely hollow exoskeletons, and each one had a sizeable hole in the intersegmental membrane between the head and the thorax. In what appeared freshly killed specimens small ants such as Plagiolepis brunni Mayr, Crematogaster nr rectinota For., Semonius schultzei For., Cardiocondyla wroughtoni For. and Tapinoma luleus Em. were often observed cleaning the inside of the dead beetle through this hole. It seemed that there might be some connection between the assassin bug P. rhadamanthus and these dead Oryctes spp., so several living adult P. rhudamanthus were captured and male and female Oryctes sp. were offered for food. It was observed that P. rhadamanthus immediately seized and pierced Oryctes by inserting its proboscis in the intersegmental membrane between the head and the thorax. The beetles ceased to struggle after 15 to 20 seconds and the assassin bug spent two or three hours feeding on the dead Orytes. Examination of these dead Oryctes failed to show any obvious \"hole\" where P. rlwdamanthus had fed; the puncture was, no doubt, enlarged later by one of the ant species previously mentioned. Following the above observations further work was undertaken on P. rhadamanthus. During July 1957 Dr. P. Surany of the South Pacific High Commission visited Zanzibar and searched for the presence of fungous and virus diseases of Oryctes larvae. He is of the opinion that a large percentage of the Oryctes larvae are infected, and that virus and fungous diseases cause a high mortality amongst the larvae. Nevertheless, from an examination of compost heaps and rotting logs it was concluded that a considerable number of adults must l,ave emerged.","title":"The assassin bug) Platymerus rhadamanthus Gerst (Hemiptera: Reduviidae») a useful predator of the rhinoceros beetles Oryctes boas (F.) and Oryctes monoceros (Oliv.).

Surprisingly, a highly damaging outbreak was reported from Guam (2007), which could not be controlled by OrNV. Subsequently, new invasions have been reported from Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea (2009); O’ahu, Hawai’i (2013); and Honiara, Solomon Islands (2015). We have found that all of these outbreaks have been caused by a previously unrecognized haplotype, CRB-G, which appears to be tolerant to OrNV. PCR analysis shows that OrNV is generally present at high incidence in established populations of CRB, but is generally absent from the invasive CRB-G populations. CRB-G from Guam was not susceptible to OrNV infection by oral delivery, but injection of the virus did cause mortality. Further genetic analysis shows that CRB populations can be divided into a number of clades that coincide with the endemic and invasive history of the beetle. Analysis suggests that CRB-G originated in Asia, though the precise location remains to be discovered.","title":"A new haplotype of the coconut rhinoceros beetle, <i>Oryctes rhinoceros</i>, has escaped biological control by <i>Oryctes rhinoceros</i> nudivirus and is invading Pacific Islands","creators":[{"firstName":"Sean D.

The RPW is a palm borer insect that develops within the soft tissues of the trunk and crown, eventually leading to tree death. Early detection of RPW infestation is crucial because,at an early stage of infestation,palms can be treated more efﬁciently and saved,while the determination of treatment efﬁcacy is hugely vital to optimize palm rescue efforts. Detection is often particularly problematic since not all palms can be accessed and inspected directly. Thermography technique can determine the thermal properties of any objects of interest, and it is a non-destructive. In thermography, the invisible radiation patternsaretransformedtovisibleimagescalledthermalimages.Thosethermalimages are acquired using speciﬁc sensors that can be coupled with many available optical systems. Due to the simple operating procedure and the noticeable reductions in equipment cost of thermal imaging systems, it gains popularity in pests’ detection. This chapter discusses the state-of-the-art research concerning the detection methods for detecting infected Palm trees.The study will concentrate on the thermal imaging and its application on red palm weevil detection.","title":"Detection of Palm Tree Pests Using Thermal Imaging: A Review","bookTitle":"Machine Learning Paradigms: Theory and Application, Studies in Computational Intelligence","creators":[{"firstName":"Abdelhameed Ibrahim","lastName":"Ali Ahmed","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"","lastName":"Sherif Hussein","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-09T01:57:35Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/WMAEHGUH","itemID":2009,"attachments":[{"key":"7Z9BAPX8","version":300,"itemType":"attachment","title":"10.1007978-3-030-02357-712.pdf","parentItem":"WMAEHGUH","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"10.1007978-3-030-02357-712.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-01-09T01:58:07Z","dateModified":"2019-01-09T01:58:07Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/7Z9BAPX8","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/7Z9BAPX8/10.1007978-3-030-02357-712.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2010/10.1007978-3-030-02357-712.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186304018,"version":0},"$loki":337},{"itemID":1074,"item":{"key":"WMTH28IS","version":833,"itemType":"report","url":"https://github.com/aubreymoore/miscellaneous-files/blob/master/APHIS-biocontrol-final-report-December2015.pdf","date":"2015","extra":"Citation Key: moore_final_2015","title":"Final Report for USDA-APHIS Biocontrol Project 13-8515-1555-CA: Efficacy of Entomopathogenic Fungus for Biological Control of Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle (CRB) on Guam and DNA Profiling of Asia/Pacific CRB Populations with Respect to Virus Susceptibility","creators":[{"firstName":"Aubrey","lastName":"Moore","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Sean","lastName":"Marshall","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Metarhizium"},{"tag":"OrNV"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-23T02:07:58Z","dateModified":"2020-03-20T20:49:50Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/WMTH28IS","itemID":1074,"attachments":[{"key":"8HDN2EXF","version":72,"itemType":"attachment","title":"APHIS-biocontrol-final-report-December2015.pdf","parentItem":"WMTH28IS","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"APHIS-biocontrol-final-report-December2015.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-23T02:17:01Z","dateModified":"2016-04-23T02:17:01Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/8HDN2EXF","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/8HDN2EXF/APHIS-biocontrol-final-report-December2015.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1230/APHIS-biocontrol-final-report-December2015.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186304018,"version":0},"$loki":338},{"itemID":2099,"item":{"key":"WNAHWXB3","version":727,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"38","issue":"1","pages":"168-175","publicationTitle":"Environ.

Knowledge of their breeding sites has been extended since a previous review in 1980. The fungus Metarhizium anisopliae has potential as a biopesticide against immature stages in friable breeding sites. The molecular biology and ultrastructure of Oryctes rhinoceros Nudivirus (OrNV), disseminated by adults, have been studied, and this pathogen can reduce O. rhinoceros populations and damage when introduced into new locations, especially where damage had been high. New PCR techniques may enable reliable quantification of dosages ingested and hence virulence of different isolates. Male-produced aggregation pheromones have been identified in several species, for which they may have management potential, having been used commercially for trapping O. rhinoceros in oil palm plantations in Southeast Asia, and tested against O. monoceros in Africa.","title":"Biology and management of palm dynastid beetles: recent advances.","creators":[{"firstName":"Geoffrey O","lastName":"Bedford","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"animals"},{"tag":"Arecaceae"},{"tag":"Beetles"},{"tag":"Beetles: microbiology"},{"tag":"Beetles: physiology"},{"tag":"Beetles: virology"},{"tag":"DNA Viruses"},{"tag":"DNA Viruses: physiology"},{"tag":"Herbivory"},{"tag":"insect control"},{"tag":"Insect Control: methods"},{"tag":"Metarhizium"},{"tag":"Metarhizium: physiology"},{"tag":"nudivirus"},{"tag":"oryctes"},{"tag":"palms"},{"tag":"pheromone"},{"tag":"Pheromones"},{"tag":"Pheromones: metabolism"},{"tag":"scapanes"},{"tag":"Species Specificity"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:24:51Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/XD9ZUM5P","itemID":1141,"attachments":[{"key":"N6Q2UMTE","version":12,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Bedford - 2013 - Biology and Management of Palm Dynastid Beetles Recent Advances","parentItem":"XD9ZUM5P","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Bedford - 2013 - Biology and Management of Palm Dynastid Beetles Recent Advances.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/N6Q2UMTE","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/N6Q2UMTE/Bedford - 2013 - Biology and Management of Palm Dynastid Beetles Recent Advances.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1276/Bedford - 2013 - Biology and Management of Palm Dynastid Beetles Recent Advances.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186304023,"version":0},"$loki":346},{"itemID":1157,"item":{"key":"XF9NR8GE","version":718,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-80052496547&partnerID=40&md5=ea08e15dd7c255af47f96716f30ef73c","volume":"104","issue":"5","pages":"919-927","publicationTitle":"Annals of the Entomological Society of America","date":"2011","extra":"Citation Key: puker_notes_2011","DOI":"10.1603/AN10197","abstractNote":"Dynastinae beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) are important due to their role in recycling plant material and promoting nutrient turnover. However, some species are phytophagous and can attack crop plants, thus becoming pests. Here, we provide information on the biology and behavior of the rhinoceros beetle Enema pan (F.) (Oryctini), an abundant species in the area of Cerrado-Pantanal ecotone, Aquidauana, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Adults were collected with a light trap deployed daily from January 2006 to December 2007 in the experimental farm of the Universidade Estadual de Mato Grosso do Sul (Aquidauana campus). Adults were maintained in plastic containers and observations were made daily. Temporal distribution of adults of E. pan occurred in September and October (2006) and from October to December (2007). Flight started at 1930 hours and ended at 2330 hours. Twenty-four eggs (3.28 mm in length by 2.32 mm in width) with a whitish color were ovipositioned directly in to the soil. Adult longevity averaged 22.0 d in the laboratory conditions. Cephalic horn length, body length, and width of E. pan males are greater than those of females. The weight of adults of both sexes was similar. Cephalic horn length of the males of E. pan was positively correlated with his body size. Mating occurred between 0800 and 1030 hours and lasted on average 18.1 min in the laboratory. Several fights among males and other behaviors involving males and females were observed and are reported. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.","title":"Notes on biology and behavior of rhinoceros beetle enema pan (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Dynastinae)","creators":[{"firstName":"A","lastName":"Puker","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"S R","lastName":"Rodrigues","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"E F","lastName":"Tiago","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"S","lastName":"Ide","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"J","lastName":"Fuhrmann","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Oryctes rhinoceros"},{"tag":"Coleoptera"},{"tag":"Scarabaeidae"},{"tag":"adult"},{"tag":"allometry"},{"tag":"beetle"},{"tag":"behavioral ecology"},{"tag":"Brazil"},{"tag":"color"},{"tag":"crop pest"},{"tag":"crop plant"},{"tag":"Dynastinae"},{"tag":"ecotone"},{"tag":"laboratory method"},{"tag":"longevity"},{"tag":"Mato Grosso do Sul"},{"tag":"Oryctini"},{"tag":"oviposition"},{"tag":"Pirapo River"},{"tag":"Pleurosticti"},{"tag":"sexual selection"},{"tag":"turnover"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:25:02Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/XF9NR8GE","itemID":1157,"attachments":[{"key":"QT6TB2F6","version":12,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Puker 2011","parentItem":"XF9NR8GE","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Puker 2011.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/QT6TB2F6","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/QT6TB2F6/Puker 2011.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1284/Puker 2011.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186304024,"version":0},"$loki":347},{"itemID":2382,"item":{"key":"XGMPY39X","version":733,"itemType":"report","extra":"Citation Key: noauthor_notitle_nodate-1","creators":[],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-10-19T21:34:36Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:25:06Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/XGMPY39X","itemID":2382,"attachments":[],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186304024,"version":0},"$loki":348},{"itemID":1130,"item":{"key":"XGNNGIT7","version":715,"itemType":"journalArticle","volume":"9","issue":"3","pages":"783-797","date":"1972","extra":"Citation Key: davidson_environmental_1972","title":"Environmental Stress in the Pasture Scarab Sericesthis nigrolineata Boisd .

CRB is a major pest of coconut palm trees (Cocos nucifera) in its expanded range which includes tropical islands in the Pacific, and \nmost recently the island of Oahu in the Hawaiian archipelago. For decades a double-stranded DNA virus, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV; family \nNudiviridae, genus Alphanudivirus), has been an effective biological control agent reducing the impact of CRB in its native and expanded range.

The  purpose  of  this  study  is to  determine  whether  OrNV  is \npresent in Oahu’s incipient CRB population, as its presence may positively impact eradication efforts. To date, 21 field-caught CRB specimens have \nbeen assayed for OrNV using a PCR-based assay, all of which have been determined to be negative for the virus. This suggests that OrNV did not \naccompany CRB during its invasion of Oahu, and/or CRB on Oahu are resistant to the virus. We also assayed CRB specimens from several locations \nin Southeast Asia and Pacific Islands for the presence of OrNV and examined the genetic diversity of the virus within a 945 bp region of the gene \ncoding  for  the  gp83-like  protein. OrNV  could  be  found  in  all  locations  from  which  specimens  were  collected,  with  the  island  of Guam  being  an \nexception.

Larval breeding sites more frequently contained ROV-infected insects if the sites were occupied by two broods instead of one and if there was a high density of breeding in the area. Females infected with ROV visited the breeding sites less frequently for egg-laying than healthy females. The male adults, as they increased in age, were found to be more frequently infected with ROV, but the young female adults were more frequently infected than very young or old females.

The beetle can cause great economic losses, not only to agriculture but also due to indirect impacts on tropical aesthetics and tourism. In the last decade, new invasive populations of the beetle have been detected on Guam and Oahu, Hawaii. Despite the beetle’s extensive invasion history and economic impacts, little is known about its invasion dynamics. We used 1,480 base pairs of cytochrome oxidase subunit I mitochondrial and 814 base pairs of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamoylase, dihydroorotase nuclear DNA to conduct a population genetics analysis on eight beetle populations from Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, and China in the beetle’s native range and Palau, American Samoa, Guam, and Hawaii in the beetle’s invasive range, in an attempt to resolve invasion pathways. Genetic diversity was insufficient to generate strong evidence for O. rhinoceros movement patterns. Mitochondrial DNA provided a clear but poorly supported population structure. Although nuclear DNA proved to be more diverse, population structure lacked clear signal. This lack of diversity is congruent with a rapid, recent invasion. There appears to be no genetic exchange between populations once they establish, implying that they are rare, human-mediated dispersal events.","title":"Low Variation in Nuclear and Mitochondrial DNA Inhibits Resolution of Invasion Pathways across the Pacific for the Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle (Scarabaeidae: Oryctes rhinoceros)","creators":[{"firstName":"J Bradley","lastName":"Reil","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Michael San","lastName":"Jose","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Rubinoff","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-05-28T04:39:55Z","dateModified":"2020-03-04T17:51:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/ZKX7KX37","itemID":2228,"attachments":[{"key":"G86D4WH3","version":393,"itemType":"attachment","url":"https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/42750/1/PHES48_57-69.pdf","accessDate":"2018-04-06T05:44:45Z","title":"Reil et al. - Low Variation in Nuclear and Mitochondrial DNA Inh.pdf","parentItem":"ZKX7KX37","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Reil et al. - Low Variation in Nuclear and Mitochondrial DNA Inh.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2019-05-28T04:39:55Z","dateModified":"2019-05-28T04:39:55Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/G86D4WH3","localPath":"/home/aubrey/Zotero/storage/G86D4WH3/Reil et al. - Low Variation in Nuclear and Mitochondrial DNA Inh.pdf","defaultPath":"files/2229/Reil et al. - Low Variation in Nuclear and Mitochondrial DNA Inh.pdf"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1589186304039,"version":0},"$loki":373},{"itemID":1096,"item":{"key":"ZT92GAAI","version":712,"itemType":"journalArticle","url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16039309","volume":"89","issue":"1","pages":"85-90","publicationTitle":"Journal of invertebrate pathology","date":"May 2005","extra":"Citation Key: ramle_incidence_2005","DOI":"10.1016/j.jip.2005.02.009","abstractNote":"The rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros, has emerged as a serious pest of oil palm since the prohibition of burning as a method for maintaining estate hygiene in the 1990s. The abundance of beetles is surprising given that the Malay peninsula was the site of first discovery of the Oryctes virus, which has been used to effect good as a biological control agent in other regions. A survey of adult beetles was carried out throughout Malaysia using pheromone traps. Captured beetles were examined for presence of virus using both visual/microscopic examination and PCR detection methods. The survey indicated that Oryctes virus was common in Malaysia among the adult beetles. Viral DNA analysis was carried out after restriction with HindIII enzyme and indicated at least three distinct viral genotypes. Bioassays were used to compare the viral strains and demonstrate that one strain (type B) is the most virulent against both larvae and adults of the beetle. Virus type B has been cultured and released into healthy populations where another strain (type A) forms the natural background. Capture and examination of beetles from the release site and surrounding area has shown that the spread and persistence of the applied virus strain is accompanied by a reduction in palm frond damage.","title":"The incidence and use of Oryctes virus for control of rhinoceros beetle in oil palm plantations in Malaysia.","creators":[{"firstName":"M","lastName":"Ramle","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"M B","lastName":"Wahid","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"K","lastName":"Norman","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"T R","lastName":"Glare","creatorType":"author"},{"firstName":"Trevor A","lastName":"Jackson","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"animals"},{"tag":"Beetles"},{"tag":"Beetles: virology"},{"tag":"Baculoviridae"},{"tag":"Baculoviridae: classification"},{"tag":"Baculoviridae: genetics"},{"tag":"Baculoviridae: pathogenicity"},{"tag":"Biological"},{"tag":"coco"},{"tag":"DNA"},{"tag":"Incidence"},{"tag":"Malaysia"},{"tag":"pest control"},{"tag":"Plant Oils"},{"tag":"Trees"},{"tag":"Trees: parasitology"},{"tag":"Viral"},{"tag":"Virus Diseases"},{"tag":"Virus Diseases: epidemiology"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2016-04-12T06:55:49Z","dateModified":"2020-01-27T00:25:03Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/groups/511387/items/ZT92GAAI","itemID":1096,"attachments":[{"key":"ZZ2T6N7E","version":13,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Ramle -
