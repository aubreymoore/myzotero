Description and figures
This report describes a C++ code to fit the Logistic model to the daily total cases reported by data sources of the COVID-19 outbreak using least-squares. Some examples for China, Brazil, India and Italy are tested numerically and the code listing is given. The method can be used to "track" the daily evolution of new cases and to make predictions about the time of maximum daily cases as well as the total number of cases at the end of the pandemic.
