Where is Guam?

This map shows the tracks of all Tropical cyclones which formed worldwide from 1985 to 2005.

Ungulates

Loss of native forest Few young trees survive intensive browsing
Before deer and pig fence erected March 2004 (NW Field AAFB) 22 months after deer and pigs excluded January 2006

Major Animal Invaders of Guam's Forests
● Ungulates: deer, pigs, caribao ● Brown treesnake ● Asian Cycad Scale and Associates ● Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle ● Little Fire Ant

There are no native snakes in Guam, CNMI, FSM, Marshall Islands and Hawaii

• BTS arrived on
Guam accidentally in late 1940’s to early 1950’s
• Nocturnal
• Tree dwelling

• Mildly venomous
• Avg. size = 4.5 ft.
• High snake densities (up to 45 per acre)

Effects of Brown treesnake on Guam's Forests
●Loss of ecosystem services provided by birds and other BTS prey: ●Seed dispersal ●Pollination ●Insectivory

Possible Example of Forest Damage Due to Bird Loss: Katydid egg scars on sapling leaders
Damage to Serianthes nelsonii leaders.

Decline of Cycas micronesica Following Infestation by Aulacaspis yasumatsui

●First detected on ornamental plant in November 2003
●Escapes to wild cycads within 1 year
●Placed on IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in 2006
●Only 7% of plants have survived and no reproduction has been seen since 2005

Little Fire Ant, Wasmannia auropunctata

Little Fire Ant, Wasmannia auropunctata
●Detected November 2011 ●Currently at >12 locations ●No control work has been done to date ●Probable effects in infested areas:
● Most other animals will be extirpated from infested areas
● Damage from honey dew producing hemipteran populations will increase
● Agricultural and recreational activities will be curtailed

Other Animal Invaders of Concern
● Termites ● Hemipterans ● Bark beetles ● Erythrina gall wasp ● Casuarina gall wasp ● Snails and slugs

Bark Beetles, Scolytidae
New records of bark beetles from a single coffee berry borer trap operated by Aubrey Moore at the University of Guam Yigo Agricultural Experiment Station, January through February, 2011. Species determined by Donald Bright, Colorado State University. The trap caught seven species of scolytids, four of which are new island records: 1. Coccotrypes advena Blandford 2. Hypothemus burmanus (Eicho) 3. Hypothemus crudiae (Panzer) 4. Xylosandrus crassiusculus (Motschulsky)

Other Animal Invaders of Concern
● Termites ● Hemipterans ● Bark beetles ● Erythrina gall wasp ● Casuarina gall wasp ● Snails and slugs

Erythrina Gall Wasp, Quadristichus erythrinae
Not a serious problem on Guam.
No endemic Erythrina. Erythrina variegata is the larval host for the fruit piercing moth, Eudocima phalonia, which is a major agricultural pest.

Other Animal Invaders of Concern
● Termites ● Hemipterans ● Bark beetles ● Erythrina gall wasp ● Casuarina gall wasp ● Snails and slugs

Casuarina Gall Wasp, Selitrichodes casuarinae La Salle 2014

Other Animal Invaders of Concern
● Termites ● Hemipterans ● Bark beetles ● Erythrina gall wasp ● Casuarina gall wasp ● Snails and slugs

Cuban Slug, Veronicella cubensis
●Time lapse videos made with a trail cam equipped with an infrared flash reveal high nocturnal activity of Cuban slugs, snails, and greenhouse frogs on the limestone forest floor. ●Possibly, the slugs are doing major damage to seedlings.

Recurring Themes
● Tropical islands are susceptible to biological invasions. ● Globalization, air transport, and lax biosecurity have
negated benefits of geographical isolation. ● Smaller islands are more susceptible to damage from
invasive species than larger islands. Larger islands usually have a larger guild of predators and parasites. ● Damage done by invasive species is unpredictable – depends on pre-existing conditions. (Cycad scale a minor problem in HI but a major problem in the Marianas; erythrina gall wasp a major problem in HI, minor problem in the Marianas). ● There is almost always a need for some applied research.

Impediments to Responding to Invasive Species in Micronesia
● Lack of professional capacity: Only 3 PhD level entomologists and 1 PhD level plant pathologist are active in Micronesia. Down from 9 and 3 respectively.
● Detection rates have increased by an order of magnitude. Currently 1 new island record per month.
● There is no emergency funding for rapid response.

Invasive species aren’t all bad. They provide job security for biologists.
