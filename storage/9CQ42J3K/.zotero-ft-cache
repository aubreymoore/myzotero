I am calling an API that returns JSON data. I am using json.loads to decode the JSON to Python as a dictionary. The dictionary that returns is a somewhat complex nested dictonary with nested lists as well.

For example:

 { "educations" : { "_total" : 1 , "values" : [{ "degree" : "Bachelor of Arts" , "fieldOfStudy" : "Psychology" , "schoolName" : "Antioch University Seattle" }] }  

How do I store each of the values into an SQLite database with the model defined as:

 class Educations ( models . Model ): name = models . ForeignKey ( Candidate ) degree = models . CharField ( max_length = 200 ) fieldOfStudy = models . CharField ( max_length = 200 ) schoolName = models . CharField ( max_length = 200 )  

Each education is associated with a Candidate which is defined in the Candidate class (not shown here).

I am just learning Python / Django. I have spent the past few days trying to figure this out.

You can set the fields in new object like

 # Get after json.dump json_data = { "educations" : { "_total" : 1 , "values" : [{ "degree" : "Bachelor of Arts" , "fieldOfStudy" : "Psychology" , "schoolName" : "Antioch University Seattle" }] } for each_education in json_data [ 'educations' ][ 'values' ] new_education = Education (** each_education ) # Set the name foreign key # new_educaiton.name = name new_education . save ()  

Note: How you will get the data for the name foreignkey is not mention in your question so that also you can set.

I'm sorry - for my understanding is this what is going on? (1) get json_data using json.dump (2) define variable each_education to loop through every value under the "value" key under the "educations" key (#) (3) map new_education variable to save to the class Educations (4) save new_educations to database with new_education.save() Is this logic correct? –  Hung Luu Mar 22 '12 at 17:08
   	 
	
yes try your code and if get error then past that error so we can solve that :) –  Lafada Mar 23 '12 at 15:49

Thanks Lafada - I think your answer works but the structure of the JSON that I am returning has more levels under [education] and [values] that I don't think the **each_education argument worked. I had to individually call each value in the dictionary that i wanted and then saved it like you did. I was able to get it to work though after you pointed me to the right direction! thank you. –  Hung Luu Mar 23 '12 at 18:23
   	 
	
That is up to you how you structure data. –  Lafada Mar 24 '12 at 7:29

    In most cases, a plain URL will be recognized as such and automatically linked:

     Visit http://area51.stackexchange.com/ regularly!
    Use angle brackets to force linking: Have you seen <http://superuser.com>?

    To create fancier links, use Markdown:

     Here's [a link](http://www.example.com/)! And a reference-style link to [a panda][1].
    References don't have to be [numbers][question].

     [1]: http://notfound.stackexchange.com/
     [question]: http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/11481

    You can add tooltips to links:

     Click [here](http://diy.stackexchange.com   "this text appears when you mouse over")!
    This works with [reference links][blog] as well.

     [blog]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/   "click here for updates"

    Images are exactly like links, but they have an exclamation point in front of them:

     ![a busy cat](http://sstatic.net/stackoverflow/img/error-lolcat-problemz.jpg)
    ![two muppets][1]

     [1]: http://i.imgur.com/I5DFV.jpg "tooltip"

    The word in square brackets is the alt text, which gets displayed if the browser can't show the image. Be sure to include meaningful alt text for screen-reading software.

    Be sure to use text styling sparingly; only where it helps readability.

     *This is italicized*, and so
    is _this_.

    **This is bold**, just like __this__.

    You can ***combine*** them
    if you ___really have to___.

    To break your text into sections, you can use headers:

     A Large Header
    ==============

    Smaller Subheader
    -----------------

    Use hash marks if you need several levels of headers:

     # Header 1 #
    ## Header 2 ##
    ### Header 3 ###

    Both bulleted and numbered lists are possible:

     -   Use a minus sign for a bullet
    +   Or plus sign
    *   Or an asterisk

    1.   Numbered lists are easy
    2.   Markdown keeps track of
     the numbers for you
    7.   So this will be item 3.

     1.   Lists in a list item:
         -   Indented four spaces.
             *   indented eight spaces.
         -   Four spaces again.
    2.    You can have multiple
         paragraphs in a list items.
      
         Just be sure to indent.

     > Create a blockquote by
    > prepending “>” to each line.
    >
    > Other formatting also works here, e.g.
    >
    > 1. Lists or
    > 2. Headings:
    >
    > ## Quoted Heading ##

    You can even put blockquotes in blockquotes:

     > A standard blockquote is indented
    > > A nested blockquote is indented more
    > > > > You can nest to any depth.

    To create code blocks or other preformatted text, indent by four spaces:

          This will be displayed in a monospaced font. The first four spaces
         will be stripped off, but all other whitespace will be preserved.
         
         Markdown and HTML are turned off in code blocks:
         <i>This is not italic</i>, and [this is not a link](http://example.com)

    To create not a block, but an inline code span, use backticks:

     The `$` character is just a shortcut for `window.jQuery`.

    If you want to have a preformatted block within a list, indent by eight spaces:

     1. This is normal text.
    2. So is this, but now follows a code block:
      
             Skip a line and indent eight spaces.
             That's four spaces for the list
             and four to trigger the code block.

    If you need to do something that Markdown can't handle, use HTML. Note that we only support a very strict subset of HTML!

     Strikethrough humor is <strike>funny</strike>.

    Markdown is smart enough not to mangle your span-level HTML:

     <b>Markdown works *fine* in here.</b>

    Block-level HTML elements have a few restrictions:
        They must be separated from surrounding text by blank lines.
        The begin and end tags of the outermost block element must not be indented.
        Markdown can't be used within HTML blocks.

     <pre>
     You can <em>not</em> use Markdown in here.
    </pre>
