Guide to Forest Inventory and Analysis Overview of the Purpose of This Report
This report presents a summary of Guam’s forest resources from the most recent data collected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program in 2013 across all ownerships and forest types. It updates previously published findings from data collected in 2002 (Donnegan et al. 2004). We summarize and interpret basic resource information, including forest area, ownership, land use change, biomass, biodiversity, standing dead wood, and forest health indicators. The Pacific Northwest Research Station Forest Inventory and Analysis (PNW-FIA) program implemented a sampling strategy on Guam that measures forest and nonforest vegetated plots, within a single year, on an intended 10-year cycle. PNW-FIA partners with Guam’s researchers and forest managers to use the inventory data to help answer local and national questions about the status and trends in tropical forests. These data update those published in the earlier report; however, not all the values presented here can be directly compared to previous reports or datasets to assess change in Guam’s forest resources over the past decade. Consistent sampling and field protocols standardized across different ownerships and forest management regimes allow for comparisons of change over time only for certain attributes. This report covers all forested and vegetated nonforest lands on Guam, with estimates representing averaged values computed from all inventory plots visited by field crews in 2013.
Description of the Forest Inventory and Analysis Program
The FIA program was established in 1928 to conduct unbiased assessments of the nation’s forested lands for use in economic and forest management planning. The program was charged with collecting forest data on a series of permanent field plots, compiling and making these data publicly available, and providing research and interpretations from the data. Four FIA units are responsible for inventories of all forested lands in the United States, including the insular areas and territories of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands, and freely associated Pacific Island nations of the Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Republic of Palau. Historically, each of the four regional FIA units responsible for forest inventories in the United States implemented inventory methods to best fit its respective regional forest conditions and client needs, resulting in inconsistent national reporting (USDA FS 2006). After passage of the 1998 Farm Bill, the FIA program implemented an annualized inventory that was designed to be nationally consistent as well as spatially and temporally unbiased with respect

RESOURCE BULLETIN PNW-RB-270
to forest types and land ownership groups (Bechtold and Patterson 2005). All FIA units use a common plot design, common set of measurement protocols, and standard database design for compilation and distribution of data. Under this unified approach, FIA is able to provide unbiased estimates of a wide variety of forest conditions over all forested lands in the United States in a consistent and timely manner.
The national design was adapted for the Guam inventory to include additional branching and rooting forms and additional tree crown measurements, as well as special interest species ranging from invasive plants to pathogens to invasive insects and animals. With significant project support from the Government of Guam’s Forestry Division and the University of Guam, 48 plots were spaced uniformly at 1.9-mi intervals using a hexagonal grid, resulting in a threefold intensification of the spacing used in the mainland U.S. inventory plot grid. Forest inventory plots included four 24-ft fixed-radius subplots, where a variety of information was collected at the plot, subplot, and tree levels (USDA FS 2012). Primary variables collected include plot location, slope, aspect, elevation, subplot slope position and slope shape, tree species, diameters, heights, damages, branching and rooting forms, decay, and epiphytic loadings. Additional information about annual inventories is available in appendix 1 of this report and at http://fia.fs.fed.us/.
Common FIA Terminology
What is a tree?— The U.S. Forest Service defines a tree as a woody perennial plant, usually with a single well-defined stem carrying a crown, with a minimum height of 15 ft at maturity (USDA FS 2006). What is a forest? — Forests come in many shapes and sizes, varying from complex and species diverse to monoculture plantations. The FIA program defines forest land as an area currently or formerly (within 30 years) having at least 10 percent crown cover by trees of any size and not currently developed for nonforest use (USDA FS 2006). Forest land must be at least 1 ac in size with a minimum continuous width of 120 ft.

Forest Resources on Guam
The island of Guam (fig. 1) is the largest and farthest south in the north-sweeping Marianas archipelago (fig. 2). The highest point on the island is Mount Lamlam at 1,332 ft elevation. Guam is an unincorporated territory of the United States and has the highest human population of any island in Micronesia. The climate is tropical marine with little annual variation in temperature, but with a pronounced dry season from January to May (Manner 1993) (fig. 3).
Forest Area
About half of Guam is forested (53 percent) (fig. 4). The island’s total land area is about 132,230 ac, with 69,851 forested ac (table 1). A significant area of land is occupied by the U.S. military; on a portion of this area, a system of refuges and wildlife reserves has been designated. For example, Ritidian Point, about 22,500 ac in size at the northern tip of Guam, is administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as a national wildlife refuge. The northern half of the island is generally a flat limestone plateau that can be strongly weathered into rugged karst topography. The limestone soils in the north are covered with forest in areas that are not cultivated or urbanized. The southern side of the island features a terrain composed of deeply weathered volcanic soils primarily covered by grassland, with some ravine forest in sheltered and leeward sites.

Forest Composition
FIA crews identified 55 tree species on FIA plots in Guam (see “Scientific and Common Names of Plants Found During Inventory”). The most common tree species were Leucaena leucocephala, Guamia mariannae, and Hibiscus tiliaceus (table 2). The estimated total number of trees during this 2013 inventory was about 74 million. FIA plots on Guam each contained from 1 to 11 different tree species (fig. 5). Forest stands tended to be dominated by smaller size trees that are less than 5 inches in diameter (fig. 6). The diameter distribution for trees follows a reverse-J pattern on Guam (fig. 7). Frequent typhoon disturbance and the abundance of numerous species of small-diameter, short-lived trees (such as Leucaena leucocephala) contribute to this pattern, which is persistent through time in many stands.

Volume, Biomass, and Carbon
Stem volume (wood) is a metric by which forest productivity, vigor, and structure can be assessed and modeled to examine current forest conditions and project future forest status. Field-derived tree length and diameter measurements are used to produce single-tree volume estimates, which are then expanded to assess volume for entire forested stands. Volume estimates can then be used in additional models to study forest biomass and carbon dynamics. Biomass and carbon distribution by diameter class follows closely the pattern seen in volume by diameter-class distribution (tables A2-5 and A2-6), in which biomass was concentrated in the small to medium stand-size classes. Trees 5.0 to 9.9 inches in diameter represented the highest overall pool of aboveground biomass (fig. 8).

Understory Vegetation
Understory vegetation is an important structural component in all forest ecosystems. The life form type and density of cover could affect forest structure and function, as well as influence wildlife habitat, spread of disease, soil stability, and competition between native and nonnative plants. FIA field crews sample understory vegetation in plots on forest and vegetated nonforest land. To reflect forest structure, the percentage of canopy cover by four structural layers and the percentage of total canopy cover to 1 percent are estimated for tree seedlings (trees <1.0 inch in diameter at breast height [d.b.h.]) and saplings (trees 1.0 to 4.9 inches d.b.h.); shrubs (woody, multiple-stem plants of any size, including woody vines); forbs (herbaceous, broadleaf plants, including nonwoody vines and ferns); and graminoids (grasses and grass-like plants, including rushes and sedges). To reflect species composition, the percentages of total canopy cover and main canopy layer are estimated for the four most abundant (≥3 percent canopy cover) life forms: seedlings and saplings, shrubs, forbs, and graminoid species. Graminoids were the most common understory vegetation found on all FIA plots, followed by seedlings and saplings, shrubs, and woody vines (fig. 9).

Extent of Standing Dead Wood
Standing dead trees (snags) represent an important component of forest structure and wildlife habitat. FIA plot measurements are well suited to estimating standing dead wood throughout all forest types and ownerships across the island. Dead trees fill many ecologically important roles in forests. Dead wood in a forest provides habitat for wildlife, insects, and fungi (both native and invasive); improves soil fertility through nutrient cycling and moisture retention; adds to fuel loads; and is a key structural element in mature forests. Large-scale disturbances caused by weather events and insects can substantially increase input into the dead wood pool, leading to a notable effect on the total dead wood stores present. Dead wood resources are complex, and FIA provides estimates of the amount of standing dead trees (snags). There are approximately 30,251 tons of dead wood on Guam: 21,331 tons in the 5.0- to 9.9-inch diameter class and 8,920 tons in the >10-inch diameter class (fig. 10; table A2-6).
Nontimber Forest Products
Nontimber forest products are those not traditionally included as timber in economic reporting. These products contribute in important ways to the livelihoods and welfare of people living in and near forests. They provide construction materials, fencing, furniture, foods, medicines, fibers, floral products, plant oils, dyes, food wrapping, fuels, and livestock feed, and represent other important cultural values (Dawson et al. 2014). In Guam’s FIA plots, Cocos nucifera and Pandanus tectorius had the highest number of trees of these species of interest (fig. 11) and are used as a food crop and for handicrafts.

Forest Health
Forests are complex ecosystems composed of plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria that interact with each other and with nonbiotic elements. Trees dominate forested landscapes, but less obvious components such as fungi and soil microbes are also important (Molina 1994), with each piece of the system playing a role in creating a balanced and healthy environment. Forests can sequester carbon from the atmosphere, serve as longterm carbon storage (Harmon et al. 1990), protect soil from erosion, and remove pollutants to improve air quality (Nowak et al. 2014). On Guam, forests comprise nearly 53 percent of the land area, and the health of these forests affects their ability to maintain forest species composition and function and protect surrounding environments.

RESOURCE BULLETIN PNW-RB-270
Forest Disturbances and Their Extent
The forests on Guam have been affected by typhoons, droughts, urbanization, wildfires, and invasions of introduced insects, plants, and ungulate species. Introduced ungulates such as the Philippine deer (Rusa marianna) and feral pigs (Sus scrofa) consume seeds, fruits, and foliage, and trample and uproot regenerating plants, inhibiting forest regeneration (Morton et al. 2000). In the mid-1940s, the unintentional introduction of the brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis) led to the functional extirpation of native seed dispersing birds from the forests (Rogers et al. 2017). Declines and losses of native species as a result of these disturbances have been especially severe on Guam, prompting the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in 2015, to add 23 species to the federal list of endangered and threatened wildlife and plants on Guam (50 C.F.R. § 17 2015). Guam is located in “Typhoon Alley,” where interactions between frequent tropical storms and anthropogenic disturbances, which expose soil and fragment ecosystems, have greatly altered natural communities (Mafnas 2010). Guam is also anticipating an increase in its human population because of the expansion of U.S. military installations, where proposed housing development and other activities are expected to eliminate about 9 percent of Guam’s forest area (Mafnas 2010). Disturbances on forest and nonforest land on Guam were generally caused by fire, animals and insects (fig. 12). The presence of conks, other fungi fruiting bodies, and signs of advanced decay, i.e., rot in sapwood/heartwood of trees, represented the majority of tree damage (57 percent) observed in inventory plots (fig. 13).

Insects

In 2003, an unintentional introduction of cycad scale (Aulacaspis yasumatsui) on

Guam resulted in a steep decline in the population of native cycad species (Cycas

circinalis), raising many concerns about the subsequent ecosystem response

(Marler and Lawrence 2012). Rhi-

Invasive Vegetation
Invasive plants can significantly alter forest structure and composition and can diminish ecosystem resilience to other disturbance processes. Accidental or intentional introductions of forbs, shrubs, vines, and trees have profoundly affected the environment on Guam (fig. 15). Invasive plants tend to proliferate owing to an absence of natural enemies and the inability of native plant species to compete with invasive species (Muniappan et al. 2002). During World War II, large areas of vegetation were cleared, leading to an increase in nonnative woody species such as Leucaena leucocephala (Fosberg 1960, Savidge 1987). Small oceanic islands are exceptionally vulnerable to damages caused by intentional and unintentional introduction of alien species that, once established, are difficult or even impossible to eradicate (Marler and Lawrence 2012, Van Driesche et al. 2010). Nineteen invasive species out of a list of 38 species identified by local land managers were found during the 2013 inventory (table 3). Vitex parviflora and Leucaena leucocephala were the most dominant invasive plant species present in 2013 (fig. 16).

Conclusions
This report presents an updated overview of Guam’s forest resources, highlighting information that is new as well as confirming previously known information. Some readers may want to see more indepth research and analysis on selected topics to fully understand the current state and changes taking place in Guam’s forests. Note, however, that not all the results published in this report can be directly compared to those in the previous report (Donnegan et al. 2004) for the purpose of assessing changes in forest resources over the past decade. Use of the same sampling protocols and plot design in the future will support meaningful assessment of change in each 10-year interval between field visits. Long-term forest monitoring in FIA plots is expected to provide information on the impacts of disturbances such as invasive species on tree growth and survival. Armed with these data, we can begin quantifying trends in Guam’s forest, from the growth and survival of understory seedlings to large, landscape-level shifts in forests from such challenges associated with a growing population and a changing climate.

Appendix 1: Inventory Design and Methods Field Design and Sampling Method
The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program conducts a systematic, samplebased field inventory across all ownerships on a periodic basis, remeasuring the same plots approximately every 10 years. All FIA units use a common plot design, common set of measurement protocols, and a standard database design for compilation and distribution of data. Adaptations were made to the national design for the Guam inventory to include additional branching and rooting forms and additional tree crown measurements, as well as special interest species ranging from invasive plants to pathogens to invasive insects and animals.
With active assistance from our partners at the University of Guam, 48 plots were spaced uniformly at 1.9-mi intervals using a hexagonal grid, at a threefold intensification of the spacing used in the mainland United States inventory plot grid. Forest inventory plots included four 24-ft, fixed-radius subplots in which a variety of information is collected at the plot, subplot, and tree levels (USDA FS 2012). Primary variables collected include plot location, slope, aspect, elevation, subplot slope position and slope shape, tree species, diameters, heights, damages, branching and rooting forms, decay, and epiphytic loadings.
All plots classified by aerial photography as possibly being forested are established in the field without regard to land use or land cover. Field crews delineate areas within the plot that are comparatively less heterogeneous than the plot as a whole with regard to reserved status, owner group, forest type, stand-size class, and tree density; these areas are described as condition classes. The process of delineating these condition classes on a fixed-radius subplot is called mapping. All measured trees are assigned to the mapped condition class in which they are located.
On plots, crews assess physical characteristics such as slope, aspect, and elevation; stand characteristics such as age, size class, forest type, disturbance, site productivity, and regeneration status; and tree characteristics such as tree species, diameter, height, damages, decay, and vertical crown dimensions. They also collect general descriptive information such as proximity to water and roads and the geographic position of the plot in the larger landscape.
Estimates of tree volume and other forest attributes were derived from tree measurements and classifications made at each plot. A number of other variables are unique to the Pacific Northwest Research Station’s FIA program. These are “regional” variables and include such items as insect and disease damage, a record of previous disturbance on the plot. The Pacific Islands standardized plot installed at each forested location is a cluster of four subplots spaced 120 ft apart (fig. A1-1). Subplot 1 is in the center, with subplots 2 through 4 distributed radically around it.

Data Processing
The data used for this report are stored in the FIA National Information Management System (NIMS), which provides a means to input, edit, process, manage, and distribute FIA data. It includes a process for data loading, a national set of edit checks to ensure data consistency, an error correction process, approved equations and algorithms, code to compile and calculate attributes, a table report generator, and routines to populate the presentation database. The NIMS applies numerous algorithms and equations to calculate such variables as stand size, volume, and

biomass. It also generates estimates and associated statistics based on county areas and stratum weights developed outside of NIMS. Additional FIA statistical design and estimation techniques are further reviewed in Bechtold and Patterson (2005).
Statistical Estimates
Throughout this report, we have published standard errors (SE) for most of our estimates. These SEs account for the fact that we measured only a small sample of the forest (thereby producing a sample-based estimate) and not the entire forest (which is the population parameter of interest). Because of small sample sizes or high variability within the population, some estimates can be very imprecise. The reader is encouraged to take the SE into account when drawing any inference. One way to consider this type of uncertainty is to construct confidence intervals. Customarily, 66- or 95-percent confidence intervals are used. A 95-percent confidence interval means that one can be 95 percent confident that the interval contains the true population parameter of interest. For more details about confidence intervals, please consult Moore and McCabe (1989) or other statistical literature.
Access Denied, Hazardous, or Inaccessible Plots
Although every effort was made to visit all field plots that were entirely or partially forested, some were not sampled for a variety of reasons. Field crews may have been unable to obtain permission from the landowner to access the plot, and some plots were impossible for crews to safely reach or access. Some private landowners deny access to their land, but privately owned plots usually are not as hazardous or inaccessible as plots on public land. Although permission to visit public land is almost always granted, some public land lies in higher elevation areas that can be very dangerous or impossible to reach.
This kind of missing data can introduce bias into the estimates if the nonsampled plots tend to be different from the entire population. Plots that are obviously nonforested (based on aerial photos) are rarely visited, and therefore the proportion of denied-access, hazardous, or inaccessible plots is significantly smaller than it is for forested plots. The poststratification approach outlined in Bechtold and Patterson (2005) removes nonsampled plots from the sample. Estimates are adjusted for plots that are partially nonsampled by increasing the estimates by the nonsampled proportion within each stratum.

Glossary
abiotic—Pertaining to nonliving factors such as temperature, moisture, and wind.
aerial photography—Imagery acquired from an aerial platform (typically aircraft or helicopter) by means of a specialized large-format camera with well-defined optical characteristics. The geometry of the aircraft orientation at the time of image acquisition is also recorded. The resultant photograph will be of known scale, positional accuracy, and precision. Aerial photography for natural resource use is usually either natural color or color-infrared, and is film-based or acquired using digital electronic sensors.
aspect—Compass direction that a slope faces.
biodiversity—Variety and variability among living organisms and the ecological complexes in which they occur. Diversity can be defined as the number of different items and their relative frequencies. https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlasbenefit-category-biodiversity-conservation. (27 October 2019).
biomass—The aboveground weight of wood and bark in live trees 1.0 inch in diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) and larger from the ground to the tip of the tree, excluding all foliage. The weight of wood and bark in lateral limbs, secondary limbs, and twigs under 0.5 inch in diameter at the point of occurrence on sapling-size trees is included in the measure, but is excluded on poletimber- and sawtimber-size trees. Biomass is typically expressed as green oven-dry weight in tons (USDA FS 2006).
bole—Trunk or main stem of a tree.
damage—Damage to trees caused by biotic agents such as insects, diseases, and animals or abiotic agents such as weather, fire, or mechanical equipment.
diameter at breast height (d.b.h.)—The diameter of a tree stem, located 4.5 ft above the ground (breast height) on the uphill side of a tree. The point of diameter measurement may vary on abnormally formed trees (USDA FS 2006).
disturbance—Any relatively discrete event in time that disrupts ecosystem, community, or population structure and changes resources, substrate availability, or the physical environment (Helms 1998).
down woody material (DWM)—Dead material on the ground in various stages of decay. It includes coarse and fine wood material. Previously named down woody debris (DWD). https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/fia/data-tools/state-reports/glossary/default. asp (27 October 2019).

American Samoa’s Forest Resources: Forest Inventory and Analysis, 2012
ecosystem—A spatially explicit, relatively homogeneous unit of the Earth that includes all interacting organisms and components of the abiotic environment within its boundaries. An ecosystem can be of any size: a log, a pond, a field, a forest, or the Earth’s biosphere (Helms 1998).
elevation—Height above a fixed reference point, often the mean sea level.
erosion—The wearing away of the land surface by running water, wind, ice, or other geological agents.
fixed-radius plot—A circular sampled area with a specified radius in which all trees of a given size, shrubs, and other items are tallied (USDA FS 2006).
forb—A broad-leaved herbaceous plant, as distinguished from grasses, shrubs, and trees (USDA FS 2006).
forest land—Land that is at least 10 percent tree cover by forest trees of any size, or land formerly having such tree cover, and not currently developed for a nonforest use (USDA FS 2006).
forest type—A classification of forest land based on and named for the tree species that forms the plurality of live-tree cover that are not overtopped (USDA FS 2006). These forest types are also called forest communities and are delineated by the classification guide outlined in Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg (1998).
forest type group—A combination of forest types that share closely associated species or site requirements (USDA FS 2006).
graminoid—Grasses (family Gramineae or Poaceae) and grass-like plants such as sedges (family Cyperaceae) and rushes (family Juncaceae).
grassland—Land on which the vegetation is dominated by grasses, grass-like plants, or forbs.
invasive plant—A plant that is not native to the ecosystem under consideration and that causes or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human, animal, or plant health. http://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/docs/council/isacdef. pdf. (5 January 2015).
live trees—All living trees, including all size classes, all tree classes, and both commercial and noncommercial species listed in the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) field manual (USDA FS 2006).
mortality—The death of trees from natural causes, or subsequent to incidents such as storms, wildfire, or insect and disease epidemics (Helms 1998).
41

RESOURCE BULLETIN PNW-RB-270
native species—Plant species that were native to an American region prior to EuroAmerican settlement. For vascular plants, they are the species that are not present on the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service list of nonnative species (see nonnative species) (USDA NRCS 2000).
nonforest land—Land that has never supported forests or formerly was forested and currently is developed for nonforest uses. Included are lands used for agricultural crops, residential areas, and constructed roads. The area must be at least 1.0 ac and 120.0 ft wide.
nonnative species—Plant species that were introduced to America subsequent to Euro-American settlement. Nonnative vascular plants are present on the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service list of nonnative species (USDA NRCS 2000).
nontimber forest products (NTFP)—Species harvested from forests for reasons other than production of timber commodities.
ownership—A legal entity having an ownership interest in land, regardless of the number of people involved. An ownership may be an individual; a combination of persons; a legal entity such as corporation, partnership, club, or trust; or a public agency. An ownership has control of a parcel or group of parcels of land (USDA FS 2006).
pathogen—An organism or virus directly capable of causing disease or mortality.
regeneration—The established progeny from a parent plant, seedlings or saplings existing in a stand, or the act of renewing tree cover by establishing young trees naturally or artificially. May be artificial (direct seeding or planting) or natural (natural seeding, coppice, or root suckers) (adapted from Helms 1998).
remote sensing—Capture of information about the Earth from a distant vantage point. The term is often associated with satellite imagery but also applies to aerial photography, airborne digital sensors, ground-based detectors, and other devices.
reserved forest land—Land permanently reserved from wood products utilization through statute or administrative designation. Examples include national forest wilderness areas and national parks and monuments (USDA FS 2006).
sampling error—Difference between a population value and a sample estimate that is attributable to the sample, as distinct from errors due to bias in estimation, errors in observation, etc. Sampling error is measured as the standard error of the sample estimate (Helms 1998).
sapling—A live tree 1.0 to 4.9 inches in diameter (USDA FS 2006).

species group—A collection of species used for reporting purposes (USDA FS 2006).
stand-size class—A classification of stands based on tree size. Large-diameter stands have the majority of trees at least 11.0 inches d.b.h. for hardwoods and 9.0 inches d.b.h. for softwoods; medium-diameter stands have the majority of trees at least 5.0 inches d.b.h. but not as large as large-diameter trees; and small-diameter stands have the majority of trees less than 5.0 inches d.b.h.
stratification—A statistical tool used to reduce the variance of the attributes of interest by partitioning the population into homogenous strata (Bechtold and Patterson 2005).
