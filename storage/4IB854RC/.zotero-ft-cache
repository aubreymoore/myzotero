Abstract

The Korean insect industry is rapidly developing, with the Korean horn beetle Allomyrina dichotoma as one of the most popular insects kept as pets. Korean horn beetles reared in local farms are suffering from Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) . In a nationwide investigation on the early death of young larvae due to this virus, 70 to 77% mortality was found. It was also confirmed that several larvae collected from some wild horn beetle habitats were infected with the virus. Thus, it was concluded that the virus could be transmitted vertically from an infected adult to the offspring and that the OrNV disease is a very serious threat to the wild horn beetle in Korea. With local farmers expecting that an early detection technique would be helpful for the quick removal of infected larvae, an on‐site diagnosis method for the viral disease using loop‐mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was thus tested. To avoid the DNA extraction process, the LAMP assay used a 50‐fold diluted hemolymph was set for diagnosis standardization and convenient on‐site application to infected larvae from local farms. A. dichotoma larvae were assayed for the OrNV infectivity with LAMP primers targeting the OrNV_gp102 gene. To evaluate the LAMP specificity, two bacterial pathogens, Bacillus thuringiensis and Serratia marcescens , causing disease in A. dichotoma were tested along with OrNV . The positive results were detected only from the OrNV ‐infected larvae.
