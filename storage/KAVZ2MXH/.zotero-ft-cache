It looks like one of the island’s most notorious invasive species is helping another, according to researchers.

A recent study shows a lack of birds and rats — due to the brown tree snake — is making it easier for rhino beetles to breed in the crowns of coconut trees, something that usually doesn’t happen.

The Guam coconut rhinoceros beetle research team at the University of Guam documented some disturbing and unusual behavior, which was been published in the September issue of the Florida Entomologist journal, a release from the university stated.

The coconut rhinoceros beetle was first discovered in Guam in Tumon Bay in 2007. It has since spread throughout the island.

In an attempt to eradicate the beetle, the coconut rhinoceros beetle research team focused on sanitation to clean up possible breeding sites of decaying matter, the release stated. Once sanitation was accomplished, the team noticed there was no significant decrease in beetles found in traps around the area, which they found puzzling.
The results of a study by the University of Guam showed

The results of a study by the University of Guam showed that all life stages of the coconut rhinoceros beetle, from egg, larva, pupa, and adult, were found in the crowns of 10 out of 26 coconut trees that were felled. These coconut trees show signs of rhino beetle damage.   (Photo: University of Guam)

“Although we had found (coconut rhinoceros beetle) eggs and larvae in the crowns of coconut trees, we thought this rarely happened.” said University of Guam extension entomologist Aubrey Moore.

Coconut rhinoceros beetle eggs and larvae had occasionally been found developing in waste captured in the crowns of coconut palms in Guam, but researchers had considered this to be a rare occurrence.

Moore and the Guam Coconut Rhinoceros Eradication Project team decided to systematically investigate what was happening in the crowns of coconut trees in Tumon. The results of the study showed that all life stages of the beetle — egg, larva, pupa and adult — were found in the crowns of 10 out of 26 coconut trees.

“Although arboreal breeding of (coconut rhinoceros beetle) larvae has been reported in the literature, the occurrence of this phenomenon on Guam is much higher than elsewhere,” stated Roland Quitugua, Coconut Rhinoceros Eradication Project director.

The research team attributes this behavior to the loss of birds and rats through predation by the brown tree snake, which was accidentally introduced to Guam after World War II. On other islands, rats and birds feed on larvae found in the crowns of trees.

The discovery of how widespread the breeding of coconut rhinoceros beetles in treetops is in Guam has lead to new sanitation recommendations for the control of the beetles. Researchers recommend keeping the tops of coconut trees clear of dead fronds and other debris in order to deter the beetle.

Palm trees that are manicured to remove dead fronds and other detritus are much less likely to harbor breeding coconut rhinoceros beetle populations, the release stated.
