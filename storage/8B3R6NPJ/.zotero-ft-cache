The coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), Oryctes rhinoceros,  has been attacking coconut trees on Guam since it was first discovered on the island in 2007 and has proven to be voracious and tenacious. The coconut rhinoceros beetle, is a major pest of coconut palm, oil palm and other palm species. Palms are damaged when adult beetles bore into the crowns of palms to feed on sap. Tree mortality occurs when beetles destroy the growing tip (meristem). Immature beetles (grubs) do no damage. They feed on dead, decaying vegetation in breeding sites. Preferred breeding sites are dead, standing coconut stems, and piles of decaying vegetation such those left behind by typhoons or after replanting of oil palm plantations.
