5.2 Program Learning Objectives (from the UoG Catalog)
5.2.1 Learning Objectives for Agriculture Students Disciplinary Knowledge: Graduates apply their agricultural knowledge and skills in the production of agricultural products using best management practices and addressing locally important issues such as island pocket economies, conservation, invasive species and endangered species problems. They use their knowledge and understanding of scientiﬁc concepts to diagnose and solve problems in agricultural ﬁelds.
1. Quantitative Skills: Graduates apply numerical methods in research design, ﬁnancial analysis, pesticide and fertilizer application, irrigation and ﬁeld setup and use computers for analysis of data and preparation of reports of results.

1. Quantitative skills: Graduates apply numerical methods in research design, and use computers for analysis manipulating and modeling biological data.
2. Research/laboratory skills: Graduates are competent in basic biology procedures and safety in the laboratory and the ﬁeld; they formulate testable hypotheses and create eﬀective experimental designs using their knowledge, understanding, and practical experience of scientiﬁc instruments.
3. Communication skills: Graduates use scientiﬁc literature and diagrams as a source of information, properly cite sources and avoid plagiarism, and create text and graphics to communicate results eﬀectively through print and oral presentations. They collect and assess evidence and use it to create eﬀective arguments in writing scientiﬁc reports and proposals.
4. Digital Literacy: Graduates use and process information in multiple formats via computer. Graduates are competent in the following computer skills as related to their science work: desktop competencies, word processing, presentation, and data retrieval and manipulation. Graduates eﬀectively judge the usefulness and accuracy of external sources of information.
5. Professionalism: Graduates work eﬀectively together in teams in a laboratory and ﬁeld settings and follow ethical principles underlying scientiﬁc research and pub-

lication. Graduates understand and apply the values and limitations of scientiﬁc research in addressing public policy issues.
5.3 Student Learning Outcomes for AG/BI 345
Upon completion of AG/BI 345, General Entomology: 1. Students will be able to accurately identify any insect on Guam to the taxonomic level of Order and in most cases to Family. 2. Students will be familiar with the behavior and biology of common insects on Guam. 3. Students will know how to collect insects and preserve them as museum quality specimens with proper labeling. 4. Students will have an understanding of the importance of insects in ecosystem function. 5. Students will be aware of negative impacts of invasive species on Guam’s ecosystems and economy and will be certiﬁed as First Detectors by the National Plant Diagnostics Network. 6. Students will know how to ﬁnd detailed information on insects in online resources and in the scientiﬁc literature.

8 Course Guidelines
8.1 Course Web Site
• All handouts and other course resources will be available on the Ag/BI 345 web site at http://guaminsects.net/AGBI345SITE.
8.2 Examinations
• Examinations are cummulative, meaning that you may be asked questions on any topics covered between the start of the course and the date of the exam.
• All exams are ’open book’ and you are free to use digital devices and online resources.
• Part of each exam will be spent identifying insect specimens.
8.3 Research Project
• Research projects will be done by teams of 1, 2 or 3 people. • Each team will make an oral presentation to propose their project during the
October 12 lab period. • Each team will submit a written research report and make an oral presentation
during the November 23 lab period.
8.4 First Detector Training
During this course you will learn about impacts of invasive species on Guam and other islands. You will be trained and certiﬁed as ’First Detector’ via a lecture and completion of online training modules provided by the National Plant Diagnostics Network at https://firstdetector.org/static/index.html.
8.5 Insect Collection
• You will be required to collect, preserve at least 35 insect species, with species from at least ten orders.
• We will not collect immature insects and soft bodied specimens which must be preserved in alcohol.
• We will use an iNaturalist project at http://www.inaturalist.org/projects/ ag-bi-345-f15 to record data for each specimen in the collection. I will provide software to print a catalog and pin labels.
7

• Collect adults only; spread Lepidoptera wings and mount minute insects on paper points
• You will recieve a maximum of 35 points for your collection. You will get one point for each specimen which: – is properly preserved (moths and butterﬂies spread; insects too small to pin on paper points) – has an observation record in iNaturalist – points will not be given for specimens which do not comply to the above items – points will not be given for duplicate specimens with the same species
