INTRODUCTION
Guam is an island and U.S. territory in the western Pacific. Guam, Puerto Rico, and Florida are the only places controlled by the U.S. where native cycads grow. Guam is also the only place in the U.S. where there are native populations of cycads in the genus Cycas (Puerto Rico and Florida have only Zamia species). Cycas micronesica, known on Guam as fadang, is distributed from the Mariana Island group south into the western Caroline Islands. Taxonomy is complicated in this species, with several distinct, recognizable taxa requiring further study occurring in the region of Yap, Palau, and the Philippines. (See http://plantnet.rbgsyd.gov.au/cgi-bin/cycadpg?taxname=Cycas+micronesica for more information on this cycad species.)
As an island, Guam’s ecosystem is much more susceptible to perturbances than continental ecosystems. One example of a disruption that might have a significant negative impact on an island ecosystem is the introduction of an exotic plant or animal. Not having co-evolved with the alien invader, such an ecosystem may not have the proper defense mechanisms to keep the invasive species in check. Just such an event happened when the brown tree snake, Boiga irregularis, was accidentally introduced to Guam via cargo transported by U.S. military ships during World War II. This exotic reptile rapidly increased in numbers, preying primarily on birds. Its density has been estimated at up to 13,000 snakes per square mile, and this snake has virtually wiped out 12 species of endemic forest birds on Guam. Because many of the island’s plant species are dependent on the various bird species, the plants are now at risk of decline or extinction because of the loss of the birds. (See http://www.invasivespecies.gov/profiles/bts.shtml for more information on this invasive pest reptile.)
A more recent example of an accidental—albeit preventable—introduction of an invasive pest organism to Guam occurred in 2003 when the cycad aulacaspis scale (CAS), Aulacaspis yasumatusi, found its way to the island as a passenger on king sago (Cycas revoluta) nursery plants imported from the U.S. mainland. CAS is a species of armored scale insect from Thailand, where it preys on native cycads of the genus Cycas. Because it evolved in Thailand, pest populations are kept under control in that country by natural predators. The young CAS insects, called crawlers, are capable of movement and can be carried short distances on air currents. When they find a suitable host plant, they insert their mouthparts into the plant and start feeding. Shortly thereafter they begin to secrete a white, waxy covering over themselves. This covering protects them in many ways—including from pesticide sprays—making them difficult to control. Female insects remain attached to the plant until their death. Male insects emerge shortly before death and fly in search of females for mating before they die. CAS reproduces very rapidly and can cover a large cycad within a matter of weeks. Unless the infestation is treated, death can occur in less than a year. (See http://www.montgomerybotanical.org/Pages/CASlinks.htm for more information on this pest insect.)
CAS was accidentally introduced into South Florida in 1995. It quickly spread throughout the state, and within a few years it had devastated the king sago nursery industry in Florida, resulting in economic losses in the millions of dollars. CAS insects are sometimes difficult to see because they tend to hide in plant roots and under leaf bases on the stems. As a result, hitch-hiking insects have been spread to several

islands in the Caribbean—such as Puerto Rico, the Cayman Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands—and even to such far-away places as Hawaii, Hong Kong, Singapore, and, most recently, Guam. CAS has also been intercepted in Europe, but it has not become established there.

GUAM INVASION TIMELINE
February 2000: Dr. Thomas Marler wrote an article about CAS for the Pacific Daily News, Guam’s local newspaper (Attachment 1). In the article, Marler pointed out the threat to Guam’s native cycad and suggested that local nurseries and landscape companies stop importing king sago nursery plants in an effort to reduce the likelihood of CAS reaching Guam. Unfortunately, this warning was not heeded.
October 2003: Small, white insects were first noticed on king sago plants in urban landscapes near Tumon Bay on Guam’s west coast. Marler collected some insects in December 2003 and sent them off to various experts to be identified.
March 2004: The white pest insects were positively identified as CAS. Marler immediately wrote another article in the Pacific Daily News alerting the residents of Guam about this newly introduced pest (Attachment 2). In this article, Marler again warned that CAS could potentially affect the fadang population of Guam if not controlled and provided advice on how residents could combat the pest. Marler also cautioned against movement of king sago or any other cycad nursery plants from Guam to Rota, Saipan, or any other neighboring island.
September 2004: Marler announced that wild fadang plants in the jungles of Ypao Point on the south end of Tumon Bay had begun to die from CAS infestations. Marler stated that the infestation at Ypao Point was isolated from other jungle habitats by the urban environments of Tumon Bay and Tamuning. He also warned that inaction could allow CAS to enter the jungles on the north end of the bay, which are not so contained, and from there this pest could potentially sweep across the entire island. Once again, Marler’s warnings went unheeded.
May 2005: Marler wrote yet another newspaper article on CAS, only this time it was to announce that the pest had begun killing fadang plants in other parts of Guam (Attachment 3). In an e-mail to Jody Haynes (Cycad Biologist at Montgomery Botanical Center in Miami, FL) dated 5-31-05, Marler stated the following:
Probably more than half of the original [non-native] king sago population is already dead and more are dying weekly. Most of these planting sites are being replaced by palms. The Cycas micronesica plants are starting to drop off in the forests at alarming rates. I have had to abandon two of my primary sites for long-term research because every plant is infested in those two habitats. We have introduced the [lady] beetle from Hawaii and it has established in one habitat. We are now using collections from that habitat to disperse it as much as possible. Other biocontrol efforts are also underway. I have a new hire to work on mapping of the scale and biocontrol insect population spread. I will be hiring another soon for mitigation work, focusing on the use of Safari [which is a growth regulating pesticide made by Valent that was recently approved for use on Guam].
In this e-mail, Marler also stated that the scale is still contained on Guam but that it may be just a matter of time before it hops to one of the other islands. Marler then requested aid from Montgomery Botanical Center in the form of taxonomic expertise as well as support for the efforts being made by Anne Brooke, Wildlife Biologist at the Guam National Wildlife Refuge, with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) to have an emergency “threatened” or “endangered” status declared for Cycas micronesica. In

Brooke’s correspondence with the USFWS, she countered the agency’s reticence at listing yet another species as threatened or endangered by stating that “the scale is moving so fast that there may be no cycads left to be listed.”

JUSTIFICATION OF NEED
This situation on Guam is critical and we are desperately in need of emergency funding. This section will highlight the primary reasons justifying the need for emergency support.
1. The first reason is the very nature of this epidemic and the fact that this anthropogenic alien invasion is quite unique. Among the areas affected by this invasive pest insect, Guam is unfortunately the first to also have a susceptible native plant species. In fact, this is the first known case throughout human history where an alien insect has escaped from gardens to begin killing cycad plants in their native habitat. As predicted, CAS is now spreading through Guam’s forests, killing fadang plants at an alarming rate.
2. A second reason for funding this project is that fadang plants provide crucial food for other organisms. The fleshy, aromatic covering of fadang seeds is a preferred food item for the endangered Mariana fruit bat, Pteropus marianus marianus. Fadang is so resistant to most types of disturbance that its seeds are sometimes the only bat food item available in the forest following the destructive winds of a passing cyclone. Fewer than 100 Mariana fruit bats remain on Guam and it is unknown what effect the loss of fadang will have on these endangered bats. (For more information on Guam’s fruit bats, refer to the following website: http://www.fws.gov/pacific/pacificislands/wesa/marianabatindex.html.)
We have only just begun our herbivory surveys of Cycas micronesica. In our preliminary work, we have identified the indigenous stem borer, Dihammus marianarum (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), as a common cycad consumer. When these surveys are completed, there may be other native arthropod cycad consumers. Thus, the loss of this host species may also lead to the loss of several native species.
3. A third reason this project deserves emergency status is that cycad plants are part of a tripartite symbiotic system of organisms. As with many species of plants, cycad roots are invaded by mycorrhizal fungi. However, cycads also produce coralloid roots that are host to nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. Work in ex-situ sites reveals that any available genotype of cyanobacteria can invade coralloid roots. This is also probably true for mycorrhizae. Thus, determining the genetic variation of cycad mycorrhizae and cyanobacteria in the native habitat is needed to shed light on conservation of these important organisms. Loss of Cycas micronesica from Guam’s various populations could easily result in the permanent loss of local genotypes of these other organisms that make up this complex, interconnected system.
4. A fourth reason for considering this a top priority for emergency funding is the nature of cycad pollination dynamics. We now know that cycads are pollinated almost exclusively by obligate insect pollinators (Norstog & Nicholls, 1997; Whitelock, 2002). We are attempting to identify the insect(s) which co-evolved with Guam’s cycad population as the pollinators. At the present time, so many of the habitats are infested with CAS that it is difficult to find individual cycads suitable for pollination studies. The probability of one or more endemic, obligate insect pollinators occurring on Guam is highly likely. These beneficial insects will also be lost along with Guam’s cycad population should we continue to stand by and let the CAS epidemic continue unchecked.
5. Another issue requiring consideration is the sustainability and general health of Guam’s environment. In his most recent newspaper article, Marler quoted David Limtiaco, Chief of Forestry in Guam’s

Department of Agriculture, as follows: “Scientists use the phrase ‘ecosystem function’ as one of the ways to describe…health benefits provided by forests. And the consequences of human actions that reduce ecosystem function are generally more severe on small islands like Guam.” Aubrey Moore, entomologist at the University of Guam, was also quoted as saying, “[c]ascading negative impacts on the environment are actually quite common when humans accidentally introduce an alien organism to an island environment. The environmental damage spreads from one structural or functional component to another as each successive component is compromised.” According to Moore, this new threat to Guam’s cycad populations has a significant potential for causing a cascading ecological disaster similar to that caused by the brown tree snake because of the population density of fadang. Fadang is the most common forest plant species in the categories of mid- and upper-canopy, so its loss will alter the physiognomy of the forest dramatically and permanently.

These plants are not just a dominant component of Guam’s ecosystem; they are the most abundant arborescent species in Guam’s forests. As such, they have been supporting the coastal and riparian environments of Guam for all of these years. Considering their ability to fix nitrogen and input this essential nutrient into the ecosystem, no doubt they profoundly influence the chemistry of all terrestrial, aquatic, and marine habitats within and around which they reside. Thus, the exact longterm effects of the loss of fadang plants on all wildlife in Guam’s island ecosystem are unknown, but the prognosis is grim at best.

Our height increment data indicate that many of Guam’s coastal cycad plants are hundreds of years old. These plants have survived the Spanish-American War and two world wars; they have survived innumerable tropical cyclones; they have survived the invasion of intentionally introduced feral deer and pig populations and the accidental introduction of various insect species. Some of these individual plants “watched” Ferdinand Magellan and his fleet sail along Guam’s coast on 6 March 1521. And they endured the Spanish-Chamorro Wars that decimated the indigenous human population. Truly, the remaining plants comprise a long-lived botanical and cultural treasure, one that is in danger of disappearing forever. We simply cannot elect to continue to watch this tragedy without attempting to intervene. The impending cascade of detrimental effects is looming too large to justify apathy.

CURRENT & PROPOSED PEST MONITORING/CONTROL & GERMPLASM PRESERVATION EFFORTS
Since CAS was first observed in “the wild” on Guam, various efforts have been initiated to monitor the spread and provide control of the insects. A predatory beetle was introduced from Hawaii, and it has become established in one habitat. Collections from that habitat are now being used to disperse it as widely as possible to other infested populations, and other biocontrol efforts are also underway. A new full-time assistant has begun mapping the spread of the CAS and the biocontrol insect populations using GIS techniques. Another assistant will soon be hired for mitigation work, focusing on the use of an insect growth regulator called Safari to control the CAS insects on king sago plants in commercial and private landscapes within the major cities surrounding the affected area(s). Research is also being conducted to attempt to identify the specific pollinator insect species in a number of cycad populations.

Immediate efforts will need to include the following:
1. Formulating an immediate salvage plan for affected populations and both short-term and long-term conservation plans for the species on Guam.
2. Alerting the residents, governments, and conservation organizations of the region via print and other media of the importance of controlling this invasive insect pest on Guam and keeping it from spreading to other nearby islands where Cycas micronesica also resides.

3. Mounting an expedition to collect seeds from the various Cycas micronesica habitats and populations on Guam and the surrounding islands for the purpose of establishing a population-based ex-situ conservation germplasm collection at Montgomery Botanical Center.
4. Quickly upgrading the conservation status of Cycas micronesica via the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and the IUCN Red List.
5. Collecting predatory beetles in the habitat where they are established on Guam and re-releasing them throughout the island.
6. Sending an expert biocontrol entomologist to Asia to collect additional predatory insect species that may be useful in continuing biocontrol efforts. This will then be followed by intensive experiments aimed at determining the effectiveness of control and the prey specificity of each new potential insect predator.
7. Testing growth regulators that are sprayed on or injected into cycads for effectiveness of suppression of the CAS population in the urban environment and the urban-wildland interface.
8. Continuing GIS mapping of CAS and predatory beetle populations on Guam and the neighboring islands of Rota and Saipan.
9. Surveying additional islands for CAS—including Tinian, Yap, and Palau—and increasing the frequency of surveys on Rota. (Rota carries the highest risk of secondary invasion by CAS for two reasons: [1] it is the closest island to Guam and the many daily flights are just a few minutes in duration; [2] it has the second largest population of Cycas micronesica.)

Longer term research efforts should also include 1) studies on the interactions of various wildlife species with the cycads, 2) molecular genetic analyses of wild cycad populations on Guam and throughout the native range of Cycas micronesica, and 3) molecular studies of mycorrhizal fungi and cyanobacteria symbionts associated with the cycads, both within and among the various cycad habitats on Guam.
