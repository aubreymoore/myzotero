Guam Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle Project Technical Report CRB-2017-05-27
Container for Secure Shipment of Live Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle Adults
Prepared by Aubrey Moore and Roland Quitugua University of Guam Cooperative Extension Service
Updated June 1, 2017
A few years ago, we were asked to provide live CRB adults to be used in experiments conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Eric Jang at the USDA-ARS Paciﬁc Basin Research Center. Shipments were made under conditions speciﬁed by a USDA-APHIS 526 permit issued to Dr. Jang. The ﬁrst batches of beetles were shipped in Mason jars packed in the cardboard box in which they were purchased. On one occasion, a jar was broken during shipment. Fortunately, the beetle did not escape. This incident prompted us to design a more secure shipping container as described here. CRB adults have been shipped in this container many times without incident.
Notes
1. A small hole (1/32”) is drilled at the center of each end cap to provide gas exchange. 2. Prior to shipment, a single beetle is placed in each nipple ﬁlled with moist peat moss.
