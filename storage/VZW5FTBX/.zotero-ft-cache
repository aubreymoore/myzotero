Ecology of the Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros (L.) (Coleoptera: Dynastidae)'
A. Dexter Hinckley Department of Environmental Sciences, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22903 U.S.A.

ABSTRACT
The Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle (Oryctes rhirtoceros) is a major pest of the coconut palm in its Asian homeland and on the South Pacific islands it has invaded. Each adult female lays 3 or 4 clutches, with about 30 eggs per clutch, in logs or other concentrations of organic material over a period of 9 to 12 weeks. Eggs incubate 11 days, and, under favorable conditions, the first feeding of the adult will occur 17 weeks later. Boring down into the folded, emerging fronds, the adult can damage spadices and leaflets, with consequent loss in coconut production. The palm dies if the growing tip is destroyed by the beetle or by secondary infections. In hard logs or other nutritionally poor sites, preadult mortality of beetles may exceed 98 percent. However, many sites created by typhoons or human activities are more favorable and contribute to beetle population increase. To prevent economic losses, it is necessary to identify and remove or destroy these beetle-producing sites.

in parts of Western Samoa and the Philippines.

The immature stages are commonly found in coconut logs or stumps, although they can also occur in sawdust heaps and almost any other concentration of organic material. Despite its close links with the coconut palm, 0 , rhinoceros may have evolved in association with another palm. Paine (1967) suggested it might have subsisted primarily on inland palms, such as Corypha spp., which die after flowering. Under such circumstances, the availability of oviposition sites and larval food would not depend on palm mortality caused by adult feeding or other extrinsic factors. Whatever its original host

Cumber (1957) rightly indicated that any type of outbreak focus can e x ~ a n d and become selfperpetuating if attacks by the adult beetles become frequent enough to kill mature palms. This situation has happened on Koror and Peleliu in the Palaus and along the inland margins of plantations in Western Samoa.
My previous publications on the Rhinoceros Beetle described the damage it does to Pacific Island palms (Hinckley 1966) and animals associated with adults or immature stages in Western Samoa ( Hinckley 1967 ) . This paper presents an ecological life history of the beetle, describing some of the behavioral and environmental facto'rs that determine the location, number, and survival of each stage from egg through imago. Such information can help in the prediction of outbreaks and the identification of dangerously productive sites.

TECHNIQUES
Field techniques included: direct collection of adults from palms and of all stages from ground sites; trapping of adults at light and in artificial stumps; and exposure of standard (one meter long) coconut logs in different habitats. In the insectary and laboratory, observations were made on flight, oviposition, incubation, larval development, and adult feeding.
The collections of beetles from palms were usually made along transects through plantations. Each fresh burrow was probed with a hooked wire. If a beetle was present, it was removed, then taken back to the laboratory where it was measured and either dissected or used in behavior studies. The depths of occupied and empty burrows were measured. This procedure provided some information on feeding which was supplemented by laboratory trials with beetles in palm petioles or sugar cane.
Other beetles were caught in artificial stump traps. These traps (fig. 1 ) were made, in their simplest form, of three parts: a 1.8 m coconut log base embedded upright 30 cm in the ground, a tin can 11 cm deep and 15 cm wide placed on the log, and, on top of the tin, a 30 cm high coconut log cap, centrally perforated by a hole 2.5 cm wide. The diameters of the caps and bases were usually between 16 and 24 cm. At night, beetles landed on the cap, crawled down the hole and fell in the tin. The bases of the traps had to be replaced annually and the caps changed every six months. However, it was possible to use the old caps for oviposition trials, confining a female beetle in a cap, then splitting

the cap, making an egg count, and wiring the cap together again for further use.
For field collections from logs, heaps, and other breeding sites, measurements were made of volume, density, moisture content, and pH. All stages of 0. rhinoceros were counted and the presence of mortality or competitive factors noted.
Similar records were kept for the meter-long coconut logs exposed during the periods between August 1965 and April 1967 in Western Samoa and between April 1966 and May 1967 in Malaysia (set up by Mr. C. R. Wallace). In both countries, some of the logs were partially concealed by ground cover or low canopies and others were out in open fields surrounded by short grass. The objective of these trials was to evaluate the effects of "vegetative barriers" on the discovery and utilization of logs by the Rhinoceros Beetle or competitive organisms (other beetles, termites, etc.) .

the Palaus. Under favorable conditions, one generation, egg to egg, can be as short as 20 weeks. The total life span of individuals reaching maturity probably averages close to eight months, since there is evidence that grubs with prolonged development produce under-sized, short-lived adults.
O V ~ ~ O s ~ ~ ~ o ~ . - - A p p a raelmnot lsty any log or heap soft enough for burrowing, yet firm enough to provide compacted frass, may be utilized for oviposition. The female beetle makes a serpentine burrow, laying eggs one by one and compressing the chewed material behind her. At first soft and oblong, the egg swells into a rubbery globe four or five days after oviposition. 0. rhinoceros eggs were most commonly found in coconut logs or stumps, but they were also collected under or in other logs (pandanus, sago. breadfruit, kapok, erythrine, etc.) and from heaps of sawdust, grass, or refuse. The largest number found in any one site was 87, removed from the fibrous tip of a young palm blown down by a hurricane six months earlier. Other collections indicated that ovipositions in such soft material near the crown-trunk junction may have occurred less than a month after the hurricane. Similar results were obtained with logs exposed in grassy areas both in Western Samoa and Malaysia. In the Samoan trial, the first oviposition apparently was made under the " b a r k of a log 40 days after installation. Later oviposition burrows were more apt to be in the log ends, corroborating the sequence described by Cumber ( 1 9 5 7 ) for coconut stumps. After one year of exposure in grassy areas, 12 of the 25 coconut logs in Malaysia and 45 of the 100 logs in Samoa had served, at least once, as oviposition sites. However,

in Malaysia, 43 of the 50 logs in fern areas and, in 29 the 30 logs under dense cocoa
were still so hard that they could not readily be used ovip0sition burrowing. The cocoa-shaded logs
were first used as oviposition sites 15 months after installation.
The number of eggs laid during each oviposition was determined by using the coconut cap technique described earlier. In 42 trials, clutch size ranged
- from 11 to 62 and averaged 27. More eggs were uu
laid by larger female beetles than by small ones. Those with a mean length of 36 rnm averaged 22 eggs; 40 mm, 29 eggs; and 46 mm, 38 eggs.- Since
the average length of 631 female beetles in Samoa was 42.5 mm (the average for 762 male beetles was 41.1 m m ) , the normal clutch size should be close to
30. This estimate was supported by dissection of 145 gravid female beetles caught in artificial stump traps, or at light. Full-sized eggs averaged 22 in these beetles, and their ovaries contained others which presumably would mature during the oviposition period. The actual rate of oviposition reached 14 per day under optimal burrowing conditions but 4 or 5 per day was more typical. It is not known how many clutches are laid by each female beetle, but the cap experiments showed that they could lay a clutch every three weeks. If they live 15 weeks, they might be able to lay as many as 5 clutches, totaling 150 eggs. A conservative estimate, more in line with Gressitt's (1953) observations, would be
3 or 4 clutches, totaling between 90 and 120 eggs.
LARVALDEVELOPMENT.--After eclosion, the first instar grubs consume the chorions and start feeding on the burrow frass. In soft logs or heaps, the grubs can disperse freely from the oviposition site. Under such favorable conditions, development proceeds rapidly, and the third instar may be attained in six weeks. The larger grubs appear to avoid one another and are spaced out within the site. Simple laboratory trials with heat gradients in a compostfilled tray showed that grubs also avoid zones heated above 37" C (100" F ) , which would limit their movement in sun-heated logs or fermenting heaps. An analysis of larval density in important categories of sites is presented in table 2. The minimum volumes per grub were 400 cc in a coconut log; 5000 cc in a kapok log; 7000 cc in a breadfruit log; 7000 cc in sawdust; and 9000 cc in grass compost. Some larvae were found in sites where they would have little chance of getting enough nourishment to complete their development. Examples would include very hard breadfruit logs and rotten papaya stems. In the latter situation larvae were, however, able to reach the third instar.

In 15 of these trials, the beetles fed and their average stay was six days (range: 4 to 8 days). In the insectary, beetles bored into moist palm petioles or stalks of sugar cane.

Male beetles readily burrow into logs (Cumber 1957), and pairs in copula, with the male at a right angle to the female, were found under logs. Although the great distension of the bursa copulatrix in many of the female beetles indicated that multiple matings were common, a female beetle could continue to lay viable eggs for several months after one mating.
MORTALITY PATTERNS.-By following the fate of natural or artificial cohorts, it was possible to estimate larval survival to pupation (table 3 ) . The

ly. When laid by a female beetle in an oviposition burrow, the eggs were protected from most hazards. Similarly, aside from the rare Metarrhizium fungal infection, the pupa suffered no mortality in its chamber. About i0-20 percent of the larvae were infected by Met@r~hizizcrrza, level which may have increased through synergism with a virus recently introduced from Malaya (Marschall 1970). Some grubs in coconut logs were eaten by rodents, and some in sawdust heaps were consumed by larvae of the elaterid beetle, Lunelater fuscipes ( F ) , or parasitized by the scoliid wasp, Scolin ruficornzis F. The centipede, Scolopendra nzorsitmzs I.., was present both under logs and in sawdust heaps, and may have killed some accessible grubs. Generally, Oryctes rhinoceros immature stages within a coconut log are well protected from any natural enemy now present in Samoa (Hinckley 1967) In his survey of the Asian tropics, Paine ( 1967) examined "nearly 300 dead coconuts and 80 trunks of other palms" but found little evidence of effective parasitization or predation.

highest survival was observed in soft coconut logs which had been stocked with female beetles. Monthly inspections lowered survival, and the densest larval populations were obtained in logs left undisturbed
for 4 months after oviposition. About 20 percent
of the grubs reached the third instar (L3) in the disturbed logs, and 50 percent in the undisturbed logs. Even in the undisturbed logs, few grubs were able to reach the prepupal state.
It appears likely that larval mortality has two peaks, initially when the first instar ( L I ) leaves the oviposition frass and tries to feed on harder wood and later when the L:, is unable to accumulate enough fat reserve for pupation. The high incidence of prolonged third instars and under-sized adults symptomizes the second hazardous period.
Mortality caused by predators, parasitoids, and pathogens was less common than that attributable to malnutrition. The only eggs removed by ants or killed by desiccation were those exposed artificial-

DISCUSSION
As noted by Dry ( 1922), larval mortality is high for species of Oryctes and for many other xylophagous insects. H e implied, and I would agree, that this mortality is caused more by various forms of malnutrition than by cannibalism, predation, or infectious diseases. The deficiencies leading to malnutrition and death have yet to be determined, but hardness, high lignin content, or fungal permeation of logs may be involved. Under these conditions, it is quite possible that natural enemies and pathogens have little effect on the dynamics of 0 , rhinoceros populations. Most of the grubs killed by such agents would have died anyway before reaching the pupal stage. Thus, the entomophagous organisms should not be expected to have an important role in controlling Rhinoceros Beetle outbreaks.
In this connection, it is helpful to examine the phrase "breeding site." For 0. rhinoceros, a coconut log can be the site of mating, oviposition, larval feeding, pupation, and adult emergence. However, the site contributes to the perpetuation of the population only when the last stage, adult emergence, is achieved. Less optimal sites, such as a hard new log, an old rotten one, or a heap saturated with Meturr h i z i u ~ nspores, may even serve as lethal traps since the probability of egg to adult survival is low. The
same reasoning applies to any of the outbreak situations described in the introduction. It can also be applied in analyzing the population dynamics of bark beetles, mosquitoes, or any organisms with specialized breeding sites. The quality, distribution,

Ecology of Rhinoceros Beetle 115

and abundance of their breeding locations may determine adult numbers.
Small improvements in the average survival of larvae would explain the post-typhoon increases in Rhinoceros Beetle populations so often observed on Pacific islands. Assuming survival from oviposition to adult emergence is near 2 percent in a stable population: a posttyphoon generation might increase
2% times with an average 5 percent survival in
the numerous palm logs felled by the storm. A population decline would be expected only when preadult mortality exceeds 98 percent.
The identification, and destruction or removal, of productive breeding sites is an essential prerequisite to success in any campaign against the Rhinoceros Beetle. The strategy of control should include pri-

orities based on understanding of Rhinoceros Beetle ecology and behavior. Well-shaded or hidden logs can be left while more exposed stumps and logs are destroyed. Sites known to be accessible but lethal can also be maintained. The final goal should be a population reduction below the level at which economic damage3 can be detected (Hinckley 1966).
