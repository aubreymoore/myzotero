Post-Doctoral Researcher (Insect Pathologist) 

Position Title 

Post-Doctoral Researcher (Insect Pathologist) JOB # RC-18-06 

The post-doctoral researcher will work with a project PI and collaborators to develop effective biological control for the coconut rhinoceros beetle Guam biotype (CRB-G). This recently discovered biotype has recently invaded several Pacific island groups were it is causing damage and mortality of coconut and oil palms. In the past, coconut rhinoceros beetle invasions were successfully controlled by introduction of Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) as a classical biological control agent. However, CRB-G is resistant to all currently available isolates of OrNV. The selected applicant will: 

    Participate in foreign exploration for isolates of OrNV which are pathogenic to CRB-G. Foreign travel will be required. 
    Perform bioassays to evaluate OrNV isolates as biocontrol agents for CRB-G 
    Propagate promising OrNV isolates for autodissemination 
    Author and co-author reports and peer-reviewed publications documenting research results
