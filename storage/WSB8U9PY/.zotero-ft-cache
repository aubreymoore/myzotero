Feeding damage by adult coconut rhinoceros beetles (CRB), Oryctes rhinoceros (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), on coconut palm trees (Cocos nucifera) consist of bore holes, mainly by the use of spines on their forelegs, through the base (petiole) of mature fronds, immature frond spears, and apical meristem (heart) where the beetles feed on the exuding sap. The mechanical boring damage and sucking on sap can result in death of the tree. Observations from October 2015 to July 2016 at United States Marine Corps Pu`uloa Rifle Training Facility, Iroquois Point, O`ahu, indicated that 37.5 to 80% of untreated trees sustained CRB damage. Installation of nylon fish net “collars” (0.25 mm nylon monofilament, 1-inch mesh, 1.5 x 3 ft length) secured to the base of inner frond petioles in tree crowns deterred CRB activity, resulting in damage to 12.5 to 37.5% of net-treated trees; however, monthly adjustments to reposition nets around the base of growing fronds was required. Laboratory bioassay trials indicated that the combination of pyrethroids, bifenthrin (Onyx Pro), plus a synergist, piperonyl butoxide (PBO) (Exponent), was most effective against CRB adults; both products are registered by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for use on coconut trees. Therefore, in the field trial, bifenthrin and PBO were applied to the crowns of palm trees every 4 weeks (based on prior residual field trials) via a PVC pipe delivery system fitted with anti-drift spray nozzles that directed the insecticide only to the growing spear frond. After 10 months, CRB damage among Onyx Pro-treated coconut trees was reduced from 75 to 8.3%.

see above for Treatments 1 and 2

 Field trial conducted at USMC Pu`uloa Range Training Facility, Iroquois Point, HI (Fig. 1); coconut
rhinoceros beetle (CRB) were detected in March 2014
 Treatments assigned to coconut trees (Cocos nucifera) in February 2015 and modified in
October 2015, consisted of pesticide, netting, a combination of pesticide and netting, and an untreated check (table 1, Figs. 2 & 3).
 Observations were taken every 4 weeks by project personnel in a NAVFAC bucket truck from two
months after PVC delivery systems were installed.
• Damage to the emerging new spear and inner fronds, including bore holes to the tree
crown, were noted and photographed.
• Any adult CRB observed in the crowns were removed, and live beetles were transferred to
the laboratory, where they were placed in colony boxes, provided food and water, and observed.

*Average % of trees exhibiting new damage caused by coconut rhinoceros beetles to emerging spear and inner fronds [untreated control (n = 5), Onyx (n-6), Net (n=4)]. Treatments began in November 2015, with first observations reported for January 2016.

We would like to thank Naval Facilities for use of their bucket truck, spraying rig, and the technical support of their personnel, and USMC for access to Pu`uloa Rifle Training facility. This research was supported by USDA, APHIS Agreement 14-85151785-CA.

Onyx with or without netting: Damage by adult CRB was reduced after two monthly applications (above), and continued to be suppressed through 9-mo observation
 Coconut trees treated every 4 weeks with Onyx and Exponent delivered from the ground through their
installed PVC systems incurred less damage from CRB (75 to 10% after two applications).
 CRB damage among Onyx-treated trees decreased from April to July while damage among the
untreated and netted trees increased (Fig. 4).
 Three adult CRB were recovered on or under Onyx-treated trees during the observation period (above);
two beetles found paralyzed in a tree’s crown never recovered, and died within 48 h in the lab colony.

 Coconut palm trees along the northeastern boundary of
the field plot (see 1 in aerial view at right) as well as trees aligned with wind currents from the direction of the NE

boundary appeared to be more susceptible to CRB

damage than trees along the western boundary.
• Live and dead adult CRB were collected repeatedly

from these trees.
 Undetected CRB breeding sites in the predominantly
kiawe or algarroba brush (Prosopis sp.) along the NE

boundary (see 2 at right) are likely sources of CRB adults regularly captured in mass traps deployed by HDOA in the kiawe brush and in an adjacent plot (see 3 at right).

 Monthly applications of bifenthrin (Onyx Pro) with synergist piperonyl butoxide
(Exponent) consistently prevented damage by CRB to coconut palm trees. After 10 months, CRB damage among Onyx-treated coconut trees was reduced from 75 to 8.3%.
