ABSTRACT . Pacific salticids of the genera Athamas, Bianor, Efate, Ergane, Euophrys, Evarcha, Holoplatys, Myrmarachne, Omoedus, Palpelius, Phintella, and Zenodorus are discussed . Eighteen new specie s are described : Bianor obak, Bianor vitiensis, Efate fimbriatus, Efate raptor, Ergane carinata, Euophrys
wanyan, Euophrys kororensis, Euophrys bryophila, Evarcha reiskindi, Holoplatys carolinensis, Myrmarachne edentata, Myrmarachne pisarskii, Myrmarachne edwardsi, Omoedus cordatus, Palpelius namosi ,
Palpelius trigyrus, Phintella planiceps, and Zenodorus ponapensis . Illustrations and distribution record s are presented for all new species . In the widespread species Athamas whitmeei, morphological variatio n on several islands is illustrated . Efate albobicinctus and Zenodorus microphthalmus are illustrated for comparison with newly described species .

Knowledge of spiders from the Pacific Is lands extends back at least as far as Nieremberg (1635) which includes mention of spiders from the East Indies . Later, Walckenaer (1837 ) described spiders from the Mariana Islands , Celebes, Bismarck Archipelago and Tonga . In Die Arachniden Australiens, L . Koch (1871 – 1881) included a number of species that occu r on the islands . Occasional data on Pacific species are scattered in many papers by variou s authors .
Until recently, intensive studies of Pacifi c spiders by spider specialists, or collection s personally obtained by them, have been lacking . Most of the literature published fro m 1900–1950 has been the work of Berland (i n numerous papers) . Since 1950 there have bee n studies by Marples (1955a, 1955b, 1957 , 1959a, 1959b, 1960, 1964), Chrysanthu s (1958, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1963, 1964, 1965 , 1967a, 1967b, 1968, 1971, 1975), Suma n (1964, 1965, 1967, 1970), Levi (1967),

Gertsch (1973), Lehtinen & Hippa (1979) , Lehtinen & Saaristo (1980), Lehtinen (1981 , 1993), Okuma (1987) Beatty & Berry (1988a , 1988b), Beatty et al . (1991), Berry (1987) , Berry & Beatty (1989), Platnick (1993), Gil-
lespie (1991, 1992, 1994), and Benton & Lehtinen (1995) . Most of these have dealt primarily with spiders from the larger continenta l islands (Chrysanthus—New Guinea ; Platnick—New Caledonia) or Hawaii (Gertsch ; Gillespie ; Suman), or with specific taxa (Su man ; Gillespie ; Lehtinen & Hippa ; Lehtine n & Saaristo ; Lehtinen ; Beatty & Berry ; Berr y & Beatty ; Beatty et al.) . Data on the spider fauna of the oceanic islands remain relativel y sparse .
This is the first of a series of papers dealin g with the species of jumping spiders found o n the Pacific Islands and the distribution pat terns of those species on the islands . Except for Wanless's (1978) revision of the genus So basina, very little specifically on Pacific sal-

ticids has been published . However, records of various Pacific salticids are scattered amon g the papers cited above . Berland (1934) liste d 40 salticid species from Polynesia . In later papers, which included other Pacific areas, h e added 15 more . Marples described six ne w species from the Cook Islands, Tonga, Samo a and Fiji . The New Guinea fauna described by Chrysanthus overlaps the fauna of the smalle r oceanic islands only in the case of cosmotrop-
ical or widespread Pacific species (e .g ., Bavi a aericeps Simon 1877, Menemerus bivittatu s (Dufour 1831), and Plexippus paykullii (Aud . 1825)) . A summary of the distribution of salticid species of the Pacific and Indonesian Is lands, based both on literature and study o f large collections, is given by Proszynski (i n press) .
The collections on which this paper is base d were made primarily by James W. Berry, Elizabeth R . Berry, and Joseph A . Beatty (note d as JWB, ERB and JAB in the Material examined sections) in a series of collecting trips : Marshall Islands (1968, three months ; 1969 , three months) ; Palau (1973, six months) ;

Guam, Yap, Truk, Ponape, Taiwan (1973, 1 – 2 weeks each) ; Yap (1980, six months) ; Marquesas, Tuamotu, Society, Cook and Fiji Is lands (1987, six months total) ; and Hawaii (1995, one month) . Specimens borrowed from the Bishop Museum (BPBM) and the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH ) were also examined and are occasionally referred to . We treat here 22 species in 12 gen-
era, of which 18 species are new . We are aware that a few of the newly-de-
scribed species do not fit comfortably in the genera to which they have been assigned . In the present state of salticid taxonomy, wit h over 400 genera (many of them essentially undefined) to consider, we can do no better. For this reason we have included brief descriptions of most genera . These descriptions apply only to the Pacific species of these genera an d may or may not be correct for species fro m other regions . Diagnoses of genera are intended to distinguish only among genera reporte d from the Pacific Island region . Attempting to discriminate among all salticid genera of th e
world is a hopeless task in the current state of

216 THE JOURNAL OF ARACHNOLOG Y

taxonomy of the family . We define the Pacifi c region as including only Micronesia and Polynesia (including Fiji) . The islands of Melanesia, the eastern Pacific, Philippines, Indonesia and vicinity of Australia and New Zealand are excluded . In the descriptions th e genera are categorized by size as follows : small, 2–4 mm total length ; medium, >4– 8 mm ; large, >8–16 mm; and very large, over 16 mm . The anterior, middle and posterior ey e rows are referred to, respectively, as eyes I, eyes II, and eyes III . All measurements are i n mm.
Simon (1901–1903) divided the salticids into unidentate, fissidentate and pluridentat e groups of genera, but even he regarded this division as somewhat artificial. Recent workers (e . g ., Davies & Zabka 1989) show in creasing dissatisfaction with this arrangement . Numerous cases of apparent convergence i n various characters that have been used taxonomically further complicate matters .
In salticids there are currently genera tha t differ in non-genitalic characters but have genitalia of the same form (e .g ., Harmochirus—fissidentate, and Bianor—unidentate) . Likewise, there are species of virtually identical somatic structure but with very different genitalia (e.g ., Coccorchestes and an undescribed Pacific species provisionally assigne d to Sobasina) . Which set of characters should be considered more important for determinin g generic limits is currently moot .
Species limits in widespread Pacific gener a also present a difficult problem. Among the three authors of this paper, there are differin g opinions regarding whether each island or compact group of islands has endemic specie s in many genera . For that reason, we have use d a broader species definition until intra-specie s variation in relation to inter-island variation o f those species can be examined more closely .
To exemplify this treatment we present illustrations (Figs . 1–17) of variation in what we refer to as Athamas whitmeei from several islands . Initially these variants were treated a s separate species ; but, after examination of a number of specimens from each of several is lands, we decided to leave them combined as a single species . There may be more than one species in this genus, but sufficient evidenc e for distinguishing them from each other doe s not exist currently .
Most of the salticid genera recorded from

the Pacific occur also in Asia and/or Australia . Few genera, except for those that are cosmotropical, are common to the Pacific Island s and South America. Of the 42 genera recorded from Micronesia and Polynesia, 10 are restricted to the Pacific Islands (including, i n this case, Melanesia) . We treat two of thes e here (Athamas O . Pickard-Cambridge 187 7 and Efate Berland 1938) .
The holotype and other specimens of Euophrys bryophila new species are in the American Museum of Natural Histor y (AMNH) . Holotypes of the other new specie s will be deposited in the Bernice P. Bishop Museum (BPBM) (State Museum of Hawaii) i n Honolulu . All adult specimens are paratypes unless specifically excluded in the text ; juveniles are not paratypes .
Genus Athamas O . Pickard-Cambridge 187 7
Discussion .—Members of the genus Athamas are widespread in the Pacific region, occurring from the western Caroline Islands t o Henderson Island . Initially several species ha d been distinguished among our material on th e basis of differences in size, color, length o f the tibial apophysis of the male palp, clypeal height, number of spines of the male tibia I and slight variations in the palpal embolus an d bulb . Examination of a number of specimen s from each of several islands showed that mos t of these characters were highly variable on each island, especially size, coloration an d male palpal apophysis . Figures 5–7 sho w some of the variations in epigyna, and Figs . 13–17 show the variations from island to is land in the male palps . The number of tibial spines on the male first leg is correlated wit h the size of the spider and varies overall from 4–7 pairs . A range of 5–7 pairs was found in a few specimens from Kusaie, Caroline Is lands .
The characteristics of tramp species appea r to be well exemplified by A . whitmeei—abundance, wide distribution, a high level of variation and occurrence in marginal areas (e .g . , Eniwetok, a relatively dry atoll on the north edge of the Pacific Island region) . Localized speciation is not expected in tramp species be cause of their effective means of dispersal . Salticidae are known as reasonably effectiv e ballooners (Salmon & Horner 1977) .

Map 1 .—Major island groups of the Pacific Ocean . The three major divisions are (1) Micronesia , including the little islands in the western Pacific and generally north of the Equator (primarily the Carolin e Islands, Mariana Islands, and the Marshall Islands), (2) Polynesia, forming a huge triangle in the centra l Pacific, with 17 different island groups (including Hawaii, Samoa, Tonga, Cook Islands, Society Island s and Marquesas), and (3) Melanesia, including Fiji and the islands to its west (excluding Indonesia) .

ation for several island groups is required . I t is entirely possible that more than one specie s does exist, but until we have stronger evi-
dence we will not describe as species the variation in these spiders that we have seen fro m island to island.
Diagnosis . —This is an unusual salticid genus with an eye pattern clearly of the lyssomanine type (i .e ., arranged in four rows, ALE positioned directly above AME), but the pal-
pal organ is of the euophryine type (i .e ., wit h the sperm duct looping inward (Figs . 15, 16 ) rather than being without convolutions (Figs . 27) . The facial appearance is dominated by huge anterior median eyes (AME) . The leg spination is also unusual : tibia I has 4–7 pair s of ventral spines, three of which are very long , metatarsus I with three pairs of long spine s and tarsus I also with one pair of long spines . The cheliceral retromargin appears unidentat e but has a minute second cusp on the side o f the tooth nearer the base of the fang .

Discussion .—Berland distinguished A . univittata from A . whitmeei solely by the color pattern ("le dessin si particulier") of the unique female specimen . He cited the constancy of color pattern in A . whitmeei as jus-
tification for regarding univittata as a separate species ("donnee la grande fixite du dessin de whitmeei") . Without supporting evidenc e from other characters we are reluctant to recognize more than one species in the genus . Recently Jendrzejewska (1995) described four
new Athamas species on the basis of one or two specimens each . No evidence concernin g intrapopulation variation in any of the characters was presented. One species was base d on a single specimen differentiated only b y the absence of patches of white hairs on th e carapace . These hairs are easily rubbed off, and their absence may be the result of handling . Additional information from DNA or protein analysis could show whether or no t they are different .

Genus Efate Berland 193 8
Discussion. The genus Efate was established by Berland (1938) for the single specie s E. albobicinctus from the New Hebrides (no w Vanuatu), which was also later reported from Samoa (Marples 1955) . Two additional species are described here .
Diagnosis .—Small-to-medium ant-like fissidentate salticids . The only similar genera in

the Pacific are Rarahu Berland 1929 and So basina Simon 1897 . Rarahu differs from Efate by having leg spines only on metatarsus I . The male palp of Efate is of the euophryine typ e (Fig . 38), that of Sobasina is not . In the Efate epigynum the openings are widely separate d (by more than their diameter) and the duct s short (Figs . 36, 37), Sobasina has opening s close together and ducts long .
Descriptive notes .—Ant-like species o f rather uniform appearance about 3-5 mm long . Carapace flattened, low, eye field occupying half of its length, lateral eyes on th e edge of carapace, posterior eyes protruding somewhat . Eye field finely rough and shiny , covered with sparse, minute, colorless adpressed setae . An indistinct line of whitish setae behind eye field and a patch of longer whitish setae at the rear thoracic margin, on each sid e of the pedicel . Pedicel short but readily visible from above . Abdomen long, narrower tha n carapace, broadest just behind the middle , then narrowing posteriorly . Color pattern variable, either two white transverse lines on dar k background or some light and dark areas , transverse areas or lines, related to that pattern . Clypeus obsolete, chelicerae small, thei r length equal to diameter of AME, broad, anterior surface flattened with distinct antero-lateral edge . Promarginal teeth two, basal on e small, triangular, distal one wide and 3-4 cusped ; retromarginal tooth fissidentate . Legs: Legs I have femur and tibia + patella enlarged, with tibia in some forms more strongl y developed, compressed and swollen ventrall y (more pronounced in females), but in males of E. albobicinctus not swollen . Tibia with 5- 6 pairs of ventral spines ; there is usually a ventral crest of two or more rows of long flattene d dark setae, also not developed in males o f some species (E. albobicinctus) . Palp : Of generalized euophryine type with oval, moderately broad bulb, medium length tibia l apophysis and shortened embolus, largely hid den dorsally to bulb, with only end of tip visible. Epigynum : With a pair of round openings, usually widely separated, leading to short ducts which open into nearly spherica l seminal receptacles . A bell-shaped hood between openings except in E. raptor new species .

Efate raptor new specie s Figs . 40-46, Map 3
Holotype .—Male from Fiji, Viti Levu , Lami on tree in field 23 May 1987 (JWB & ERB) (BPBM) .
Etymology . —The name is a noun in apposition based on the raptorial appearance o f the first legs of the male .
Diagnosis .–The raptorial appearance of the first legs, fringe of setae on first tibia and lon g embolus distinguish the male . In the female the slender first tibia without setal fringe and the position of the epigynal openings ventral to the spermathecae rather than lateral to them are distinctive .
Description .—Both sexes similarly shaped . Abdomen elongate oval . Carapace with eye field flat, posterior slope begins shortly be-
hind, no thoracic constriction . Rugosity of eye field so minute as to be practically invisible , profile of carapace slightly different from other species, with thoracic slope beginning just

behind the eye field, without any intermediat e
depression, and sloping diagonally, gently an d without any incipient bulge ; no transverse lines of whitish setae nor whitish spots at the end of thorax . Pedicel short.
Male: (n = 2) . Total length 3 .8, 4 .5 ; length of carapace 1 .8, 1 .9, ; maximum carapace width 1 .0, 1 .2 ; eye field length 1 .0, 1 .1 ; eye row I width 0 .9, 1 .1 . Eyes aligned along their
dorsal rims, ALE's diameter ih of AME, clypeus very low, bare, chelicerae short . First eye row surrounded by thin and very sparse colorless setae ; with no contrasting marks . Thre e stout curved median bristles below AME : two near clypeus edge and one slightly above . Ab-
domen grey. Legs : Leg formula 4-1-3-2; patella-tibia I length 1 .5, 1 .9 ; patella-tibia III length shorter than IV. Legs I brown, leg s II-IV light brownish-grey . Femur I fawn, ventro-retrolateral edge with a dense row of short , stout black setae opposing corresponding ro w of setae on tibia. Tibia I compressed but ex-

panded dorso-ventrally and rounded, making an oval plate, with dorsal surface slightly fla t and with distinct dorso-lateral edges, latera l surfaces dark brown, dorsal and ventral surfaces lighter. Tibia I width 41% of its length ; six pairs of ventral spines ; a thin crest of dense flattened setae, dark and long, on pro lateral side of femur. Metatarsus I thin an d long, with short but robust ventral spines (fou r prolateral and three retrolateral) . Palp : Typically euophryine, with meandering seminal receptacle canal and thin, anterior embolus , twisted into a coil, in this species making only half a circle (Figs . 45, 46) . Cymbium twice as long as the bulb, and slightly longer than tibia ; tibial apophysis slim and short, straight in ventral view, but laterally appears half-crescent shaped .
Female : (n = 5) . Total length 4 .6-5 .0 (R = 4 .72), length of carapace 1 .8-2 .0 (R = 1 .88) , maximum carapace width 1 .0-1 .2 (R = 1 .12) , eye field length 1 .0-1 .2 (R = 1 .10), eye row I width 1 .0 (R = 1 .00) . Ventral aspect generally pale, whitish-yellow . Legs: Leg formula 4-1-3-2 ; patella-tibia I length 1 .5-1 .6 (R = 1 .56), patella-tibia III length shorter than IV . Leg I pale yellow, with some greyish darkening . Abdomen light-grey divided by white line, accented by a white transverse line in th e dorsal depression, on sides turning diagonally . Tibia I cylindrical, with flattened dorsal surface, six pairs of ventral spines but no ventra l crest of setae . Width of femur I 36% of it s length, tibia I 16% . Femur I without row o f strong setae along retro-lateral edge, but some indistinct and sparse setae along that edge . Epigynum: consists of a pair of large but in distinct openings located on the backgroun d of translucent spermathecae ; internal structures consist of two sclerotized chambers followed by a heavily sclerotized, short convoluted duct, leading into a spherical spermathecae . Pores are in two separate parts, also found i n other Euophryinae : a distinct funnel-lik e structure near fertilization canal at the spermathecae producing a tight group of hair-lik e structures reaching center of spermathecae ; also a porous structure (without actual opening visible) in wall of sclerotized entranc e chamber.

Genus Ergane L . Koch 188 1
Discussion.—This genus currently include s three species (Proszyfiski 1990) : E. cognata L. Koch 1881, known only from the type specimen from the Pellew Islands, Australia (Da vies &Zabka 1989), E. insularis L . Koch 1881, from Pellew Islands (type missing fro m the Hamburg Museum which has the types o f Koch's other Ergane species (Rack 1961)) , and E. benjarei (Peckham & Peckham 1907), from Sarawak, Borneo, type location unknown to us . These species are all said to hav e the ocular quadrangle wider behind than i n front (Davies & Zabka 1989 ; Peckham & Peckham 1907 ; Simon 1901-03) . The ne w species described here has the ocular quadran gle narrower behind . It otherwise closely resembles figures of E. cognata in Davies & Zabka (1989) .
Diagnosis .—A large fissidentate salticid with lateral spines on metatarsus I, anterio r coxae separated by more than a coxal diameter, retromarginal cheliceral tooth tricuspid , promarginal tooth bicuspid .
Ergane carinata new specie s Figs.47-5 3
Holotype .—Male from Caroline Islands , Palau, Arakabesan Island, 23 March 197 3 (JAB & JWB) (BPBM) .
Etymology .—The name, carinata, refers to the distinctive ridges on the anterior face of the male chelicerae .
Diagnosis.—Male palp typically euophryine with relatively broad embolus, chelicerae broad and diverging, with diagonal ridges in their anterior apical part ; female epigynum with two oval windows located far anteriorly . Retrolateral cheliceral tooth tricuspid .
Description .—Male : (n = 5) . Total length 7 .8-10 .3 (R = 9 .06), length of carapace 3 .54 .8 ()I = 4 .13), maximum carapace width 2 .8-

Discussion.—This large, primarily Holarctic genus includes also some species of sub Saharan Africa, Central and South Americ a and southern Asia . It is absent from Australia (Davies & Zabka 1989) and has not previously been reported from anywhere in the Pacific region except Japan and New Zealand .
We have several very small species with similar external appearance but differing i n length of embolus and internal structure of th e epigynum. Logunov et al . (1993) recently questioned the diagnostic value of the epigynurn and its internal structure for some species .
Diagnosis .—Small, usually unidentate nonantlike salticids, lacking lateral spines on tibi a
I . Fourth legs longer than others, but all leg s relatively short and not differing very muc h

Genus Evarcha Simon 1902
Discussion . —This large genus contain s some 35 species in the Old World, including nine in the Oriental Region, of which only Evarcha hyllinella Strand 1913 (from Polynesia and Lombok) is a geographic neighbor; but according to the drawing of its epigynum in Strand 1915, it does not seem to be related . On the other hand, Mollica pusilla Strand 1913 from Tahiti, shown in Strand 1915 is apparently an Evarcha, although a different species . Many of the Oriental species have exter-
nally similar epigyna and can be distinguished
only by the internal structure of epigynum . Diagnosis .—Medium-sized unidentate sal-
ticids, usually placed close to the genera Habronattus EO .P.-Cambridge 1901 and Pellenes Simon 1876, which they resemble i n external appearance . They differ by lacking

the palpal conductor present in Habronattu s and having a basal prolongation of the bulb , not present in other genera . The epigynum lacks the central hood found in Habronattus and has the openings larger and further apart
than Pellenes .

Etymology . —This species is named for Dr. Jon Reiskind, an arachnologist at the University of Florida, Gainesville .
Diagnosis . —Palpal bulb round, embolus arising probasally, encircling 1/4 of bulb, tibial apophysis in lateral view broad with top cut diagonally, ventrally thin, pointed ; epigynum short and broad, unusual by chambers of sper matheca extending straight anteriorly, membranous duct broad, making a single coil .

Differs from other Evarcha by its relatively simple spermatheca and ducts . The only Aus-

tralian species, Evarcha infrastriata (Keyser-

ling 1881), has a similar epigynum with rel-

atively simple internal structure ; but the

drawing of it (Zabka 1993) is too diagram-

matic to draw conclusions ; the male palp of

that species differs from the species describe d

below by its much longer embolus, making a

full circle around bulb . Both male and female

of E. infrastriata have a striking, tight cluste r

of stout, curved bristles, below and between

lateral eyes II-III, resembling horns .

Description, Male: (n = 5) . Total length

6.0–7 .0 (R = 6 .59), length of carapace 2 .9 –

1 .57), eye row I width 1 .8–2 .0 (R = 1 .96) .

Carapace chestnut-brown, including eye field ,

lateral eyes surrounded by black, with a light 72 er brown area behind eye field . Fovea small

but distinct, and indistinct darker diagonal

lines radiate from fovea . Slopes of thorax and

sides with indistinct, short, sparse dark setae ,

lower sides with sparse whitish setae . Fac e

light chestnut-brown, eye I rims black sur-

rounded with inconspicuous whitish setae,

clypeus low with sparse, very long uprigh t

whitish setae on darker bases, not making an y

Distribution. —Known only from Palau i n the Caroline Islands .
Genus Holoplatys Simon 1885
Discussion . —This genus was recently revised by Zabka (1991), who recognized six species groups restricted to Australia, adjacen t areas and New Zealand .
Diagnosis . —Very flat, rather narrow an d elongate salticids, 2–11 mm in length, cheliceral retromargin unidentate or without teeth . Cephalic region occupying less than half th e length of the carapace, with two shallow depressions between posterior eyes . First pair o f legs robust . Tibiae of legs I and II usually

without spines . Color pattern variable, from essentially unicolorous to patterns of chevrons, longitudinal stripes or transverse bands . Patterns more highly developed on abdomen than carapace, which is often unicolorous o r with eye region darker. Resembles Ocrisiona Simon 1901 in general appearance and genitalia of both sexes . Differs from Ocrisiona by having cephalic depressions between the PL E and usually lacking tibial spines on legs I an d II (Zabka 1991) . There is some resemblance to Pseudicius Simon 1885 in body shape, especially flattening of carapace and proportion s of length of legs, in shape of tibia I, and reduction of tibial spines . The main differenc e is the absence of a row of stridulatory spines on tubercles under the lateral eyes and the de tails of genital organs and the abdominal pattern .

Holotype .—Male from Caroline Islands , Yap, Yap Island. Fanif, on coconut trunk, 1 1 April 1980 (Virginia Tinnigig) (BPBM) .
Etymology .—This species is named for the Caroline Islands, the only area where the species has been found .
Diagnosis.—Resembles the H. grassalis group (Zabka 1991) in small size, in having a tibial apophysis on the male palp and a lon g thin embolus . Differs from all other Holoplatys species, in the male, by having an almos t perfectly circular tegulum and a very long thi n embolus which makes about 1 1 circles aroun d the tegulum ; in the female, by the relativel y short broad epigynum and distinctive S-shaped course of the ducts laterally . Placement of the species in Holoplatys is tentative .
Description . Male : (n = 2) . Total length 4 .2, 3 .4, length of carapace 1 .7, 1 .7 ; maximum carapace width 1 .1, 1 .1 ; eye field length 0 .8 , 0 .8 ; eye row I width 0 .8, 0 .9 . Carapace low (35–36% of length), moderately broad and long, with eye field shorter than half of carapace, eyes III broader than eyes I, relativel y flat surface of thorax about as long as ey e field . The posterior slope of the thorax is inclined at about 45° . Colored from light-to-dark brown, with lighter spots, which make a distinct pattern, unlike the other species . Covered with setae, rather indistinct, except on sides where they are grouped into horizontal whitish streaks, separated by darker bare lines .

Distribution .—Known only from Palau and Yap in the Caroline Islands .
Genus Myrmarachne MacLeay 183 9
Discussion .—Large genus of ant-like jumping spiders, perhaps the most widely know n taxon with that type of adaptation, containin g 185 species worldwide, of which as many as 108 occur in the Oriental region . Characterized by constant type of palpal organ and rather uniform type of epigynum, as illustrated i n the drawings in this paper. A group of African and Asian species is often considered as genu s Belippo Simon 1910, and the problem of separating these genera or keeping them togethe r requires further study. Identification as the genus Myrmarachne begins usually by mentioning their numerous retrolateral chelicera l teeth, a character rather redundant in view o f the obvious appearance . Belippo has a movable tibial apophysis on the male palp and secondary seminal receptacles in the epigynum (Wanless 1978a) . In Myrmarachne the palpal tibial apophysis is immovable and the epigynum lacks secondary receptacles . Identificatio n of species of Myrmarachne is difficult be cause of particularly uniform characters, an d requires checking of all possible characters : study of stained preparation of epigyna is especially important because of complicate d membranous copulatory ducts, which usually have been overlooked in studies to date . There are no publications covering all Oriental o r Pacific species of this genus, and an older paper on Myrmarachne of the Philippines by

Banks (1930) gives no details of genital organs . The fundamental revision by Wanles s (1978a) is limited to Africa, but description s of several species were given by Zabk a (1985) .
Diagnosis.—The only ant-like pluridentat e genus in the Pacific, distinguished also by th e high cephalic region, constriction between ce-
phalic and much lower thoracic region, slender first legs in both sexes, and greatly elongated male chelicerae .
Descriptive notes .—Ant-like, color dorsally usually nearly uniform reddish-brown , sometimes lightening to yellowish . A pair o f
oblique lateral hair bands on abdomen ½–Y2 back. Carapace unicolorous except for blac k rings and bands around eyes . Legs yellowishwhite with variable brown markings . Frequently a brown prolateral stripe on femur, patella and tibia. Occasionally some leg segments are entirely brown, usually femur, metatarsu s or trochanter.
Carapace constricted and depressed behin d eyes to varying degrees . Abdomen of males with dorsal abdominal scutum, entire or divided into anterior and posterior portions at ab-
dominal constriction . Anterior portion of abdomen often swollen and bulging, higher tha n remainder of abdomen. Females lack scutum and show only a slight constriction of abdomen .
Leg spines are usually present only ventrally on first patella and first and second tibia and metatarsus . Other segments of leg I an d legs III-IV lack spines . Patella I with single spine . Tibiae and metatarsi have two longitu-
dinal rows of ventral spines . Metatarsi almost invariably have two spines in each row. Ventral tibial rows vary from 4–6 per row on tibi a I and 2–4 per row on tibia II. Females tend to average one more spine per row than male s on tibia I-II . Spination patterns vary little fro m species to species .
Genitalia in both sexes are small and rather similar among the various species . Palpal differences between species are relatively slight .
Epigynum shows little detail externally with internal structure more complex, but the significance of the slight variations in coiling o f the ducts is unknown at present . However, one of the authors (JP) believes that it is significant . It is likely that the more complex th e coiling the more variable it is . The species

membranous windows with copulatory openings at posterior edge of windows, broad median ducts leading to a sclerotized posterio r chamber, from where a short diagonal duc t leads to oval spermathecae, located laterally ; entrance duct membranous (according to Davies & Zabka in P. beccarii, that part does not differ from spermatheca) and has a somewha t complicated structure not yet fully understood. Apparently a first accessory gland lead s from entrance duct towards tegument surface ; a second, porous accessory gland located near end of spermatheca .

Palpelius trigyrus new specie s Figs . 111-113, Map 6
Holotype .—Female from Caroline Islands , Yap, Fanif, on coconut trunks, 11 April 198 0 (V. Tinnigig) (BPBM) .
Etymology.—The name trigyrus refers to the three loops of the copulatory duct .

Discussion .—Placement of this specie s with respect to the previous species is uncertain. However, similarity in external appear-
ance of the epigynum, possible relation in internal structure, similar shape of carapace , similarity in proportions of length of eye field , height of carapace, length of flat surface o f carapace, and similar spination of tibia I an d II, suggest that they may be related . Characters suggesting different status are width o f eye fields I and III and length of leg III an d fissidentate cheliceral tooth . Further studies ,
including collecting male specimens, will be required to assign this species properly .
Diagnosis .—Membranous windows of epigynum set slightly diagonally, narrower pos-
teriorly than in Palpelius namosi new species ; copulatory duct long, making three loops (Fig . 113) . The male is unknown .
Description . —Female : (n = 1) . Total

carapace with expanded flattened area, broad oval abdomen . Carapace dark brown with lighter brown flat anterior part of thorax an d an almost black eye field ; all with sparse whitish and colorless setae . Abdomen dark gre y
with yellow spots along bottom of folds, making indistinct pattern (Fig . 111) . Anterior eye s surrounded with orange setae and a few white ventrally ; aligned straight along dorsal-mos t points of their rim, the diameter of ALE abou t 62% of that of AME. Clypeus brown, very low, almost bare, with a row of long white
setae overhanging cheliceral bases . Chelicerae
