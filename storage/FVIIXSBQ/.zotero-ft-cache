Subject Browse

    Subject browse uses CABICODES which are CABI’s own classification codes for broad subjects that would be difficult to describe with keywords alone.
    Each database record is assigned with at least one CABICODE which describes the relevant area of science.
    Click on a subject area to search for all records coded with that CABICODE.
    Open each top category by clicking on the + to see the full array of topics for that area.
    The CABICODE organization is hierarchical so if you click one of the top categories, this automatically includes all its subsections in your search.

Abstract : This full report [ cf. R.A.E. , A 25 294] on a survey in Guam, undertaken in 1936, to determine what noxious insects might be carried by aircraft to Hawaii, contains notes on large numbers of pests on some 20 crops. Those attacking coconut include Aspidiotus destructor Sign., which was injurious in 1924 and 1925, but was controlled by natural enemies such as Chalcidoid parasites and the Coccinellid, Telsimia nitida Chapin. It was found in small colonies on the leaves of coconut, avocado, mango, banana, grape-vine and Citrus and was always accompanied by T. nitida . This Coccinellid, which was described from Guam in 1926 [15 181], has been erroneously recorded as Cryptogonus orbiculus var. nigripennis Weise, in Guam [14 641; 15 417; 17 48, 604; 19 197] and in Hawaii, where it was introduced against Pinnaspis buxi Bch., and readily became established [ cf. 27 367; 28 461]. A Hispid beetle, reported as killing coconut palms on the neighbouring island of Saipan, was described by Spaeth (1937) as Brontispa mañana . It attacks the crown of the tree and appears to have been introduced fairly recently. Attempts are being made to prevent it from reaching Guam.
The most important pests of maize were Pyrausta nubilalis [Ostrinia nubilalis] Hb., Heliothis armigera [Helicoverpa armigera] Hb., Phytomyza spicata Mall., and Aphis maidis [Rhopalosiphum maidis] Fitch. Pyrausta nubilalis which was first observed in Guam in 1911 and was reported to be destroying half the crop by 1925, did not attack any other plant. A Tachinid identified as Ceromasia lepida or Lydella stabulans var. grisescens R.-D. [the species commonly known as C. senilis Mg.] was introduced from Japan in 1931 [ cf. 22 687] and was controlling P. nubilalis satisfactorily in 1936, when the degree of parasitism was usually about 50 per cent. and sometimes much higher. The larvae of Phytomyza spicata feed freely in the leaves of young plants, but less in the new leaves of older ones, possibly because they are parasitized by a Eulophid that occurs in large numbers. They produce as many as 100 narrow longitudinal mines per leaf, chiefly in the apical half, and probably check the early growth of the plants. Severe infestation by A. maidis often occurs in the tassels when they are about to expand, but the Aphid is rapidly controlled by Coccinellids, of which the most important are Coccinella (Harmonia) arcuata F., and Coelophora inaequalis F. Several hundred of the former were sent to Honolulu, but apparently failed to become established. The larvae of Xanthogramma (Ischiodon) scutellare F., feed on the Aphid; 38 undetermined Chalcidoid parasites emerged from a puparium of this Syrphid collected on a leaf of maize.
Sugar-cane is attacked by a number of insects, including the Aleurodid, Neomaskellia bergi Sign., the Derbid, Proutista moesta Westw., and the Delphacid, Perkinsiella thompsoni Muir, which do not occur in Hawaii. P. thompsoni was too rare to be injurious, and its eggs were heavily parasitized by a Mymarid, apparently Paranagrus optabilis [Anagrus optabilis] Perkins. Pests of rice included Susumia exigua Btlr., and Spodoptera mauritia Boisd. Susumia appears to have been present in Guam for some years. It is usually most abundant in seedling plots and injures the young plants considerably; it is sometimes heavily parasitized by the Braconid, Apanteles guamensis Hlmgr., which attacked 66 per cent. of the larvae in one mature field, but was not present in a heavily infested seed bed. Spodoptera occurs in grassland, but causes severe damage to seedling rice in some years. The Ichneumonid, Echthromorpha conopleura Krieger, was bred from the pupae, and on one occasion the percentage parasitism was 22.
Larvae of Prodenia litura F., cause conspicuous damage to the leaves of banana. The eggs are laid in clusters of about 300-400 on the lower surface of the leaf, and though only a small proportion of the larvae reach maturity, their feeding shortens the functional life of the leaves. In October 1936, a colony of the Scelionid, Telenomus nawai Ashm., was introduced from Honolulu, where it effectively parasitises the eggs of Laphygma exempta [Spodoptera exempta] Wlk., and was reared on eggs of Prodenia . It was liberated in various districts, and parasitized eggs were subsequently collected at several places, indicating that it had become established; it also attacked the eggs of Spodoptera mauritia . Mango pests included the adults of a Eumolpid identified as Phytorus lineolatus Weise, which almost completely defoliated the trees and also fed on coconut, breadfruit, grape-vine, sour-sop [ Annona muricata ], avocado, orange and several forest trees. It has been misidentified in Guam as P. pinguis Baly [ cf. 19 197]. Guava is attacked so severely by the Tortricid, Spilonota holotephras Meyr., the larvae of which feed in the new leaves and cripple the growth, that scarcely any fruits are produced, although they were abundant a few years ago.
A list of the pests that occur in Guam but not in Hawaii is appended.
