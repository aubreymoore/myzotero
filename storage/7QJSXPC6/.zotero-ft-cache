HowTo: Open a Microsoft Access .accdb file in Ubuntu
May 20, 2015 Posted by Tahsin Abrar Software Development 6 comments

Recently, I need to run a .accdb file in Ubuntu. I use ubuntu 14.04 LTS version. I tried to run with LibreOffice Base. But failed. And thanks to AskUbuntu. I got the solution from there.

 

We can use the UCanAccess JDBC driver to connect to Access databases (.mdb and .accdb) in LibreOffice Base. Here’s how I did it on a clean install of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

First, I installed LibreOffice Base itself

 sudo apt-get install libreoffice-base  

Then I downloaded UCanAccess to my Downloads folder and unzipped it.

I launched LibreOffice (not Base, just LibreOffice itself)

and chose Tools > Options

On the Advanced tab I clicked the “Class Path…” button

and then added the following five (5) JAR files using the “Add Archive…” button:

 /home/abrar/Downloads/UCanAccess-2.0.9.5-bin/ucanaccess-2.0.9.5.jar /home/abrar/Downloads/UCanAccess-2.0.9.5-bin/lib/commons-lang-2.6.jar /home/abrar/Downloads/UCanAccess-2.0.9.5-bin/lib/commons-logging-1.1.1.jar /home/abrar/Downloads/UCanAccess-2.0.9.5-bin/lib/hsqldb.jar /home/abrar/Downloads/UCanAccess-2.0.9.5-bin/lib/jackcess-2.1.0.jar

Note that you must close and re-open LibreOffice for the new Class Path values to take effect.

Then I launched LibreOffice Base, and in Step 1 of the wizard I chose “Connect to an existing database (JDBC)”

The Access file I wanted to manipulate was named “baseTest.accdb” in my Downloads folder, so in Step 2 the “Datasource URL” was

 jdbc:ucanaccess:///home/abrar/Downloads/baseTest.accdb  

and the “JDBC driver class” was

 net.ucanaccess.jdbc.UcanaccessDriver

In Step 3, I left the “User name” field empty and just clicked “Next >>”.

In Step 4, I saved the LibreOffice Base database as “accdbTest.odb” in my Documents folder.

When the wizard completed it opened my LibreOffice database and I could see the tables in the .accdb file

This solution is collected from here . Thanks Gord Thompson , you helped me a lot.
