Abstract

A microcomputer-based instrument was designed to record and analyze flight movements of individual insects flying through a light beam. In an experiment with Aedes aegypti (L.) and A. triseriatus Say, species and sex of individuals were identified correctly with an accuracy of 84% using wingbeat frequency measurements. This technology may be useful in automated monitoring of flying insects in the field.
