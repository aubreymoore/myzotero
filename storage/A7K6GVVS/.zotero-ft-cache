Setting Up an Online Weather Station

Was asked to set up an on-line weather station for the University of Guam's Agricutural Experiment Station at Yigo, Guam. The weather station is a Davis Vantage Pro 2 Plus on a mast mounted on the roof of a 40 foot shipping container. The container is equipped with internet access via a cable modem. Data is fetched from the weather instruments using a Davis Vantage Pro 2 console fitted with an optional data logger.

Decided to use a Raspberry Pi 3 to read data from the weather station console via USB. Data is stored using weewx software, which also takes care of sending it to Weather Underground. The RP is connected to the modem by a cable.
Step 1: Install weewx on RPi
Step 2: Remove the Fake Clock on the RPi

Following the suggestion in https://github.com/weewx/weewx/wiki/Raspberry-Pi , I deleted the fake hardware clock from the RPi:

  $ sudo apt-get purge fake-hwclock

This forces weewx to wait until a software clock is set from the internet connection before resuming after a power outage.
Step 3: Create a Weather Underground Personal Weather Station and Configure weewx to Feed It

Followed these directions: https://publiclab.org/notes/amysoyka/06-20-2014/how-to-set-up-your-weather-station-and-stream-it-to-the-internet

WU assigned KYIGO4 as the weather station ID.
Step 4: Access Weather Station Online

The weather station is online at: https://www.wunderground.com/personal-weather-station/dashboard?ID=KYIGO4

This page automatically updates every few seconds.

Notes

All outdoor sensors were replaced on April 21, 2017 because the temperature/humidity senor was not working.
