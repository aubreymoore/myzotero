A new species of wasp was recently found on Guam and identified by entomologists at the University of Guam College of Natural and Applied Sciences (CNAS) as Vespa tropica , also known as the greater banded hornet.

These wasps are large and aggressive, which makes them a possible health hazard to individuals with allergies to bees and wasps, as well as children and the elderly.

On July 12, University of Guam research assistant Christopher Rosario discovered a colony of large wasps nesting in a hollow avocado tree.

The wasps were aggressive, resulting in only a single specimen being collected. This observation was posted on the iNaturalist website .

On July 20, Arnold Perez of the LeoPalace Resort delivered five specimens of Vespa tropica to Dr. Aubrey Moore at the University of Guam. Perez discovered a nest and UOG entomologists identified the wasp as Vespa tropica based on publicly available images.

This is a medium-sized to large species. Queens reach 30 mm or more. Males average 26 mm and workers average 24 to 26 mm, which is slightly larger than the diameter of a quarter.

This species is known to attack the nests of Polistines (paper wasps) in order to obtain the larvae to feed their own larvae. It is said to be almost exclusive in choice of prey. However, they sometimes catch honeybees.

The nest of Vespa tropica is usually underground, or in a tree hollow or similar enclosed space. Due to the location, the nest is seldom seen. If excavated, the nest usually appears rhomboid or bowl-shaped, with an open bottom (as opposed to the completely sealed nests of most aerial hornets). The nest envelope is laminar (comprising distinct, broad individual layers) and very brittle.

Found in Asia

Vespa tropica is found in China, Japan, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, India and the Philippines. These wasps raid the nests of other wasp species to take larvae back to their own nest to feed their larvae.

The greater banded hornet has a distinct, bright yellow band around its abdomen. Two colonies have been found on island, one in Upper Tumon and one in Yona.

“Residents of these areas called the CNAS Entomology Lab for assistance because people were getting stung," said CNAS entomologist Dr. Ross Miller. "The sting from this large wasp is very painful."

Miller said both colonies have been destroyed, but since they were found in two different parts of the island, the hornet may already be established on Guam.

"We would appreciate help in knowing if there are other colonies and encourage the public to contact CNAS if they have seen this wasp,” he said.

Call 735-2001 to report a sighting of this new invasive wasp. Be prepared to give your name and contact information so that someone from the Entomology Lab can return your call. Alternatively, residents can email Dr. Miller at millerr@triton.uog.edu .

Invasive species are everyone’s responsibility. UOG urges the public to follow the Guam Customs and Quarantine Agency and Guam Department of Agriculture rules and regulations to avoid accidentally introducing invasive species to the island.

Eradicating or controlling an invasive species takes expertise, time and a tremendous amount of resources.
