Abstract: Introduced mammals are major drivers of extinction. Feral goats (Capra hircus) are particularly devastating to island ecosystems, causing direct and indirect impacts through overgrazing, which often results in ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss. Removing goat populations from islands is a powerful conservation tool to prevent extinctions and restore ecosystems. Goats have been eradicated successfully from 120 islands worldwide. With newly developed technology and techniques, island size is perhaps no longer a limiting factor in the successful removal of introduced goat populations. Furthermore, the use of global positioning systems, geographic information systems, aerial hunting by helicopter, specialized hunting dogs, and Judas goats has dramatically increased efficiency and significantly reduced the duration of eradication campaigns. Intensive monitoring programs are also critical for successful eradications. Because of the presence of humans with domestic goat populations on large islands, future island conservation actions will require eradication programs that involve local island inhabitants in a collaborative approach with biologists, sociologists, and educators. Given the clear biodiversity benefits, introduced goat populations should be routinely removed from islands.

Erradicaciones de Cabras Ferales en Islas Resumen: Los mam´ıferos introducidos son los principales causantes de extincio´n. Las cabras ferales (Capra hircus) son particularmente devastadoras de ecosistemas insulares, provocando impactos directos e indirectos por sobrepastoreo, que a menudo resulta en la degradacio´n del ecosistema y la p´erdida de biodiversidad. La remocio´n de poblaciones de cabras de las islas es una poderosa herramienta de conservacio´n para prevenir de extinciones y restaurar ecosistemas. Se han erradicado cabras exitosamente de 120 islas a nivel mundial. Con tecnolog´ıa y t´ecnicas desarrolladas recientemente, el taman˜o de la isla ya no es un factor limitante en la remocio´n exitosa de poblaciones introducidas de cabras. Ma´s aun, el uso de sistemas de posicionamiento global, sistemas de informacio´n geogra´fica, cacer´ıa a´erea desde helico´ptero, perros de caza especializados y cabras Judas han incrementado la eficiencia drama´ticamente y reducido la duracio´n de las campan˜as de erradicacio´n significativamente. Los programas de monitoreo intensivo tambi´en son cr´ıticos para las erradicaciones exitosas. Debido a la presencia de humanos con poblaciones de cabras dom´esticas en las islas grandes, las acciones de conservacio´n en el futuro requerira´n de programas de erradicacio´n que involucren a los habitantes locales en un esfuerzo cooperativo con bio´logos, socio´logos y educadores. Dados los claros beneficios para la biodiversidad, las poblaciones de cabras introducidas debera´n ser removidas de las islas rutinariamente.

Introduction
Extinction over the past six centuries has been largely dominated by insular species, with non-native mammals being responsible for the majority (Diamond 1989; Groombridge et al. 1992; MacPhee & Flemming 1999). Island vertebrates and plants are vulnerable to the impacts of rats (Rattus spp.), feral cats (Felis catus), and introduced herbivores (Elton 1958; King 1985; Ebenhard 1988; Atkinson 1989; Donlan et al. 2002; Nogales et al. 2004). Feral goats (Capra hircus) are particularly destructive to island ecosystems. The introduction of goats to islands worldwide has resulted in widespread primary and secondary impacts via overgrazing, often leading to ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss (Coblentz 1978; Schofield 1989; Moran 1996; Desender et al. 1999).
In response to these biodiversity threats, techniques have been developed and improved over the past 30 years to remove introduced goat populations from islands (Daly 1989; Parkes 1990a; Veitch & Clout 2002). These techniques are powerful tools for preventing extinctions and restoring ecosystems. Unfortunately many insular goat eradications remain unpublished or inaccessible, creating the perception that eradications are rare. This most likely inhibits progress in island conservation and contributes to the low level of importance placed on the eradication of invasive species in many conservation circles (Simberloff 2001; Donlan et al. 2003b).
We reviewed feral goat eradication campaigns on islands with the primary intent of assessing the approaches, successes, and challenges of these conservation actions to help facilitate future island conservation programs. Data cover most of the world’s insular regions and were compiled using published and gray literature and personal communications with researchers and conservation practitioners. We analyzed key aspects of these eradication campaigns to identify future directions and challenges of island conservation.
History and Impact of Goat Introductions
Goats were domesticated 10,000 years ago in the highlands of western Iran (Zeder & Hesse 2000). Physiological traits such as a low metabolism, an efficient digestion system, and low water requirements allow goats to persist in conditions unsuitable for many other herbivores (Silanikove 2000). These traits, along with a high reproductive rate and general diet, allow domestic goats to thrive on islands as feral populations (Parkes 1993). Goats have become established on countless islands worldwide, generally having been introduced by humans to serve as a food resource.
The earliest recorded goat introduction occurred shortly after 1458 on Selvagem Grande Island in the Madieras (Zino & Biscoito 1994); medieval (approximately AD

Feral Goat Eradication 1363
1000–1300) introductions, however, are believed to have occurred on Holy and Lundy islands in Britain (Munton 1975). During European exploration and colonization before and throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, goats were introduced onto many islands by sailors on long sea voyages. Saint Helena Island, the Juan Fernandez Islands, and Hawaii are but a few well-known examples. Intentional introductions are now relatively rare, although they sometimes still occur on islands used by fishers (e.g., San Benitos, Mexico; Pinta and Marchena Islands, Gal´apagos).
In most cases, biotas of oceanic islands have evolved in the absence of large herbivores. Although equivocal, some evidence suggests that island floras lack adaptations to mammalian herbivory (Carlquist 1974; Bowen & Van Vuren 1997). Nonetheless, it is clear that introduced goats are responsible for wholesale impacts on island floras, including altering the structure and composition of plant communities, causing extinction, and accelerating soil erosion (Spatz & Mueller-Dombois 1973; Coblentz 1978; Parkes 1984; Brennan 1986; Coblentz & Van Vuren 1987; Cronk 1989; Walker 1991; Moran 1996; Desender et al. 1999). Goats remain a serious threat today. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) identified goats as the primary threat to 26% of threatened insular plant species (Lucas & Synge 1978). Further, more recent data indicate that 31% of extinct plant species and 18% of threatened plant species are from island nations (analysis by authors with data from Walter & Gillett 1998, IUCN classification). Secondary impacts are commonplace, such as habitat degradation via overgrazing leading to extirpation of native fauna (Gibbons 1984; King 1985; Desender et al. 1999). Goats are sometimes the exclusive cause of island extinctions (Moran 1996); in other cases they are a contributing factor along with other anthropogenic forces (Maunder et al. 1995; Shimizu 1995; Tye 2000). Biodiversity and ecosystem impacts from introduced goats have been discussed in detail elsewhere (Coblentz 1978; Ebenhard 1988; Courchamp et al. 2003).
Island recovery after the removal of goat populations is often swift and dramatic, even with long-standing goat populations. On Pinta and Santiago islands (Gal´apagos), native vegetation recovered rapidly despite it having been heavily affected by goats over many decades (Hamann 1979, 1993; A. Tye, personal communication). Seedbanks or small populations inaccessible to goats appear capable of preventing insular plant extinctions, and insular plant species often recover demographically once goats have been eradicated (Mueller-Dombois & Spatz 1975; Shimizu 1995).
Island Goat Eradications
Goats have been eradicated from at least 120 islands (Fig. 1; Appendix 1). Areas of islands from which goats have

been eradicated range from 1 to 132,867 ha (Fig. 1). On the majority of larger islands (>20,000 ha), small numbers of goats have been removed from distinct areas. For example, on Flinders Island, Australia (132,867 ha), only 30 goats were present when they were removed in 1994. Similar situations occurred on Auckland Island (45,975 ha), New Zealand, and King (110,075 ha) and Bruny (36,735 ha) islands, Australia (<150 goats were removed [Appendix 1]). In terms of island size and number of goats removed (Appendix 1), the four largest goat eradications completed to date are from the islands of Lana’i

(Hawaii, 36,100 ha), San Clemente (United States 14,800 ha), Pinta (Gal´apagos 5,940 ha), and Raoul (New Zealand, 2,943 ha). A number of unsuccessful eradications have also been documented (Table 1). These campaigns failed primarily because of a lack of political support, inappropriate methods, lack of effort, or the failure to detect the final goats at low densities.
Invasive mammals can be eradicated by trapping, hunting, poisoning, biocontrol, or some combination of these (Veitch & Clout 2002). The most common method used in goat eradication campaigns is hunting, although

poisoning, trapping, biocontrol (releasing dogs or dingos [Canis lupus dingo]), and habitat alteration via fire have also been used (Fig. 2, Appendix 1). Hunting includes the use of hunting dogs, Judas goats (described below), and shooting from a helicopter. Live removal has been conducted on nine islands. Usually, only one method has been used in eradication attempts (mean number of methods used ± SD: 1.5 ± 0.9, n = 69) and the majority of campaigns have not used specialized hunting techniques. Although often not critical for successful eradication on smaller islands, multiple methods—some implemented simultaneously, others sequentially—and specialized eradication methods are requisites for success on larger islands with large populations (Cruz et al. 2005). Workers involved in recent campaigns on larger islands (e.g., Isabela and Santiago islands, Gal´apagos) have improved and developed specialized eradication techniques, including (1) aerial hunting by helicopter, (2) use of specially trained hunting dogs, (3) the integration of GPS (global positioning system) and GIS (geographic information system) technology with eradication methods, and (4) Judas goat techniques (Taylor & Katahira 1988; Isabela Project 1997; Prohunt New Zealand 1997; Campbell 2002; Campbell et al. 2004; Cruz et al. 2005). These techniques rely heavily on technology and highly skilled staff and allow for goat eradications on larger islands within a shorter time period and with increased cost-effectiveness (Caley & Ottley 1995; Campbell et al. 2004).
Hunting dogs and helicopters were exploited in 20 and 13 eradication campaigns, respectively. The use of specially trained goat-hunting dogs increases the ability to detect and kill goats at low densities and in areas of heavy vegetation (Caley & Ottley 1995; Isabela Project 2001). Aversion training eliminates impacts on native fauna from hunting dogs (Tortora 1982; Prohunt New Zealand 1997; Isabela Project 2001). Although it is expensive and requires specialist personnel, aerial hunting is highly effective when removing goats at high densities where open

canopy exists and appears critical for eradications on larger islands with established populations.
A common reason for unsuccessful eradication attempts is the failure to remove the final animals at low densities, because of either the inability to detect them or the selection of inappropriate hunting methods (Table 1). By exploiting the gregarious nature of goats, the Judas goat method is a vital tool for detecting goats at low densities and a monitoring tool to confirm eradication (Taylor & Katahira 1988; Campbell et al. 2004). Radiotelemetry collars are fitted to select goats, which are released and allowed to seek out other goats. Judas goats are then radio tracked, either on foot or by helicopter, and accompanying goats are shot. Judas goats are then allowed to escape to seek out other goats and are then rechecked at a later date. This approach allows the last individuals to be removed (Rainbolt & Coblentz 1999).
Judas goats have been used successfully in a number of eradications: San Clemente and Santa Catalina islands (California, U.S.A.); Kaho’olawe Island (Hawaii, U.S.A.), Ile Malabar and Ile Picard (Republic of Seychelles), Woody Island (Australia), and Pinta Island (Gal´apagos, Ecuador; Allen 1991; Kaho’olawe Island Conveyance Commission 1993; Keegan et al. 1994; Rainbolt & Coblentz 1999; Schuyler et al. 2002; Campbell et al. 2004). On San Clemente Island, where more than 29,000 goats were removed, trapping and helicopter shooting in combination failed to remove the remnant population. The use of Judas goats finally removed the last 263 individuals (Keegan et al. 1994). Recently developed methods involve hormone therapy and sterilization techniques that should improve the efficacy of Judas goats (Campbell 2002). The use of Judas goats should be standard in most goat eradication campaigns to detect the last individuals and as a cost-effective monitoring tool to confirm eradication.
Of the 120 successful goat eradications, 60% (72) were published, 14% (17) are in the gray literature (unpublished reports), and 26% (31) remain unpublished. Although

it is encouraging that more than half of known goat eradications are published, 84% of both published and gray literature papers lack sufficient detail to assess the eradication (e.g., methods, timing, or number of goats removed). Thus they are of little use in future island conservation efforts. Data on costs of eradication programs are completely absent. Incorporating economics into unpublished reports and publications would prove useful. Publishing detailed accounts of both successful and failed goat eradication attempts will help facilitate future efforts (Simberloff 2001; Donlan et al. 2003b).
Approximately 70% of all known goat eradications took place between 1960 and 2003, with the number doubling in the past two decades (Fig. 3). Worldwide, insular goat populations have been eradicated from approximately 567,000 ha (Fig. 3). Because of the relative ease with which goats can be eradicated with recently developed techniques and the clear conservation benefits of eradications, we expect the number of successful eradications to continue to increase in the coming decades.
Challenges and Recommendations
The successful eradication of introduced mammals from islands is no longer a rare event. This is true not only for goats but also for other introduced species such as cats and rats (Towns & Broome 2003; Nogales et al. 2004). Highly skilled specialists and special equipment should be involved in larger or more complex eradications to provide cost efficiency, whereas smaller eradications can be undertaken effectively without specialized personnel and equipment. Goats can be easily removed from most islands of < 500 ha. Large islands, which generally house

more biodiversity, are as feasible but require detailed planning and the use of technology (GPS and GIS systems) and multiple techniques (e.g., aerial hunting, hunting dogs, Judas goats).
Recent island conservation actions demonstrate the feasibility of removing large, established goat populations from large islands. More than 10,000 goats were removed from Raoul Island, New Zealand (2,943 ha, Parkes 1990a). On San Clemente Island, United States (14,800 ha), approximately 29,000 goats were removed (Keegan et al. 1994). With both of these campaigns, multiple techniques were used, including ground hunting, aerial hunting, specialty hunting dogs, and Judas goats. Although each eradication campaign will have unique circumstances, these techniques make up the tool chest of any goat eradication campaign on large islands because they allow for successful removals in years rather than decades. For example, on Pinta Island, Gal´apagos (5,940 ha), it took 30 years to remove 41,000 goats. This was due to lack of continuous effort and limited eradication techniques (Campbell et al. 2004). In contrast, ground hunters removed over 66,000 goats from Santiago Island, Gal´apagos (58,465 ha), in < 3 years (K.C. and C.J.D., unpublished data) because they were aided by extensive planning, integration of GPS and GIS technology, and multiple eradication techniques (i.e., mustering, ground hunting, hunting dogs). Santiago Island should be free of goats by 2006 (a 5-year campaign). With the application of these new techniques and careful planning, funding rather than island size is now the limiting factor in island goat eradications.
Appropriate methods and their cost-effectiveness will vary with animal density, wariness to certain methods, vegetation, and topography (Rainbolt & Coblentz 1999). In an effort to avoid educating animals, a systematic approach is needed in which each method (or combination

Conservation Biology Volume 19, No. 5, October 2005

Campbell & Donlan

of methods) employed removes nearly 100% of the animals that are encountered. Goats rapidly become wary of each method (e.g., finding refuge in caves during aerial shooting), and the use of multiple methods applied sequentially and simultaneously puts educated animals at risk. Switching methods should be based on cost per kill, animal wariness, and timing. For example, it may initially cost more per goat to use helicopter hunting than ground hunting; the use of multiple techniques, however, is likely to significantly shorten the time to eradication.
Once a limiting factor, the problem of failing to detect remnant goats has been solved with Judas goat techniques (Taylor & Katahira 1988). These techniques can be scaled to large islands. On Pinta Island, Galapagos (5,940 ha), 28 Judas goats were used and on Isabela Island, Galapagos (458,812 ha), 600 goats will be deployed (Rainbolt & Coblentz 1999; Campbell 2002; Campbell et al. 2004). Where there is a risk of goat reintroduction (e.g., Gal´apagos; Appendix 1), a long-term Judas goat program allows for detection and removal of reintroduced goats. The threat of reintroductions highlights the need for a long-term conservation perspective with eradication campaigns and the integration of locally based environmental education programs (Donlan & Keitt 1999; Tershy et al. 2002). Of the islands reviewed, only three goat eradication campaigns mention a community outreach or environmental education component.
Judas goat programs could potentially be used on large continental areas. With helicopter-based hunting, introduced herbivores have been removed from large areas in New Zealand (Nugent et al. 2001a, 2001b). Nonetheless, preventing immigration from some distant source (e.g., farms) is considered a requisite for eradication to be a solid management strategy (Parkes 1990b; Bomford & O’Brien 1992). Extensive, long-term Judas goat programs may be a feasible and cost-effective approach to manage immigration and reintroductions. Although large mainland areas may never be completely free of goats, a single intensive hunting effort followed by a long-term Judas goat program could eradicate goats from an ecological perspective.
Goat eradications should be undertaken with an ecosystem perspective because this facilitates additional introduced mammal eradications, if needed, and prevents unexpected changes to other ecosystem components (Zavaleta et al. 2001). Goat removal can have a dramatic effect on vegetation; thus, recovery of vegetation can interfere with completing the goat eradication itself and the eradication of other introduced species. Therefore, to maximize the efficiency of eradications campaigns, goats should be removed as swiftly as possible (Parkes 1990a) and, in many cases, goats should be eradicated after other introduced species. For example, feral pigs (Sus scrofa) were removed from Santiago Island, Gal´apagos, before goats. Simultaneous campaigns, or the reverse or-

der, would have drastically increased the costs of the eradications (Cruz et al. 2005).
Conservation practitioners should take plant and herbivore interactions into account in goat eradication programs (Donlan et al. 2003a). Although benefits to native flora from introduced herbivore eradications have been documented widely (Hamann 1979, 1993; North et al. 1994; Donlan et al. 2002), increases in non-native plants because of herbivore release have also been recognized (Eckhardt 1972; Scowcroft & Conrad 1982; Laughrin et al. 1994; Kessler 2002). Vegetation monitoring and assessments before eradication, particularly on islands dominated by non-native plants, can help avoid unexpected negative consequences of introduced herbivore removal. For example, on Guadalupe Island, Mexico, goat exclosures were constructed to assess the nonnative plant response from herbivore release before the eradication campaign. Integrating eradication campaigns with a holistic ecosystem restoration framework will help increase the efficiency of eradications and prevent potential adverse secondary effects of introduced mammal removals from islands (Zavaleta et al. 2001; Donlan et al. 2003a).
Removing introduced species from islands is one of our most powerful conservation tools. Thanks to improved technologies and techniques, removing feral goats from islands small and large is now feasible. One hundred twenty islands, totaling more than 567,000 ha, have been freed from introduced goats and their detrimental effects; more eradications are being planned or are under way. These include new precedents in island size and number of goats removed: Santiago and Isabela islands, Gal´apagos (58,465 and 458,812 ha), Guadalupe Island, Mexico (26,500 ha), and Great Barrier Island, New Zealand (28,510 ha) (B. Tershy, personal communication; J. Parkes personal communication). Research challenges revolve around detecting and removing goats at low densities, including improving existing techniques (e.g., Judas goats), applying existing technologies (e.g., FLIR, forward-looking infrared), and developing new technologies and techniques. Island size may no longer be a limiting factor in eradication success; rather, sociological factors and funding will prove important in future island conservation actions. Many large islands with goat populations are also inhabited by people who use goats for economic gain, subsistence, or recreation (e.g., Hawaiian and Australian islands). Designing successful eradication programs for multitenure islands will take collaborative approaches involving biologists, sociologists, educators, and local inhabitants—along with a strong political will. This challenge will require substantial financial backing but will ultimately result in tremendous conservation gains. Given the unequivocal evidence of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation caused by introduced goats, they should be routinely eradicated from islands.
