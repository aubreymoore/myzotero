be similar, but the number of chromosomes per cell was much more variable (range, 12-73; 42 metaphase cells). The modal chromosome number of testicular tissues from H. arator was 2n = 20 including an Xy pair - which is characteristic of the Scarabaeidae. The karyotype of DSIR-HA-1179 cells is unstable, with the number of chromosomes becoming more variable with continued propagation.

Abstract Eighteen months after establishment of the primary cell culture, 36 metaphase nuclei of cell line DSIR-HA-1179, derived from the black beetle, Heteronychus arator (F.), had between 32 and 43 chromosomes; one cell contained 67 chromosomes. Structural abnormalities such as double minute chromosomes, ring and di- and tri-centric chromosomes were observed. Thirty-six months after establishment the chromosomes appeared to

INTRODUCTION
Of the 114 insect cell lines listed by Hink (1976) the karyotypes are known for 57. There is considerable variation among the karyotypes which have been analysed. In the Diptera, Drosophila melanogaster Meigen cell lines whose karyotypes have been determined are tetraploid, aneuploid, or a combination of diploid and heteroploid, and cell

lines from Aedes and Culex mosquitoes are mostly diploid or polyploid. In the Orthoptera the cell lines derived from Blatella germanica (L.) (German cockroach) are diploid, polyploid, or a combination of diploid and tetraploid (Hink 1976). Lepidopteran cell lines contain many small chromosomes - in a Bombyx mori (L.) cell line many cells contain over 100 (Grace 1967) - and the number often varies widely within the same cell line.
The stability of karyotypes in tissue from whole insects contrasts with the karyotype variability in cell lines. Yadav & Pillai (1979) found that 145 of 194 scarab beetles studied possessed the karyotype 2n = 20, Xy male, indicating that the normal scarabaeid haploid number is n = 10. Crawford (1982) recently established a cell line from neonate larval tissues of the scarab Heterollychus arator. The karyotype of this species and its cell line DSIR-HA-1179 are reported and compared in this paper.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells
DSIR-HA-1179 cells were grown in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Gibco) in 25 cm2 flasks (Falcon) at 2rC and subcultured as described by Crawford (1982). Haploid and diploid cells were obtained in vivo from the testes of newly emerged H. arator male adults.
Chromosome preparation and staining
DSIR-HA-1179 cells were incubated with colchicine (0.1 Ilg ml- ' of culture medium) for 4 hours, and harvested using trypsin. They were treated with hypotonic 0.075M KC1 fixative for 25 minutes, then fixed with 3 changes of cold Carnoy's solution (methanol: glacial acetic acid, 3: 1 vIv), air dried on slides, and stained with 7% Giemsa (Gurrs Improved R66) for 8 minutes.
The testicular tissue was incubated in Schneider's Drosophila medium with colchicine (0.1 mg ml- ' )for 4 hours, and then teased into small fragments, using fine needles. The fragments were further disrupted by being forced up and down through a hypodermic needle, and were then treated with a hypotonic solution ofKC1, fixed, and stained, as above.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Of 36 DSIR-HA-1179 cells examined 18 months after the primary culture was established, 35 had from 36 to 42 chromosomes (modal number = 37), and one cell contain 67 chromosomes (Fig. 1). The karyotype consisted predominantly of metacentric chromosomes; the number of di- and tri-centric chromosomes, ring chromosomes, and double minutes varied markedly. The karyotypes of 4 representative cells are shown in Fig. 2.
After a further 18 months in culture the cell line chromosome number was highly variable (Fig. 1), but the appearance of the chromosomes was little changed, with the di- and tri-centric chromosomes, characteristics of the earlier analysis, still present in virtually all mitotic figures. Double minute and ring chromosomes were occasionally present.
It is clear that the variability in the chromosome number present after 18 months in culture had increased markedly after 36 months and that chromosome number is of no use as an identification character for these cells. The continued presence of characteristic di- and tri-centric chromosomes, which are normally found only in continuous cell lines is the only distinguishing karyotypic feature of this line. The essentially unstable nature of polycentric chromosomes means that methods other than karyotypic analysis (e.g., serology) should be used to confirm cellular identity.
All meiotic figures of H. aratar testicular cells observed (n > 15) had 10 bivalents (Fig. 3a), the

characteristic number for scarabs (Yadav & Pillai 1979). The sex chromosome bivalent was distinguishable in most cells (Fig. 3a). One mitotic figure contained 9 pairs of chromosomes (metacentric and submetacentric), plus a small acrocentric x, and a tiny y chromosome (Fig. 3b).
We conclude that the cell line DSIR-HA-1179 is, after 36 months of culture, an unstable polyploid with a highly variable chromosome number. The chromosomes of DSIR-HA-1179 cells will be studied in a further 18 months to determine the effect of continued propagation.
