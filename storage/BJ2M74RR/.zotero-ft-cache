Pests in Brief
Coconut rhinoceros beetle. When CRB invaded Guam in 2007, two successful biological control agents were applied: an Oryctes nudivirus to kill adult beetles and a Metarhizium fungus to kill both adults and larvae. 	 Neither biocontrol agent has stopped the severe damage caused by CRB on Guam, however. Not only do adult beetles test free of the virus, they are more damaging and have a different genotype from most other populations in the world. This new genotype, currently referred to as biotype Guam, is also present in Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Hawaii. 	 This new CRB biotype poses a potential threat to the economy and daily lives of Pacific Islanders.

Phakopsora rust. This disease was reported on Oahu, Hawaii in August 2015. It causes premature leaf drop and damaged fruits on Tahitian gooseberry (Phyllanthus acidus). We are highlighting the disease because plants in this family (Phyllanthaceae) grow on most islands and may be susceptible.

Rapid ohi’a death. The fungus identified as caus-

ing the wilt and death of ohi’a trees in Hawaii is

Ceratocystis fimbriata. It is considered a “species

complex,” consisting of several strains or types.

These types may

infect one host

plant or several.

Because of this

variable nature

and broad host

range, it could

pose a threat to agriculture and

A new biotype. The coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros) invaded Guam in 2007 and defied containment and eradication efforts. These efforts included release of the Oryctes nudivirus that weakens and kills adults. Later testing showed that the nudivirus was not effective against the beetles on Guam and that they were a genetically different biotype. This biotype is more vigorous and destructive than the commonly occuring rhinoceros beetle. Recent scouting also noticed they were more likely to reproduce in the crowns of trees, making destroying breeding sites a less effective control.

Distribution. The rhinoceros beetle probably originated in Southeast Asia and was introduced into Samoa in 1911 on a shipment of rubber trees from Ceylon (Sri Lanka). Damage caused by this beetle is usually less severe than the Guam biotype and limited to the notching of leaves, a reduction in yield, and occasional death of young palms. It is found throughout tropical Asia and the Middle East, much of Oceania, and Mauritius and Reunion in the Indian Ocean. The newer biotype Guam has been identified in Guam (2007), Papua New Guinea (2009), and Hawaii (2014). It was recently (2015) reported in the Solomon Islands, but is thought to have been present since 2013. Palau has both biotypes.

Current detection and monitoring methods. If quarantine efforts fail, local inhabitants become the First Detectors. Once identified, traps are set to define the extent of the invasion followed by routine scouting for damaged palms, adult beetles, and larvae. Breeding sites (green waste, coconut logs, etc.) are destroyed or monitored. The fungus Metarhizium anisopliae may be introduced for biocontrol.

(A) Chlorotic rust spots on the upper leaf surface of Phyllanthus acidus. (B) Premature leaf drop caused by the fungus. (C) Rust spots on fruit. (D) Pustules of Phakopsora phyllanthi are produced on lower leaf surfaces.
Distribution. Asia, Caribbean, Central and South America; Reported in August 2015 on Oahu, Hawaii. Hosts. Phyllanthus species reported to be susceptible include: P. acidus, P. benguetensis, P. emblica, P. niruri,
and P. phyllanthi. Other plants in the family Phyllanthaceae grow on many Pacific islands and could be susceptible. For example: American Samoa, Bischofia javanica, Flueggea flexuosa; Guam, Saipan, P. marianus; Palau, Chuuk, Yap, P. kanehirae; Tonga, P. amicorum; Pohnpei, P. cleistanthoides. Impact. The family Phyllanthaceae may contain plants of importance to many island cultures or ecosystems. Their susceptibility to this fungus is unknown. Interest also is increasing for cultivation of Phyllanthus spp. for their edible fruits and for local medicinal uses.

Rapid Ohi’a Death
(Ceratocystis fimbriata)

Courtesy J. B. Friday, University of Hawaii Cooperative Extension Service This fungus usually enters plants through wounds, including those caused by wood-boring beetles, and through roots and root grafts. (A) Typical symptoms of crown dieback caused by C. fimbriata. Leaves usually wilt, discolor, and die quickly, but may remain on the tree for several weeks. (B) If an infection occurs on only one branch of a tree (arrow), that branch will show symptoms of the disease. (C) Crowns of dead ohi’a trees in the Puna and Hilo districts on the island of Hawaii (inset). (D) Stumps of ohi’a in the Puhimau thermal area on Hawaii island.

Hosts. Broad host range includes: cacao (Theobroma cacao), mango (Mangifera indica), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), coffee (Coffea spp.), Eucalyptus spp., Citrus spp, sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea), rubber (Hevea brasiliensis), taro (Colocasia esculenta), dasheen (Xanthosoma sp.), giant taro (Alocasia sp.), arrowhead vine (Syngonium spp.), African tulip tree (Spathodea campanulata), Acacia spp., coral tree (Erythrina sp.), cassava (Manihot esculenta), and ohi’a (Metrosideros polymorpha).

It also causes black, sunken spots on sweet potato tubers and taro corms.

Origin & Distribution. Widespread on a number of hosts. Locally reported from Hawaii (arrowhead vine, taro, ohi’a), Australia (arrowhead vine), New Zealand (sweet potato), Fiji (dasheen), Papua New Guinea (sweet potato, rubber), Independent Samoa (taro).

Impact. (Economic) Wilt and death of woody plants: 50% of cacao plantings affected in Central and South America; severe losses on coffee plantations and citrus orchards in Columbia; major importance in mango and Eucalyptus plantations. (Environmental) Native stands of host trees are not usually damaged as severely as planted species (except for ohi’a in Hawaii). (Social) Species of the plane tree (Platanus) are popular street trees in Europe and the eastern USA and damage caused by this fungus has reduced the aesthetics of towns and cities.
