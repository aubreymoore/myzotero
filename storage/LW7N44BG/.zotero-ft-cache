Deﬁnition of ’Invasive Species’

Invasive species means an alien species whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health.
Executive Order 13112 President William Clinton February 3, 1999
invasive species were previously referred to as exotic pests

Small tropical islands are susceptable to damage by invasive species

no winter no predators, parasites, or diseases: ’escape from natural enemies’

Invasive Species Arrival Rate

Rate of invasive species arrivals is correlated with globalization and containerization.

Kahalui Airport Pest Risk Assessment (KARA)
comprehensive inspection of all agricultural produces was performed on 130 days between September 2000 and July 2001 specimens were identiﬁed to species

125 species of pest insects and 16 plant diseases not known to occur in Hawaii were intercepted at Kahului during the 130 days of KARA inspections 1 new invasive species arrived every day!

Impact of invasive species on Guam
Almost all of Guam’s pests are invasive species One third of the "100 World’s Worst Invasive Species" list published by the IUCN Invasive Species Specialist Group occur on Guam

Impediments to Dealing with Invasive Species on Guam
We suﬀer from the Taxonomic Impediment. Professional capacity is inadequate. Even when we manage to detect invasive species, our ﬁndings are rarely published in the scientiﬁc literature. Arrivals of and impacts of invasive species impacts on small islands are grossly under-reported.

Major Biological Invasions on Guam
Brown treesnake (arrived around 1945) Killed most of Guam’s birds and small mammals. Caused 7 bird extinctions.
Asian Cycad Scale (detected 2003) Threatens survival of Guam’s endemic cycad, listed as the most numerous tree on Guam in the 2002 Forest Service survey.
Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle (detected 2007). Threatens coconut palms, listed as the 2nd most numerous tree on Guam in the 2002 Forest Service survey.
Little Fire Ant (detected 2011) Threatens most animals remaining in Guam’s forests.

Loss of Ecosystem Services Provided by Birds

"Birds are an endangered class of animals ... we must fear that the vital ecosystem services that birds provide - such as the suppression of insect pests - will be lost." says Nyﬀeler.

BTS - Current Status
Millions of dollars per year are spent on preventing BTS from leaving Guam. Some funds are being used for control methods development: snake-proof barriers and "pinkies on parachutes".

Asian Cycad Scale - Current Status on Guam
90% of Guam’s endemic cycads have been killed by the scale and other invasive species Mature plants are protected by the biocontrol beetle, but no natural reproduction is occurring Cycas micronesica placed on the US National Endangered Species List in 2015. (Was the most abundant tree on Guam in 2002.)

Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle - Current Status on Guam
Mature coconuts and other palms are rapidly being killed by an uncontrolled outbreak of CRB-G which was triggered by Typhoon Dolpine in 2016 Damage estimates are not available. History from Palau suggests that we will loose 50% or more of our palms if the outbreak is not contoled. A search for an eﬀective biological control agent, most likely a new isolate of Oryctes nudivirus is under way. If current outbreaks of CRB-G cannot be controled, CRB-G will spread to other islands and possibly the Americas.
