For the ﬁrst time, the ﬂight paths of ﬁve butterﬂy species were successfully tracked using harmonic radar within an agricultural landscape. Until now, butterﬂy mobility has been predominantly studied using visual observations and mark–recapture experiments. Attachment of a light-weight radar transponder to the butterﬂy’s thorax did not signiﬁcantly affect behaviour or mobility. Tracks were analysed for straightness, duration, displacement, ground speed, foraging and the inﬂuence of linear landscape features on ﬂight direction. Two main styles of track were identiﬁed: (A) fast linear ﬂight and (B) slower nonlinear ﬂights involving a period of foraging and/or looped sections of ﬂight. These loops potentially perform an orientation function, and were often associated with areas of forage. In the absence of forage, linear features did not provide a guiding effect on ﬂight direction, and only dense treelines were perceived as barriers. The results provide tentative support for non-random dispersal and a perceptual range of 100–200 m for these species. This study has demonstrated a methodology of signiﬁcant value for future investigation of butterﬂy mobility and dispersal.

1. INTRODUCTION Examining the scale at which butterﬂies navigate and respond to landscape geometry, while in ﬂight, is fundamental to understanding the role played by landscape in the dispersal and survival of populations. For example, isolation of habitat fragments may have detrimental effects on the sustainability of populations within them (Sutcliffe et al. 2003). The size of the effect will depend on the mobility of the species under consideration, the scale at which it perceives the landscape (Taylor 1997; Baudry & Burel 1997; Dover & Fry 2001), and the strategy used to navigate through it. To determine how butterﬂies respond to the landscape, actual trajectories of ﬂying individuals need to be analysed (Conradt et al. 2000).
To date, most information on butterﬂy ﬂight paths has been collected indirectly through mark-release-resight experiments (Hill et al. 1996; Brommer & Fred 1999; Haddad 1999a; Schneider 2003; Wang et al. 2004) or by following individuals visually (Shreeve 1995; Conradt et al. 2000, 2001; Dover & Fry 2001) which is difﬁcult for distances greater than 200 m. Recently developed harmonic radar (Riley et al. 1996; Riley & Smith 2002) has the capability to ‘extend the range of detection far beyond that of human vision’ (Riley & Osborne 2001), and has been used to track individual ﬂying honeybees and bumble-bees over hundreds of metres (Osborne et al. 1999; Capaldi et al. 2000; Riley et al. 2003). The ﬁrst aim of this study was to assess the potential of this radar for tracking butterﬂy ﬂight paths and thus for ﬁlling the gaps in current knowledge of butterﬂies’ inter-patch movement.
The use of radar technology to observe lepidopteran movement is not novel in itself; the harmonic radar was

used to track pheromone-ﬁnding ﬂights of Agrotis segetum moths (Riley et al. 1998). Roland et al. (1996) used a portable direction-ﬁnding radar device, similar to that used on beetles (Wallin & Ekbom 1988), to relocate Apollo butterﬂies up to a range of 50 m through triangulation. However, Riley & Smith’s device (although static) measures range as well as direction and has a superior detection range of up to 1 km, providing a geometrically accurate map of the insect’s trajectory while in ﬂight (Riley & Osborne 2001). One limitation is that it cannot detect insects obscured by vegetation or trees. Aside from areas of woodland, vegetative landscape features in an agricultural terrain are rarely spatially or temporally continuous, and gaps in their structure enable detection of a ﬂight track for several hundred metres.
Having established that harmonic radar could be used to track individual butterﬂies, the second aim of this study was to contribute to the current understanding of the inﬂuence of linear landscape features and forage patches on ﬂight trajectories. Dover & Fry (2001) and Conradt et al. (2000, 2001) visually recorded butterﬂy ﬂights, and together suggest that butterﬂies recognize and respond to landscape features, rather than dispersing at random. Dover & Fry (2001) observed the responses of four butterﬂy species to artiﬁcial visual or physical linear features, as guides between areas of suitable habitat. In general, butterﬂies were found to be more affected by the presence of a physical (3D) than a merely visual (2D) feature in the landscape. Conradt et al. (2000, 2001) gave convincing evidence for the recognition of favourable or familiar habitats by Maniola jurtina and Pyronia tithonus (Nymphalidae) and suggested that these butterﬂies may have a perceptual range of between 100 and 150 m (approximately twice their usual dispersal distance within a favourable habitat). Within this

range, these butterﬂies have the ability to identify habitat and orient their movement accordingly. Using the radar to track butterﬂy foraging behaviour extends these previous studies by providing more accurate measurements of butterﬂies’ behavioural responses to landscape geometry over a larger scale, and direct evidence of whether or not linear features act as guides or barriers to movement.
Aglais urticae (small tortoiseshell) and Inachis io (peacock) butterﬂies were the major species in this study. Both species are widespread and common within the British Isles, capable of migration between continental Europe and Britain, and daily dispersal and foraging can range over several kilometres (Asher et al. 2001). While both species are relatively ubiquitous, A. urticae is more commonly encountered within open agricultural habitats and I. io in sunny open woodland areas (Asher et al. 2001). Single releases were also made of Vanessa atalanta (red admiral), Polygonia c-album (comma) and Vanessa cardui (painted lady).
2. METHODS (a) Transponder attachment To track an insect’s movement using harmonic radar, a transponder must be attached to the thorax in an upright position (Riley et al. 1996; ﬁgure 1). A transponder consists of a 16 mm half wavelength dipole antenna, made of ﬁne copper-coated steel wire with an inductor and Schottky barrier diode in parallel at the centre of the dipole. One end of the transponder is glued into a narrow plastic tube, and attached to a numbered coloured disk, used for marking bees (Opalith-Pla¨ttchen, Thornes, UK). The transponder weighs 12 mg, equivalent to approximately 8% of the body weight of an A. urticae, or 4% of an I. io.
All butterﬂies were caught within 1 km of the experimental arena and stored in an outdoor 2!3!3 m3 mesh cage with nectaring plants and shelter materials, for less than 7 days before use. Each butterﬂy had the scales and hairs removed from the dorsal thorax and was uniquely marked with a combination of coloured paint dots (Liquitex, medium viscosity acrylic) towards the rear of the dorsal thorax. The butterﬂy was then released within the holding cage until the paint had dried. After a minimum of 30 min, the butterﬂy was re-caught and the transponder was attached to the insect’s thorax using a circle of double-sided sticky foam (W.H. Smiths, UK), to hold the transponder in place.
(b) Preliminary behaviour bioassays Behavioural bioassays were conducted, in the controlled conditions of the Rothamsted Research ﬂight room (Poppy & Williams 1999), to determine if the presence of a transponder affected the butterﬂies’ behaviour. Bioassays were conducted

between 09:30 and 17:00 h, in the presence of at least two other non-experimental, healthy adult butterﬂies and a patch of nectaring and larval food plants.
Individual butterﬂies were observed for two consecutive periods of 30 min: in one period with, and in the other without, a transponder. Treatment order (with/without transponder) was chosen randomly for each butterﬂy. An individual butterﬂy was not observed for more than four consecutive 30 min periods, and for no more than six periods in total. Within each 30 min period, duration of walking, ﬂying, and resting, or other activities (components noted) were timed (seconds).
A total of 5.5 h per treatment were conducted. Data were analysed using a log-ratio analysis in which logs of the ratios of times spent walking and ﬂying relative to the time spent doing other activities were calculated and analysed using multivariate analysis of variance in GENSTAT (v. 6.0; VSN International Ltd, Hemel Hempstead, UK).
(c) Field observations The ﬁeld arena was approximately 500!400 m2 of land on the Rothamsted estate (Harpenden, Hertfordshire, UK), including short pasture, harvested ﬁelds and scattered trees. Linear features dissecting and enclosing the arena included hedge and fence-lines, tall treelines (greater than 5 m), ﬁeld boundaries and tracks (ﬁgure 2). Butterﬂy releases were only made when ambient temperature exceeded 13 8C and over 60% of the sky was clear, or when ambient temperature exceeded 17 8C in any cloud conditions unless it was raining (recognized as suitable conditions for butterﬂy activity: Haughton et al. 2003). Wind speed (m sK1) and direction were recorded 2.7 m above ground level at 10 s intervals throughout observations. The harmonic radar was located to allow maximum visibility of the arena (ﬁgure 2). A butterﬂy with transponder attached was transported to the release point in a 30!30 cm2 mesh-covered release box with a clear sliding lid (Conradt et al. 2001), covered with dark cloth. There were two release points within the arena; each consisting of seven patches of potted nectaring plants (Cirsium arvense and Brassica napus), arranged in a hexagonal shape (w50 m diameter). Artiﬁcial linear features (visual guide and wind shelter) connected alternating circumference patches to the central patch. These two experimental arrays were originally designed to investigate the small scale inﬂuence of linear features on insect pollinators (E. Cant, unpublished work).
The release box was placed on the upwind side of the central patch of either release point 1 or 2 (ﬁgure 2). The dark cloth over the box was removed, and the butterﬂies were left to settle for 5 min (minimum). Once radio communication conﬁrmed that radar equipment was operational, the lid to the release box was pulled open with string from 5 m away. The radar dish revolved 20 times per min, emitting a 3.2 cm

wavelength signal. A harmonic of this signal was reﬂected back from the transponder attached to the butterﬂy, allowing movement of the butterﬂy to be distinguished from the radar clutter signal from all the other objects (ground, vegetation, etc.) in the experimental arena. Where possible, the butterﬂy was also followed visually from at least 3 m away. This, in combination with radar tracking, allowed nearly continuous recording of behaviour and identiﬁcation of butterﬂy movements in the arena, even when a butterﬂy was invisible to the radar when hidden behind vegetation (e.g. lying low in grass), or sitting at an angle so the transponder was not vertical (e.g. when feeding from a ﬂower). Butterﬂies were tracked until they were either lost from the arena or were inactive for more than 1 h. In the latter case the inactive butterﬂy was collected and removed from the experiment.
Between the 21 August and 5 September 2002, a total of 33 releases were made of butterﬂies with transponders attached, and 30 tracks were successfully recorded by the harmonic radar. The following individuals of Nymphalid species were released: 17 A. urticae (23 tracks), 4 I. io (5 tracks), 1 V. atalanta, 1 P. c-album and 1 V. cardui. These single ﬂights by the last three species (designated style D) were not included in statistical analysis.
The radar tracks were superimposed onto a digitized outline of the ﬁelds in the arena using GENSTAT, and the occurrence, location and size of looped sections of ﬂights were recorded (loops of track less than 10 m radius could not be resolved by the radar). Flights by A. urticae and I. io were categorized into three styles. Style A had no foraging or looping. Style B ﬂights included foraging and/or looping behaviour. The third style (C) included all ‘non-eventful’ tracks, where the butterﬂy rarely moved more than 50 m from the release site and spent the majority of the time observed motionless on the grass. Total ﬂight distance (m), average ground speed (m sK1), duration (s) and straightness of route (maximum range/total ﬂight distance) were calculated for

each ﬂight, and compared between styles using a one-way analysis of variance (duration and ﬂight distance were transformed: log(xC1)).
Tracks were analysed visually with regards to the potential guiding or barrier effects of the various linear features within the arena. Where a ﬂight path crossed a linear feature, the angle of the ﬂight path (10 m either side of the feature) to the linear feature was measured on both sides of the feature, a difference between opposite angles indicating a response to the presence of the feature. Length and location of ﬂight sections passing parallel to a linear feature, within a 10 m range, were noted.
3. RESULTS (a) Preliminary bioassays The behaviour of both A. urticae and I. io butterﬂies did not appear to be negatively affected by the presence of a transponder during qualitative observations. For I. io there was no signiﬁcant (F2,9Z2.70, pO0.05) change to the butterﬂy’s behavioural activities. Five per cent of time was spent ﬂying with the transponder attached compared with 8% without, and respectively, 30% of time was spent walking, compared with 28% without the transponder. In fact the only mating event observed during investigations involved a male with a transponder attached.
(b) Flight styles Flight styles A, B and C (table 1) differed signiﬁcantly for ﬂight distance (F2,24Z8.66; pZ0.001), ground speed (F2,24Z12.97; p!0.001) and straightness (F2,24Z10.27; p!0.001). The ﬁrst style (A) involved approximately linear ﬂights (ﬁgure 3a) which typically had a high straightness value (meanZ0.65) and the ﬂights were relatively fast (mean ground speedZ2.91 m sK1). From both release points, 9 out of 11 of these ﬂights were in a south/southeasterly direction, towards the nearest

(w100 m) hedge or vegetated fence-line to the release points. These linear features may have been recognized as a potentially suitable habitat, and indeed forage (mainly C.arvense) was associated with both features. However, no style A butterﬂies passing near or over these areas stopped to forage. The second style (B) were the nonlinear, slower ﬂights (mean ground speedZ1.59 m sK1), involving foraging activity and/or looped sections of ﬂight. Loop length ranged from 15 to 160 m (meanZ56 m), and width ranged from 10 to 165 m (meanZ40 m). This looping may additionally function in orientation of the butterﬂy within an area since it frequently occurred in close proximity to the site of release (ﬁgure 3b,d). Style B tracks had low straightness values (meanZ0.38), and a long duration within the visible arena. Flights of this style usually involved long ﬂight distances (table 1). Style C ﬂights, in which the butterﬂies spent the majority of time motionless, had low straightness values (meanZ0.26) and these ﬂights also had the lowest mean ground speed (1.25 m sK1). Style (D) consists of the three ﬂights performed by V. atalanta, P. c-album, and V. cardui, which were very straight (meanZ0.82) and very fast (mean ground speedZ4.79 m sK1; ﬁgure 3c).
(c) Response to linear features In the absence of nectaring plants along linear features (hedge, fence, ﬁeld boundary or farm track), there was no difference in approach and leaving angles; all were greater than 308. This indicates that these linear features did not guide the direction of ﬂight paths, or act as a barrier or deterrent to passage. However, dense trees or tall (greater than 3 m) hedges were generally avoided from a distance of 100–200 m, especially during nonlinear foraging ﬂights (style B) as illustrated by the compilation of three style B ﬂights in ﬁgure 3d, where such features appeared to cause a change in the direction of ﬂights and to channel ﬂights over tree-less sections of fence. When butterﬂies were within a 10 m range of a linear feature, there was no evidence of butterﬂies searching along the features for forage, mates, oviposition or hibernation sites.
(d) Foraging behaviour There were ﬁve patches of forage within the visible arena that consisted of greater than 1 m2 nectaring plants (including the two release points). Ten of the 31 tracks involved a period of foraging; six included foraging at more than one location. Tracked butterﬂies that foraged in these patches were often observed to ﬂy straight and direct towards the forage from up to 100 m away. The majority of
Proc. R. Soc. B (2005)

ﬂight loops (13 of 16 loops) that occurred resulted in the return of butterﬂies to an area of forage (e.g. ﬁgure 3b), though repeated foraging did not always occur on return to the previously visited area.
(e) Response to wind Average windspeed during the observation period was 1.8 m sK1 (range 0.38–3.19). Only 7 of 30 ﬂights ﬂew in a down-wind direction, suggesting that ﬂight directions were not affected by predominant wind direction. Butterﬂies were capable of similar levels of straightness during ﬂight, regardless of prevailing wind direction.
4. DISCUSSION This study has demonstrated the value of harmonic radar for providing novel data about butterﬂy ﬂight behaviour at the landscape scale. Unavoidably, in any vegetationally cluttered landscape, parts of tracks will be obscured from the radar’s ﬁeld of view, but the ability to pinpoint the location of an individual at a range of up to approximately 1 km far exceeds the capabilities of even the most diligent ﬁeldworker. Harmonic radar is most suitable for studies of medium ranging ﬂights (hundreds of metres): at a smaller scale (several metres), the current technology cannot provide a level of accuracy above that of visual observation. Studies of migration ﬂights may beneﬁt from use of harmonic radar to supplement other techniques such as mark resight and vertical looking radar (Osborne et al. 2002; Chapman et al. 2003). We note that two of the style D ﬂights were from highly migratory species (V. atalanta and V. cardui). Both these ﬂight tracks were straight and fast (ﬁgure 3c), and it is possible that these ﬂights were migratory (sensu Kennedy 1986), in contrast to A. urticae and I. io that were searching for forage and hibernation sites at the time of this study.
Despite the small sample size of this pilot investigation, useful observations were made about A. urticae and I. io ﬂight patterns. Firstly, the ﬂights of these two species were classiﬁed into three styles (A, B and C), which signiﬁcantly differed in ﬂight distance, ground speed and straightness. Styles A and B (ﬁgure 3) are very similar to the two types of ﬂight identiﬁed by Conradt et al. (2000). Their type 1 described a directed linear ﬂight, and type 2 included a period of looping ﬂight, recognized as being a systematic searching ﬂight. Although within our dataset only one track out of 30 included a similar pattern of repeated loops returning to the release site, in B style ﬂights, other loops were observed up to 570 m from the release point and the

majority were associated with returning towards a familiar area containing suitable forage plants. Butterﬂies were also observed to be able to perceive and ﬂy directly towards potentially suitable forage habitat. Bell (1991, p. 69) states that ‘when an animal has no information about where resources are located it must attempt to move in such a way so as to optimize its chances of locating resources, but also to reduce the chances of covering areas already searched’. Thus perhaps this looped ﬂight performs an orientation function for the butterﬂies, and this supports a non-random method of systematic searching during ﬂight.
With respect to landscape geometry, there was no linear feature within the study arena that caused a butterﬂy to maintain linear ﬂight along it. Dover & Fry (2001) suggested that more than one element is required to maintain, rather than just initiate linear ﬂight along a feature. The strongest association between linear ﬂight periods and linear features occurred for two ﬂights, where abundant forage (C. arvense) was present along a fenceline. No linear ﬂight was observed along this fence beyond the forage, and the fence was not followed on approach to the forage.
Dense treelines appeared to have the strongest inﬂuence on ﬂight path directions and appeared to have an effect when the butterﬂy was up to a distance of 200 m away. Three times, butterﬂies (A. urticae) changed their direction from heading directly at the treeline to a more parallel path (ﬁgure 3d ). It is also possible that the unsuitable habitats involving dense areas of trees channelled these same three tracks over a section of fence-line lacking trees. Haddad (1999b) noted that butterﬂies preferring open habitat (Eurema nicippe and Phoebis sennae) appeared to be ‘reﬂected’ off forest edges, while habitat generalists (Papilio trolius) were not affected by habitat edges or corridors. This suggests that the ability
Proc. R. Soc. B (2005)

of corridors to channel butterﬂy movement between ‘suitable patches’ will only be effective where surrounding matrix is highly unattractive. Conradt et al. (2000) proposed that M. jurtina (Satyridae) when translocated into unsuitable habitat ‘can detect and orient towards habitat from distances of 100–150 m’. In agreement with such hypothesized perceptual ranges, our data tentatively suggest A. urticae and I. io may be able to identify and avoid unsuitable areas of habitat from up to 200 m and locate potentially suitable forage habitat from up to 100 m. This is an area that deserves further investigation when considering critical levels of habitat fragmentation.
In summary, we have demonstrated the capability of harmonic radar to provide novel data on Nymphalid butterﬂy movement within the landscape. The 31 ﬂights tracked support the notion of non-random dispersal, and search strategies inﬂuenced by landscape features and forage patchiness, but not related directly to wind direction. The components inﬂuencing direction of ﬂight are thus likely to be a complex combination of factors, the weighting of which is likely to vary temporally and between species and sexes.
