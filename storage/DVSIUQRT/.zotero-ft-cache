Create new github repo from command line

4338 views

    github
    shell
    git
    curl

Note: While the below is a great way to do it yourself, hauleth suggested Hub which does all this and more!

Create a new shell script called "git-create"

   #!/bin/sh 

repo_name= $1 
test -z  $repo_name  &&  echo   "Repo name required."   1 >& 2  &&  exit   1 

curl -u  'your_github_username'  https://api.github.com/user/repos -d  "{\"name\":\" $repo_name \"}" 
 

As tchaudhri mentioned in the comments, don't forget to make the above script executable by running chmod +x git-create .

Make sure you save it somewhere on your PATH. If you don't have a directory for custom shell scripts on your PATH, you can save it in ~/bin and then add that to your PATH by editing ~/.bash_profile as follows:

  PATH= $PATH :~/bin
export PATH
 

Now you can easily create a new github repo from with the following command:

   git  create mynewrepo
 

If you assume this command is run from a valid local git repo (or the folder containing what should become the repo) you can add the following lines to "git-create" to automatically add the remote:

   git  init
 git  remote add origin  "https://github.com/your_github_username/$repo_name.git" 
 

git init is safe and won't mess anything up if the local repo already exists.

Enjoy!

Again, Hub recommended by hauleth does all this and more!

    Or you can use Hub which provide some more features.

    As already stated, Hub is a really great library for this kind of thing.

    You can alias the hub command in your .dotfiles like so

      hub_path=$(which hub)
     if   [[ -f $hub_path ]] 
     then 
      alias git=$hub_path
    fi
     

    that gives you the additional github commands

      git pull-request   Open a pull request  on  GitHub
    git fork           Make a fork  of  a remote repository 
                        on  GitHub  and  add as remote
    git create         Create  this  repository  on  GitHub  and  
                       add GitHub as origin
    git browse         Open a GitHub page  in  the  default  browser
    git compare        Open a compare page  on  GitHub

    Some Shell Scripts for github https://github.com/rShetty/Scriptomaniac

    if not using Hub, but instead this method - you still need to remember to 'chmod +x script_name' the script file.
