Recording Synonyms

    According to GBIF GNA Profile Reference Guide for Darwin Core Archive, Core Terms and Extensions : "Synonyms occupy separate lines and therefore also have unique taxonIDs."

    In Publishing Species Checklists, Step-by-Step Guide , there is a good example of how to handle synonyms on page 18. This is a very good, detailed reference.

    Several references indicate that misspellings should be noted in dwc:taxonRemarks . Example: "this name is a misspelling in common use"
