Abstract—The ant fauna of Micronesia as determined from museum specimens and from collections mainly on Pohnpei Island is presented here. Around 111 species are found in the region, many of which appear to be island endemics. Palau, Pohnpei, and the Marianas rank the highest in species diversity, with Pohnpei and Palau being especially rich in apparent endemics. The Bonin Islands and Kiribati are poorly sampled, and our understanding of the ant fauna in the whole of Micronesia could benefit greatly from additional collections. Many new and interesting species are known from single collections or single specimens, even on Pohnpei, which is perhaps now the most thoroughly sampled large island in the region. The Marshall Islands contain mostly pan-Pacific and pantropical tramp species, but there do exist collections from the Marshalls (such as a series of Pheidole minors) that can only be clarified through further fieldwork. All data on specimens examined, collected, and reported, as well as a key to their identification and maps of their distributions are provided.
Introduction and Methods
This study began for me as a few informal collections on the island of Pohnpei. When I discovered that the Insects of Micronesia series (introduction by Gressitt 1954) was still missing a study of the formicids, I attempted to construct a study of just Pohnpei using Wilson and Taylor’s Ants of Polynesia (1967) as a model. Many Micronesian specimens were available at the Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ), and I used that collection to check most of my initial identifications and record previous Pohnpeian collections. After learning that a large portion of the Micronesian specimens was sent to the Australian National Insect Collection (ANIC) in the late 1960s (by E. O. Wilson to R.W. Taylor), I traveled there in 2002. While there, I decided to examine and record all Micronesian specimens, and I did the same back at the MCZ.
In 2003, I retrieved from the Smithsonian archives a typewritten inventory of Micronesian ant specimens created by Marion R. Smith. Included with Smith’s inventory (which I abbreviate as “MRSI” in species discussions and elsewhere) was a piece of correspondence dated from 1959 between Smith and E. O. Wilson concerning their plans to report on the ants of Micronesia. Many of the inventory’s 1,915 collections I had already seen by that time. Of those remaining,

I report them here provided that they are suitably and reliably identified (that is, not species like Cardiocondyla nuda (Mayr), which was the default determination for many members of that genus before Seifert’s revision in 2003) or, even if dubiously identified, they add important new localities or taxa. In the inventory, 66 collections by the botanist F. R. Fosberg deserve a special note in that they include no collecting information, just lot numbers. After examining Smith’s inventory, I traveled to the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) to examine their Micronesian specimens, many of which I had not seen but were listed by Smith.
Collections made during this study were primarily done on Pohnpei between June 1994 and January 1996, during a one-week stay in March 2000, and again while passing through the area in 2002. Most collections were made in Madolenihmw municipality around Ponape Agriculture and Trade School (PATS). This school (closed in 2005) had several acres of cultivated farmland and agroforest, and for 40 years it regularly received students, visitors, and shipments from all over the Western Pacific. Other collections were made on trips to the peak of Mt. Nahnalaud, walks along the rivers above the village of Mahnd, above Keprohi Waterfall, around Lehnpeinpohn Waterfall, in the forest above Salapuk, on road trips around the island, excursions into the mangroves around Nan Madol, and visits to Mall Island on the Pohnpei reef. A few collections were also made on three atolls within Pohnpei State: Ant, which is within sight of Pohnpei Island, Mokil (150 km away), and Pingelap (240 km away). Ant Atoll is only used by passing fishermen and tourists, and some of its islets have feral rats and pigs. Mokil and Pingelap have been inhabited since before European contact. Other collections were sent by friends traveling to the Phoenix Islands (part of Kiribati) and Enewetak Atoll (in the Marshall Islands). Most collections were made using soft forceps, fingers, and aspirators, but many important collections came from Berlese extractions of thick moss, wet leaf litter, rotten wood, and other habitats not easily searched by hand. The bulk of my specimens have been deposited in the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH); type series and problematic forms have been deposited at MCZ.
This report is based primarily upon the inspections of specimens found in museums (“Specimens Examined”) and collected during the course of this study (“Specimens Collected”), although interesting reports of unseen specimens are also included. A number of early reports of specimens I did not find are included here where appropriate, but without the myrmecological resources available today, these reports are often unreliable. A review of previously reported species (as well as important reports on some modern collections I did not see) is summarized in Wetterer (in prep.). This is not to claim that my determinations are the final word; indeed I have tried to point out all cases where taxonomic ambiguity exists, or I had particular trouble distinguishing forms. However, my re-inspection of specimens led to some corrections, including identifying Swezey’s (1942) black Solenopsis as Monomorium, the discovery of the only representative of the genus Myrmecina in Micronesia mixed in with Cryptopone

specimens, and the identification of Micronesia’s only Tetramorium insolens (Smith, F.) specimens among those of T. bicarinatum (Nylander). MRSI specimens not seen by me are noted in Table 4 and the distribution maps only if they add a new area for that species or are the only record in an area before my collections.
As with any examination of collections that span a wide swath of time and space, confusion over place names is inevitable. Table 1 lists changes I made to collection localities where the modern spelling could be reliably deduced; specimens have been left with their original labels, but the data below use new names. Table 2 lists place names that I could not resolve, and they appear with an asterisk (*) in the species discussions. Some of the more difficult names were clarified with the help of Bryan’s (1971) guide, to which I was alerted by D. Buden: Netutu is the site of the Roman Catholic mission on Tol I. (Chuuk) and takes its name from the canal dug by the Japanese; Nofo is a village on Weno I. (Chuuk); Tolenot is a peak on Pohnpei I. and is alternatively spelled Torappennotto San, Pohnlehr, Mt. Not, and Tolenawak peak; and Sadog Tasi (or “Tase”) is a beach on Saipan I.
My lists of specimens under each species are organized by current political units and arranged alphabetically. I have used abbreviations for the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Islands (Is.), Island (I.), Atoll (A.), the individual islets of atolls and associated reef islets of high islands (also I.), and Municipality (M.). The high island of Kosrae is its own state (thus “FSM Kosrae I.”), but other areas, like Chuuk State and Palau have numerous associated atolls and small islands. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is grouped

Comments and Suggestions This name comes from a 1953 collection of Iridomyrmex anceps, similar to a collection from Elato A., Elato I. (FSM: Yap) of the same species. It does not name a collector but has a code number in the form of “M” followed by four digits, as with “Fuasuabukaru” (below). It is probably also in Yap (especially since the Marshalls have no Atolls beginning with “F”), but it is impossible to tell if it is a misunderstanding and misspelling of Falalis I. or Falulap I. of Woleai Atoll, Falalop I. of Ulithi Atoll, or Faraulep Atoll. This name comes from a 1953 collection of Pheidole umbonata that has no collector but a similar code as with the “Falalaulap” collection (above). This name comes from a collection of Monomorium destructor by Beardsley in 1953. It could be Lae Atoll in the Marshall Islands.
Kuchua? Pei? Mt. Chukumong and Mt. Teroken seen to be synonymous, but it is not clear to me if the two are the same as Mt. Tonoken
There is a “Tolomai,” which is in the central highlands of Pohnpei (vicinity of Mt. Nahnalaud), but I cannot be sure if this refers to that place. ?
I am confused by this use of multiple municipalities on the same label, a system commonly used by Japanese collectors. Perhaps it means the locale is between these areas. In some cases, I have seen where one of the localities was crossed out, but, again, I am not sure what that means.

with the U.S. Territory of Guam under “Mariana Is.” The main areas of Micronesia are shown on a reference map (Fig. 16), which corresponds to the distribution maps for species. On the distribution maps, black fill indicates three or more collections seen, dark gray represents one or two collections seen, and light gray is used for certain reported collections I have not examined.
For Specimens Examined, in parentheses after each locale is the additional collecting information, with my comments in square brackets. Collectors’ names have been given two-letter abbreviations detailed in Table 3. Collection dates are shown only as year (with the century removed, if the 20th), unless they are species described in Clouse (in press) or otherwise important specimens. Specimens in the National Museum of Natural History have “NMNH” at the end of the parentheses. For Specimens Collected, most of which were done in Pohnpei State, locales and associated habitat information, methods, collectors, and years are contained in parentheses after the island or atoll, unless new forms, in which case the date is more precise and associated with each area. A summary of the preferred habitat of the species is given in cases where sufficient habitat data are available.
Gressitt’s (1954) introduction to the Insects of Micronesia, although over 50 years old, is still a very useful primer on the geology and ecology of the islands. Micronesia encompasses a wide variety of island types (flat atolls to lush mountains), climates (subtropical to equatorial), and vegetation (e.g., deep rainforest, undisturbed mangroves, grasslands, pandanus forest, coconut stands). In addition, the interplay of island isolation, size, climate, and age creates expected patterns of diversity and endemicity. Palau is somewhat smaller, less mountainous and drier than Pohnpei but is closer to Southeast Asia, and thus Palau has a fauna that is overall more diverse than Pohnpei but without as large a proportion of endemics. Chuuk, which was clearly once a very large island but has progressed significantly toward becoming an atoll, has surely lost considerable terrestrial diversity and endemism as it has eroded and subsided. Chuuk is still more diverse than Kosrae, however, which is smaller, younger, and more isolated. The atolls are numerous and often enormous in Micronesia, especially in the Marshalls and Kiribati, which have no high islands; nonetheless, they have a fauna and flora only a few thousand years old. They stand as gravestones to sunken high islands in their lagoons, many of which were probably points of diversity and endemism like Pohnpei is today.
I identified ants mostly using keys found in Wilson and Taylor’s study of Polynesian ants (1967), Wilson’s studies of Melanesian ants (1958a, 1958b, 1959a, 1959b), and Mann’s “Ants of the British Solomon Islands” (1919) and “Ants of the Fiji Islands” (1921). At the generic level, keys in Bolton (1995b), Hölldobler and Wilson (1990), and Shattuck (2000) were extremely useful. Other Pacific ant studies were also used for identifications (Wheeler 1934, Wheeler 1935, Wilson 1957, Brown 1960, Ettershank 1966), especially ant lists of Guam (Wheeler 1912, Swezey 1942), Saipan (Weber 1950), and Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands (Cole 1949). I also relied heavily on taxonomic revisions

180

Micronesica 39(2), 2007

of four groups: Ponera (Taylor 1967), the Dacitinae (Bolton 2000), Pristomyrmex (Taylor 1965, Wang 2003), and Cardiocondyla (Seifert 2003). Identifications for all species were checked against reference collections at Archbold Biological Station (ABS), MCZ, AMNH, and NMNH. All names follow the taxonomy used in Bolton (1995a). Unless of particular interest at the generic level or associated with workers, I did not examine alates.
Several specimens remain unidentified after this study. I have postulated that some are new species, and I have described them in a separate paper (Clouse, in press). The remaining unidentified specimens are mostly known from single or damaged specimens, and these have been given a code number based upon the date of their first or best collection. Color photos and preliminary descriptions of them are being posted on the Internet at antweb.org, and key features for identification are described and discussed here. Measurements (in mm) and indices are standard for myrmecological descriptions, as are their abbreviations:
TL = total length (when viewed from above) PW = pronotal width (at widest point when viewed from above) HL = head length (when viewed from the front, not including mandibles) HW = head width (at widest point, including eyes) CI = cephalic index = HW x 100 / HL ML = mandible length (straight line from lateral mandibular insertion to
apex) SL = scape length SI = scape index = SL x 100 / HW PL = Petiole length (including peduncle) PH = Petiole height (maximum) DPW = Dorsal petiolar width PWI = DPW x 100 / PL PNI = DPW x 100 / PW PPL = Postpetiole length PPH = Postpetiole height (maximum) PPW = Dorsal postpetiolar width PPWI = PPW x 100 / PPL

To assist the identification of new Micronesian specimens, a taxonomic key for 107 species is provided. In the interest of utility, the subfamilies Formicinae and Dolichoderinae are combined in the key, although a good character for separating them is the hair-fringed nozzle at the apex of the rolled, last sternite of the Formicinae (Fig. 6D). Readers are advised to use the key as a starting point and continue their identifications with the genus write-ups, where more characters and difficult species groups are discussed. The key does not include all suspected Micronesian species, only those workers examined by me, so specimens that fail in the key may be new records. Ultimately, the key should be used to organize specimens until identifications can be confirmed against reference collections.

One collection of specimens labeled as being from Micronesia is not included here for the simple reason that, as suggested by M. Deyrup, it is more likely a labeling error than a true record. I was alerted by J. Wetterer to a vial of specimens supposedly collected by Dybas on Peleliu I. (Palau) in 1948 in which there were specimens of Formica pergandei Emery, as determined by S. Cover. Any Formica in the tropics is strange, and this one is particularly odd in not being one of the several species found in Japan (F. pergandei is from the NE U.S.). Its occurrence in Palau—especially Peleliu Island—right after the end of World War II is slightly believable given the massive influx of American soldiers and equipment with the battle of Peleliu. However, being a slave-making species of other Formica, it is hard to imagine how a Palauan population could make a living between its arrival (as soon as late 1944) and this collection. If Formica are found in Micronesia in the future, they will likely be a Japanese species in the Bonins or the Marianas. They can be recognized quite easily by the ocelli on workers.
Species discussions are arranged taxonomically, but figures are ordered alphabetically (as formatting permitted) and presented at the end of the article.

Results and Discussion
Three species recently collected by J. Czekanski-Moir and A. Olsen of Belau National Museum (Palau) were brought to my attention as this manuscript was going to press, and they highlight the incomplete nature of our understanding of the ant fauna of Micronesia and the exciting discoveries yet to be made in the area. They were examined (by the collectors, myself, S. Cover and G. Alpert) in an unmounted condition (in ethanol) and appear to be new records for Micronesia not incorporated in the key, reports, and statistics below; thus, they should be kept in mind when identifying new material and evaluating the nature of the Palauan fauna. The first species appears to be Pheidole philemon Forel 1910, which has not been collected elsewhere in Micronesia. It is very similar to P. recondita Clouse, in press, in that both have long frontal carinae. However, besides differences in sculpturing details, P. philemon is bicolorous, having a light orange head, mesosoma, dorsal petiole and dorsal postpetiole, the remainder being dark brown; P. recondita is overall blackish orange to blackish brown. The second species appears to belong to Vollenhovia except that the propodeum has small teeth. This may mean it is a member of the newly erected genus Gauromyrmex (Bolton 2003), although the antennae still resemble those of most Vollenhovia (12-segmented with a three-segmented or weakly four-segmented club). The third species strongly resembles Solenopsis papuana Emery 1900, a species previously collected only from Pohnpei Island. However, the antennae have 11 segments, which is wrong at the generic level. Like Solenopsis, the antennae have a strong two-segmented club, and the clypeus appears to be bicarinate and elevated medially, although the latter feature will have to be examined more closely. Some of the specimens identified as S. papuana from

Pohnpei we re-examined in light of the Palauan species, and their determination stands.
The distributions of all species (excluding the three recent additions mentioned above) are summarized in Table 4, and the frequencies of their known global distributions are in Table 5. I examined around 111 species (some genera have an ambiguous number of species) and 37 genera (including the undetermined Basicerotini-like alate). Comparing the number of species known from each area prior to my collections, Palau, Pohnpei and the Marianas are the most diverse and about equally so (59, 58, and 57 species, respectively). The Marshalls and Kosrae, each with 30 species, are probably truly less diverse that the remaining Carolines and the Marianas, but Kiribati and the Bonins, with 19 and 9 species respectively, are clearly just undersampled. The collecting efforts during this study added 14 species to Pohnpei’s ant faunal list, bringing its total to 72.
Twenty-five percent (28 species) of the current Micronesian ant list are not known from other areas and thus potentially endemic to the region. Of these, those known from only a single island are predominantly found on Pohnpei (nine species). Expressed as a percentage of the known ant fauna on the island, Pohnpei still has the most endemics (13%), followed by Palau (seven species, 12%), Yap (four species, 9%), the Marianas (four species, 7%), and Chuuk (two species, 5%). There are no endemic genera.
One phenomenon that is clear from this study is that the Micronesian ant fauna resembles Polynesia’s mainly through common origin, and there has been almost no direct flow of native species between Polynesia and Micronesia. Only two Micronesian species are shared exclusively with Polynesia: Ponera loi Taylor, known only from Guam, and Prionopelta kraepelini Forel, which may be synonymous with P. opaca Emery from Melanesia. This lack of strong biogeographic ties between Micronesia and Polynesia can also be seen in the Pohnpeian flora. Glassman (1952) recorded 80 endemic plants on Pohnpei, and the remainder had a notable Western, not Polynesian, origin. Not counting recent introductions or experimentals, his report shows a flora that is about 26% Micronesian (Pohnpei out to Palau, the Marianas and Marshalls), 18% PanPacific, 17% Pantropical, 37% Asian, Melanesian, or Afro-Indian, and only 9% Polynesian.
As with the flora (above), around 36% of the Micronesian ant fauna appears to be the result of range extensions from the south and southwest, and Gressitt (1954) pointed out that the fauna (insect and otherwise) of Micronesia is so clearly southern or southwestern in origin, it could qualify the islands as a mere zoogeographical extension of New Guinea, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Moreover, he argued subsequently (1956) that the Polynesian Subregion (containing the Micronesian subdivision) of the Oriental Region is really just a “tapering fringe” of the Papuan Subregion with added elements from the Philippine Subregion. In light of the attention paid to the biogeography of the Malay Archipelago, it is interesting to note that Gressitt did not argue that Micronesia is an extension of an Australian region, even though it shares many

species with New Guinea; nor did he distinguish sharply between the Melanesian and Indonesian fauna. Gressitt has shown (1956, 1982) that the arthropod fauna of New Guinea is predominantly Eurasian (“Oriental”) in origin and thus so is that of the outlying Pacific islands. Indeed, Micronesian species shared with Australia are usually also shared with Melanesia, suggesting a common origin, as with Polynesia; only one species, Paratrechina minutula (Forel), appears to have originated from mainland Australia and spread to Polynesia and Micronesia. Even this species, however, is in a genus with a worldwide distribution, and at the generic level no aspect of the Micronesian ant fauna appears to have an Australian origin.
Other than as a filter on this Oriental fauna (which has its uses and does give the islands some commonality), it is difficult to conceptualize Micronesia as a unified biogeographic zone. Only two species—Metapone truki Smith, M.R. and Pheidole recondita Clouse (in press)—seem to circulate exclusively among the Micronesian islands, and then only in certain areas. Although one can generally distinguish the faunas of Micronesia and Polynesia by the fact that the former has several more recently arrived species of a more diverse origin (Gressitt 1954), Micronesian islands are often as far apart or ecologically distinct from each other as they are from outside areas. As a result, their grouping often seems forced. More natural groupings based on the ant fauna might subdivide Micronesia thusly: (1) Palau, Yap, and Chuuk as a direct extension of Indonesia (including New Guinea and the Philippines), with high generic diversity, island endemics in Camponotus other than maculatus-group forms, and the presence of certain genera (Calyptomyrmex, Metapone, and Polyrachis) and species (Pachycondyla luteipes (Mayr), P. atrata (Karavaiev), and Ponera incerta (Wheeler, W.M.)) that may not extend east to Pohnpei or north to the Marianas; (2) Pohnpei by itself as an area containing nearly a full complement of Pacific tramps and pan-tropical invasives, several endemics, but no distinctively western genera; (3) the Marianas as a large, highly disturbed area containing common tramps and rare invasives (Ponera loi and Brachymyrmex obscurior Forel), but also endemics of a typically western nature (Cerapachys, Romblonella, and Camponotus); and (4) Kosrae and the Marshalls containing a wide variety of tropical and Pacific tramps but few if any endemics and low generic diversity. The Bonins and Kiribati are currently too poorly collected to be characterized, but key issues for them are (1) whether the Bonin Islands are strongly allied with the Marianas or better categorized as an extension of Japan, and (2) whether Kiribati will demonstrate a blend of Micronesian and Polynesian elements.
Even these characterizations of various areas within Micronesia should be taken as provisional due to the source area of its fauna and the patchiness of collecting efforts in the region. Supposed endemics could easily be found on neighboring islands (as was Metapone truki in Palau) or in the enormous, relatively unexplored ant fauna of New Guinea, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Because ants are “poor dispersers but excellent colonists” (Deyrup, pers. comm.), species that are relatively rare in their home territory can become major

components of island faunae. All species have an equally low chance of successful dispersal to distant islands, and by the time one does arrive, the island is unlikely to already be dominated by other species. Once successfully landed, the ability of ants to generate new colonies from a single inseminated female makes them effective colonists. Thus, the assemblage of apparently unique Vollenhovia species on Pohnpei could be the result of speciation by one or several ancient Vollenhovia colonists or merely range extensions of undiscovered species from New Guinea and the Malay Archipelago. Compounding this problem is the fact that not only is the fauna of this area poorly known, but some of its dominant genera are also poorly understood, with revisions badly needed in the genera Paratrechina, Camponotus, Hypoponera, and others.
The goal of this study was to record and, through limited collecting, augment what is known to date about the Micronesian ant fauna, but the completion of this task has revealed a great need for further collecting and museum work in the area. Many interesting forms are known from only a single specimen, and several of the most commonly collected forms have poorly understood variation. Additional collecting on Palau is already resulting in new locality records and species, as we would expect from the western islands near New Guinea and Indonesia, but even the heavily populated Marianas have yielded intriguing collections (Romblonella, Pheidole recondita, Ponera loi). My collecting on Pohnpei added several new records, but it also missed interesting forms collected previously. Vollenhovia mwereka Clouse (in press), V. sp. 23031948, and the unknown Romblonella would be important rediscoveries for future collectors there. Chuuk and Kosrae are still undersampled for high islands, and they may hold interesting species for different reasons: Chuuk due to its old age, and Kosrae due to its isolation. The large atoll groups of the Marshalls and Kiribati are, relative to their size, virtually uncollected. Although they are dominated by tramps, several of these species show intriguing distributions, such as Monomorium destructor (Jerdon), which has, oddly, not been collected on Pohnpei, and Pheidole fervens Smith, F., P. megacephala (Fabricius), and P. oceanica Mayr, which have quite patchy and perhaps somewhat mutually exclusive appearances. Some such widespread species also have the potential to be damaging invasives, and tracking their movement through the expanse of atolls in eastern and southeastern Micronesia is important. Indeed, these may be the first stops for Wasmannia auropunctata Roger (Wetterer & Porter 2003) and Solenopsis invicta Buren, should they invade Micronesia as they have so many other places. Hopefully the next phase of myrmecology in Micronesia will bring a new level of detail from modern collections, broad taxonomic revisions, and the use of molecular data.

Specimens Examined
SUBFAMILY CERAPACHYINAE
TRIBE CERAPACHYINI
Cerapachys
Specimens of this genus could be confused with Prionopelta due to the broad attachment of the petiole, postpetiole, and gaster; but the visibility of the antennal insertions when viewed from the front in Cerapachys makes it distinct from any other genera in Micronesia. Within the genus, the two Micronesian species can be identified by the size of the eyes.

Unexamined MRSI specimens: Four collections of males identified only to genus: Palau: Peleliu I. (Dy Hg 45), Ulebsechel I. (Gr 52)
Taxonomic notes: The one available specimen was lost while taking electron micrographs, but I believe it is different from other Cerapachys species. It most closely resembles C. salimani Karavaiev 1925 in overall shape and puncturation; however, sp. 91952 is smaller, redder, and slightly hairier. The next closest species appears to be C. dohertyi Emery 1902, which is larger and has more distinct carina and punctures. Measurements estimated from the SEMs are as follows: HL 1.6, dorsal mesosoma length = 1.86, PL 1.0, anterior PH = 1.04, middle PH = 0.84.

SUBFAMILY DOLICHODERINAE
Iridomyrmex
This genus has only one species in Micronesia, but its overall appearance can lead it to be mistaken for members of Technomyrmex or Paratrechina. However, its small projection on the clypeal margin and lack of any standing hairs on the dorsal mesosoma distinguish it from both.

Tapinoma
Fig. 19 (distribution map for all species combined)
The Tapinoma in Micronesia are very small, grayish brown to yellow ants with thin exoskeletons devoid of standing hairs. They might be confused with small specimens of Brachymyrmex, but the latter has a fringe of hairs around the apex of the last sternite and only nine antennal segments.
Tapinoma is quite unresolved in the Indo-Pacific. At the beginning of this project, I followed Wilson and Taylor (1967) and their designation of two widespread species in the area: T. melanocephalum (Fab. 1793), which has a dark head, yellow antennae and gaster, and scapes that extend past the vertex by a length more than the length of the first segment of the funiculus; and T. minutum Mayr 1862, which is overall brown and has scapes that barely pass the vertex. (Wilson and Taylor also differentiated the species by the size of the petiolar node, but in many specimens the node was not visible and thus not useful.)
From the collections I made on Pohnpei, several specimens did not appear to be either species and were set aside for later work. After seeing many more specimens, I decided to make four groups: those that had a mixture of melanocephalum-minutum scape length and coloration (Tapinoma A or B, depending on which combination) and those I felt confident were one or the other species. Subsequently, work by S. Cover at MCZ reidentified some of the minutum specimens I had seen earlier, and he noticed three distinct morphologies in their reference collection (one form, from the Solomon Islands, has very small eyes and was not noticed among Micronesian specimens). Adding to this uncertainty has been the use by M. R. Smith and E. O. Wilson of what is apparently a manuscript name, maculata, for a small number of alates collected in Yap and Palau.
In addition, reports of indicum Forel 1895 from the Mariana and Marshall Islands (see Wetterer, in prep.) indicate that some collectors have felt this third species to be the best determination for forms that lie outside of melanocephalum and minutum. I have seen an indicum type, and indeed, its round, brown head and

206

Micronesica 39(2), 2007

short, yellow scapes give it a color-scape mixture that might ally it with my undetermined specimens. Still, this appearance is well within the range of specimens in minutum reference collections and most closely resembles some specimens from Ifalik Atoll specimens previously identified as minutum.
This collection from Ifalik (FSM Yap: Iflaik A., Ifalik I., Ks 25-IX-1952) is illustrative of Tapinoma’s problems in the Pacific. One specimen with extended, yellow scapes, dark head, and yellow pronotum was identified as melanocephalum; another, with short scapes and a brown pronotum was identified as minutum. If this collection was actually done in different areas and/or at different hours, then perhaps this little islet is home to two species of Tapinoma, but if these workers were pulled from the same foraging line, then completely different hypotheses about what is happening with Tapinoma in the Pacific are suggested.
I retained my original four-group arrangement but noted the determinations of M. R. Smith and S. Cover where, based on collecting information, it appeared I examined the same specimens. Various determinations of the same specimens are noted in superscript as follows: 1. in MRSI as “melanocephalum,” 2. in MRSI as “melanocephalum-group,” 3. in MRSI as Tapinoma only, 4. determined by Cover as melanocephalum, and 5. labeled by Cover as “minutum?” In general, Smith, and Cover, and I agree: few of what I called melanocephalum specimens were left as just Tapinoma by Smith or determined to be minutum by Cover, and likewise, none of my minutum were determined to be melanocephalum by Smith. For some exceptions, the collection labels were rather unspecific and could have encompassed several different collections (e.g., Yap I. by Goss in 1950).

Technomyrmex
Most easily confused with Paratrechina and Iridomyrmex, this genus is readily identified by the indentation or notch in its clypeal border and the presence of fine (but not stout) standing hairs. The two species of Technomyrmex in Micronesia can be distinguished by the lengths of their scapes, and if specimens of both species are obtained, relative body size and coloration.

SUBFAMILY FORMICINAE
TRIBE BRACHYMYRMECINI
Brachymyrmex
A rare invasive known from only a single specimen from Guam, this genus is most readily determined by its nine-segmented antennae. Other Formicinae and Dolichoderinae in Micronesia have 11- or 12-segmented antennae.

Clouse: Ants of Mircronesia

211

Specimens examined: Mariana Is.: Guam I., Mt. Lamlam (on plants, Ks 57)
Taxonomic notes: Native to Central America and widespread in the West Indies, this species is a reluctant and/or recent exotic in the Pacific. It is found rarely on the three islands in the Pacific with the most extensive human contact—Samoa, Hawaii, and Guam. The status of obscurior as a species distinct from heeri is by no means certain; obscurior is a small, dark, ground-dwelling form, and its designation as a species by Wilson and Taylor (1967) was a “…provisional measure, contingent upon a fuller revision of the large and difficult genus to which it belongs.” That revision is still pending.

TRIBE CAMPONOTINI
Camponotus
Species of Camponotus are larger and more visible than most species, but they are often too agile to collect easily. The genus can be difficult to identify at first, for many species appear quite different from each other. Collections of several individuals may allow one to see the various sizes of the workers— polymorphism being a good character—but for single individuals, the 12segmented antennae inserted away from the clypeal border and the protruding lip at the apex of the propodeum (appearing as a raised point when viewed laterally) are reliable characters in Micronesia. Within the genus, species can be best identified by the shape of the propodeum and petiole in profile, the shape of the head, the pilosity, and, in many cases, the coloration.
Although most species in this genus can be easily distinguished by profile shape, pilosity, and color, I have left two Camponotus species groups as unresolved: reticulatus and maculata. What has been called “Camponotus reticulatus” in Micronesian collections may in fact be bedoti (Wetterer & Bourquin, in prep). The latter species has types from a nearer and more similar locale (Indonesia versus Ceylon) than reticulatus but has also been synonymized with reticulatus and revived more than once. I have not seen type specimens of either, nor do I know the specific characters used by others to separate them. The specimens from Micronesia I examined appear to be conspecific, but a definite appraisal requires an extensive examination of specimens from the entire range.
As for the maculatus group, Wilson and Taylor (1967) drew attention to its problems while discussing C. irritans chloroticus (which they raised to species status) and C. variegatus. The history of this group can be reconstructed in detail from Bolton’s (1995) catalog, but briefly, irritans has been a subspecies of maculatus, which has been a subspecies of rubripes and sylvaticus, the latter of which has been a subspecies of both the former and maculatus; tinctus has been a subspecies of maculatus and irritans, as has pallidus; variegatus was a variety of sylvaticus and maculatus until it, like all the forms mentioned in this group here, was raised to its present status as species. I am inclined to believe that

212

Micronesica 39(2), 2007

Sugarman’s 1972 report of C. variegatus from Kwajalein Atoll (Marshall Is.) is likely a collection of the form with the distinctly marked gaster known from Hawaii, due both to its location and modern determination. However, it could easily be that the following reported specimens are various shades of chloroticus, variegatus, or some of the extremely large-headed forms like C. 1945 (below): Stitz’s 1925 report of C. tinctus var. volkensi from the Caroline Islands (reported in Wheeler, 1935, as Yap (FSM Yap), although I believe that is a misunderstanding of Stitz’s locale “Karolinen (Jap.),” the Japanese-controlled Carolines); Emery’s 1914 report of C. variegatus var. novae-hollandiae (now raised to species) from Palau; and Ehrhorn’s 1939 report of C. maculatus from Kosrae (FSM Kosrae I.).
After examining various forms while trying to determine C. sp. 1945 from Palau, my inclination is that the maculatus group may contain more good species (like chloroticus and eperiamorum) than synonymies. Head pilosity, head color, gastral markings, nodal shape, and mesosoma profile vary extensively but not always continuously. Camponotus sp. 1945 closely resembles specimens in the MCZ collection identified as C. variegatus var. papuana, except that sp. 1945 has a shinier, darker head, steeper propodeum, more pointed petiolar node, and, in the minors, less elongate mesosoma. MCZ specimens identified as maculatus have larger heads than sp. 1945, and they often have light spots on the dorsolateral gaster, which sp. 1945 is missing. MCZ specimens identified as “irritans var. tincta” (now species tinctus) are very close to sp. 1945 in head shape and color but have dense pilosity on the head, which sp. 1945 lacks; conversely, an MCZ specimen labeled “irritans var. pallida” (now also raised to species) is very similar in head shape and pilosity to sp. 1945, but is entirely brown, contrasting sharply with sp. 1945’s deep black.
Finally, there is Camponotus schneei Mayr 1903, the types of which are from the Marshall Islands. As a potential Marshall Islands endemic, this record is intriguing, and as a member of the subgenus Colobopsis, it is not a member of the maculatus group (subgenus Myrmoturba). However, Mayr reports that the head shape is different from most Colobopsis, and the description, while long, lacks figures. The color—major brown-black with a yellowish-red head, yellowwhite gaster segment edges, and rust-red mandibles—is interesting, but given the collection locale, this could easily be an import from Asia, Polynesia or America and not a new species, and the types should be found and examined carefully.

Camponotus sp. 121958
Figs. 2A, 16
Specimens examined: Mariana Is.: Guam I., Yigo (Ks XII-58)
Taxonomic notes: This specimen was damaged in transit—losing its petiole and gaster—between the time notes had been made on its general appearance and the completion of measurements and photographs. Measurements: TL (estimated) 2.6, HL 1.02, HW 0.94, CI 92, SL 1.16, SI 123, PW 0.72, ML 0.38. Antennae 12-segmented, last segment shorter than preceding two. Scape extending beyond vertex by length equal to first two segments of funiculus. Node anterior face shorter but parallel to posterior face. Color: Head blackish brown, becoming orangish at mandibular insertions, mandibles and antennae orange, mesosoma black with orangish coloration around the legs and head, legs completely orange, forecoxae slightly brown basally, and gaster is black with grey stripes (caused by a

216

Micronesica 39(2), 2007

change in coloration of the gasteral tergites to whitish clear along their posterior third). Pilosity: Head is dominated by a large number of long, recumbent, silver hairs, especially between the eyes and antennal insertions and on the clypeus; long, standing hairs emerge on clypeus and frons; mesosoma also dominated by long, silver, recumbent hairs, especially dorsally; longer, standing, bristle-like hairs appear on the posterior propodeum; gaster also dominated by long, silver, recumbent hairs, and scattered, longer standing hairs. Similar Species: This species resembles the morphology of Camponotus rotumanus Wilson & Taylor 1967 but has a darker body and is more hirsute. It has a somewhat wooly appearance due to the large number of long, recumbent, silver hairs over its head, mesosoma, and gaster. The dorsal mesosomal profile is similar to C. reticulatus Roger 1863, but reticulatus does not have the light-colored appendages nor the thick pilosity. Among unidentified specimens examined in museum collections and from digital images, the contrasting orange appendages and black body of this species appear to be a unique feature among similarly shaped and sized species.

Taxonomic notes: Major 1: Measurements: TL 8.2, HL 3, HW 2.83, CI 94, SL 2.3, SI 81, PW 1.67, ML 1.27. Antennae 12-segmented, scape extending beyond vertex by a distance equal to first funicular segment. Node anterior face half the height but parallel to posterior face. Color: Head with orangish tinge on vertex but otherwise pure black, including clypeus and mandibles; scapes black, except yellow at insertions, funiculus mahogany. Black coloration of head extends to anterior dorsal midpoint of mesosoma, but fades to orange at propodeum. Petiolar node light orange (lightest part of body); gaster deep mahogany, with indistinct stripes caused by clear strips on posterior of each tergite. Legs yellow to yellowish orange, tarsi more orange, coxae light yellow (especially middle and posterior pairs). Pilosity: Long, standing, orange hairs on front of head from clypeus up to vertex, becoming less numerous but longer toward vertex and less numerous and shorter around sides of head. Extremely fine, recumbent, silver hairs scattered sparsely but evenly on head and mesosoma; mesosoma with about three dozen long, orange hairs on dorsum, and row of ten similar hairs across dorsal petiolar node. Gaster with numerous, scattered, long, standing, orange hairs. Major 2: Measurements: TL 7.9, HL 2.73, HW 2.63, CI 96, SL 2.07, SI 87, PW 1.5, ML 1.3. Minor: Measurements: TL 6.2, HL 1.77,

HW 1.33, CI 75, SL 1.77, SI 133, PW 1.07, ML 0.73. (Head is mounted separately and half-submerged in glue.) Although body size and mesosoma and petiole shapes of minor are similar to that of the majors, the head is much smaller and narrower. Coloration of the head, too, is distinct, being orange brown through to mandibles and lacking any black. Similar Species: This species is a member of the difficult Camponotus maculatus speciesgroup and resembles several unidentified specimens from the Indomalay region. It appears to belong to a subset of this species complex in which the majors have very large heads, and among those, ones in which the heads are also mostly deep black.

Polyrachis
Few genera can be so easily identified as Polyrachis, even with the unaided eye. Although the behavior, size, and metallic pilosity of the species in Micronesia may make them similar to certain Camponotus, the large spines extending up from the petiole are unmistakable. I have not seen the Micronesian specimens of P. dives, but the confirmation of Hansen’s determination by the pre-eminent authority on this genus (Dr. Kohout) makes my examination unnecessary.

Specimen examined: Palau: Ulebsechel I. (Ks IX-52)
Taxonomic notes: Measurements: TL 4.6, HL 1.5, HW 1.45, CI 104, SL 1.63, SI 119, PW 1.4, ML 0.58. Antennae 12-segmented, scapes extending beyond vertex by more than half their length. Pronotum in profile triangular, bulbous dorsally. Mesonotum and propodeum rhomboidal, propodeal declivity longer than dorsal propodeum and mesonotum combined. Propodeum armed with two spines at dorso-lateral corners, as long as hind coxae and pointing perpendicular to posterior face. Propodeal spiracle halfway down posterior face at posterio-lateral corner. Mesosoma with outwardpointing flange that starts abruptly with a corner in lateral third of anterior dorsal pronotum, out to a sharp lateral corner (inner and outer pronotal flange corners 90 degrees when viewed from directly above), then angled in along dorso-lateral pronotum, breaking at the promesonotal suture, continuing along dorso-lateral mesonotum, breaking again at the metanotal groove, starting again on the dorso-lateral propodeum but almost immed-

iately ending at the start of the propodeal spines. Slightly more than middle third of anterior pronotum and posterior propodeum without flange and gently rounded. Node 4/5 height of propodeum, armed with two spines dorso-laterally almost equal in length to propodeal spines and pointing more dorsally. Color: Body mostly black, legs and gaster fading to dark brown, torulus and trochanter-femur joints orange. Pilosity: Entire body, legs, antennae, and mandibles covered in flattened layer of hair, becoming more dense on the head, dorsal mesosoma, and first gastral tergite; mostly silver but becoming golden in dense areas, especially first gastral tergite, thinning significantly on anterior and posterior node and after the first gastral sternite. Similar species: The lobes along the mesosomal margin place this species in the subgenus Chariomyrma, and the overall shape, size and pilosity of sp. 91952 most closely resemble Polyrachis guerini Roger 1863 and P. foreli Kohout 1989. All three species are black with a dense covering of silver hairs, and all three have a sharp flange along the sides of the dorsal mesosoma. Posteriorly, this flange ends with the propodeal spines; anteriorly, the flange continues along the anterior pronotum but for only about a third of the distance on each side. Where this flange stops on the anterior pronotum, sp. 91952 has its distinguishing character: it stops abruptly on each side, creating sharp corners and edges on either side of the rounded middle third. In other species, the flange diminishes gradually and blends with the rounded edge of the central anterior pronotum.

Paratrechina
Paratrechina specimens are much easier to determine at the generic level than among species. Thick, dark, standing hairs are present on the dorsal mesosoma regardless of whether they are small and yellow, like P. minutula, or spindly and dark gray, as with P. longicornis. The clypeal margin varies but never forms a notch or tooth. Between species, two are easily identified— minutula and longicornis—but vaga, bourbonica, and clandestina are best distinguished by the pilosity of their lateral mesosoma and propodeum, characters that require good magnification and lighting to see.

SUBFAMILY MYRMICINAE
TRIBE BASICEROTINI
Eurhopalothrix
Although closely related to the Dacetini (Pyramica and Stumigenys), this genus is much larger and has seven (instead of six) antennal segments in Micronesia. The odd male from Chuuk requires any collection of Basicerotini from the area to be carefully determined.

TRIBE CREMATOGASTERINI
Crematogaster
The taxonomy of Crematogaster species in Micronesia is unclear, but their heart-shaped gasters with a dorsal petiolar attachment make this genus easy to identify, even in the field.
The Crematogaster specimens collected on Pohnpei appear to be only two species, both extremely small and yellow but readily distinguished by the presence or absence of a stout hair at the dorsal base of each propodeal spine. Based on museum collections and the original description (Emery 1901, which includes a figure), specimens without such a hair appear to be fritzi. As for the other, only comparison with types can resolve its identity, although I here offer thoughts on the two most promising possibilities, biroi Mayr 1897 and emeryi Forel 1907. Both species have been reported from Micronesia, but I have noticed that museum collections of both species contain mixtures of at least four small, yellow species with and without propodeal spine hairs. Adding to the confusion, emeryi was originally named as biroi by Emery in 1900. Although I found museum specimens labeled emeryi that match Micronesian ones, and despite seeing a propodeal spine hair in Emery’s original figure of emeryi, I am inclined to consider the Micronesian specimens biroi based on the original descriptions: Mayr describes biroi as simply yellow, while Emery described emeryi as having, oddly, a black head and gaster (“Flava, capite (exceptis mandibulis et antennis) gastereque nigris …”), coloration possessed by none of the specimens I examined.

TRIBE DACETINI
Pyramica
Miniscule species with heart-shaped heads and short antennae can readily be identified as the Dacetini, and distinguishing between Pyramica and Strumigenys can be done easily by noticing the mandibles: Pyramica have stout, triangular mandibles lined with teeth, while Strumigenys have long, thin mandibles with teeth only on the ends. With Pyramica, the size of the eyes and the large lateral hair on the head (reduced and missing, respectively, in P. membranifera) are good characters for identification.

Strumigenys
With long, thin mandibles, heart-shaped heads, reduced antennal segments, and overall tiny size, this genus is rather easily identified (the first character distinguishing it from Pyramica). Within the genus, the six species in Micronesia are not as difficult to determine as it might appear in the key. Mandibular tooth morphology, antennal segments, and presence, absence, and placement of spongy material separate most species, and then body size and pilosity can be used to distinguish S. godeffroyi from S. frivaldskyi.

TRIBE FORMICOXENINI
Cardiocondyla
The Cardiocondyla appear in the key above only after the elimination of various genera through the recognition of certain character combinations, so determining them to genus can be difficult. However, their lack of an antennal club distinguishes them quite readily from those with a distinct antennal club (Monomorium, Solenopsis, Carebara, and Pheidole), their lack of standing hairs on the dorsum separate them from Tetramorium, and their propodeal spines prevent confusion with Vollenhovia.
The taxonomy of Pacific Cardiocondyla has been greatly advanced by Seifert (2003), who included a number of Micronesian specimens in his revision of the genus, as well as determined specimens sent by me. Swezey (1942) was uncertain of his identification of certain specimens from Guam as C. emeryi, and it seems clear now that Micronesian determinations of emeryi are actually tjibodana, which is very similar. Important distinctions of tjibodana are that it has a flat postpetiolar sternum, a postpetiole with a maximum height less than that of the petiole, and stubby propodeal spines. One specimen that was not examined by Seifert was the nuda alate collected by Adams from Mt. Dolotomw on Pohnpei I. (below); it resembles nuda in most respects and was originally determined as such, but it is extremely dark and has a nearly flat postpetiolar sternite. About the post-petiolar sternite, couplet 49 will surely cause problems for those already familiar with nuda, since in the Pacific region, it bulges much more than in specimens from other regions (to a degree that it resembles paranuda, Seifert 2003). Consequently, specimens of kagutsuchi with slightly convex postpetiolar sternites can easily be keyed to nuda, and so the relative heights of the petiole and postpetiole should also be used.

Romblonella
This genus is quite distinct in being rather large, having extremely long propodeal spines and standing hairs on the dorsal mesosoma, but lacking a petiolar peduncle and the distinct modification of the clypeus around the antennal insertions found in Tetramorium. Named for an island group in the Philippines between Luzon and Mindanao, this genus is represented by at least four species in Micronesia. Despite Marion Smith’s work on this genus, especially in Micronesia, (1953b, c), uncertainties remain about the taxonomy of Romblonella in this area, and little progress will be made without more collections.

Fig. 19
Specimen examined: Mariana Is.: Saipan I., Tapocho* (Ya&Yo 6-V-40)
Taxonomic notes: Measurements: TL 2.63, HL 0.88, HW 0.9, CI 103, SL 0.53, SI 58, PW 0.63, ML 0.43. Antennae 12-segmented with distinct threesegmented club comprised of two segments of equal length and a final segment equal to the previous two combined. Color: Overall black, contrasting with brownish orange legs and antennae (including full scapes and coxae). Pilosity: Entire body except posterior propodeum, but including mandibles, clypeus, antennae, legs, propodeal spines, and gaster with fairly straight, evenly spaced, standing silver hairs; hairs spaced from 1/2 to slightly more than their length from each other, fewer on dorsal gaster, more on legs and antennae, becoming more depressed and furlike on funiculus, especially on club. Sculpturing: Head and mesosoma covered in irregular linear rugae and shallow punctures; punctures less visible on clypeus; rugae absent from scrobes; sculpturing more reticular on vertex, down sides of head, and between eyes and antennal insertions; mandibles with longitudinal grooves from insertions to apices. Rugae less distinct on mesosoma, more reticulate on pronotum, longitudinal laterally fading posteriorly; area directly under and between spine bases smooth. Dorsal gaster with fine punctures. Similar species: At first glance, sp. 6051940 appears to be a dark specimen of Romblonella townesi Smith M. R. 1953 (b) (townesi is light brown and sp. 6051940 is black), since they are nearly identical in size and sculpturing and are both from the Marianas (although townesi is from Tinian I. and sp. 6051940 from Saipan I.). However, the propodeal spines of sp. 6051940 are slightly twisted such that when viewed from a 45º angle from dorsal, they are clearly curved; townesi’s spines are straight when viewed at the same angle. This species does not closely resemble other Micronesian species: its spines are too short and sculpturing too fine for R. yapensis Smith M. R. 1953 (b), and it is too small and round, and its spines are too short to be R. palauensis Smith M. R. 1953 (c). It resembles R. opaca Smith, F. 1861, but sp. 6051940’s sculpturing is not nearly as reticulate.

It seems clear that in 1953, Romblonella specimens were in motion, both figuratively and literally, and M. R. Smith had specimens he could not assign to the three species he named. Although he implies his Yapese males were not R. yapensis, and he identifies Pohnpeian workers in his inventory as R. yapensis, it seems likely the opposite in both cases is true; I have left them here, though, as simply two potentially new Romblonella species.

TRIBE METAPONINI
Metapone
This genus can be readily identified by the presence of deep antennal scrobes hidden by wide, flange-like carinae which give the head a rectangular appearance from the front. The absence of propodeal spines and a flat dorsal

234

Micronesica 39(2), 2007

mesonotum give it an overall resemblance to Vollenhovia, but Metapone lacks the distinctive keel on the ventral petiole.

Fig. 17
Specimens examined: FSM Chuuk: Dublon I. (worker and two queens, On 35); Palau: Koror I., limestone ridge S. of inlet (under dead bark, Sm 48)
Taxonomic notes: Originally named for Truk (now “Chuuk”) (Smith 1953a) before the Palauan specimens had been identified, this species’ distribution suggests it might also be found on Yap; in addition, R. W. Taylor believes it may be a subspecies of a widespread New Guinean species (pers. comm.).

Vollenhovia
This genus is identified quite early in the key by the presence of a medial flange on the ventral petiole (a “keel”), but in case that character is missed, it also lacks propodeal spines, has a flat dorsal mesosomal profile, and has shallow antennal scrobes (the latter distinguishing it from Metapone). The widespread species V. oblonga is found throughout the area, but there appear to be some endemic species on Pohnpei and one on Chuuk. The small ones (kaselela, sp. 6041940, and pwidikidika) resemble some Melanesian species, but their size and sculpturing are distinct, the latter being extremely small, and the other two having particular combinations of smooth and sculptured surface. The large new species on Pohnpei, V. mwereka, has been collected only once—over 50 years ago—but is quite easily recognized by its wrinkly appearance. The remaining new species on Pohnpei, V. sp. 23031948, resembles an orangish V. oblonga but is distinctly smaller.

Taxonomic notes: Measurements: TL 2, HL 0.62, HW 0.55, CI 89, SL 0.36, SI 69, PW 0.39, ML 0.28. Antennae 12-segmented, funicular segments lengthening rapidly, terminal segment more than half the length of remaining funiculus. Scapes not reaching lateral vertex by 1/3 their length. Color: Mostly brownish yellow or orange; area around mandibular insertions, clypeus, scapes, legs, mesonotum, posterior petiole, and anterior gaster yellow. Sculpturing: Head with fine striae among large punctures; striations starting immediately above median clypeus, puntures continuing to underside of head; area behind eyes smooth. Pronotum to anterio-dorsal propodeum with very fine, wandering striations; smoother centrally and smooth around propodeal declivity. Lateral pronotum with punctures but glossy. Dorsal petiole smooth, sides rough; postpetiole and gaster mostly glossy. Similar species: In striations and proportions, Vollenhovia sp. 23031948 closely resembles V. oblonga Smith, F. 1860, which is also found in Micronesia. However, sp. 23031948 is smaller and slightly less punctured, and (as usual with a decrease in size among Vollenhovia) it has a smaller CI than oblonga.

TRIBE MYRMECININI
Myrmecina
In overall shape, pilosity and appearance of propodeal spines, this genus could easily be confused with Rogeria or Tetramorium, but its large groove along the lateral posterior of the head should eliminate any confusion.

Myrmecina sp. 7121952
Figs. 5C–D, 17
Specimen examined: Palau: Babelthuap I., E. Ngatpang (65 m, Gr 7-XII-52)
Taxonomic notes: Measurements: TL 2.02, HL 0.64, HW 0.62, CI 97, SL 0.48, SI 78, PW 0.42, ML 0.35. Antennae 12-segmented, with prominent three-segmented club longer than the remaining funiculus, last segment larger than the previous two combined. Scapes curvaceous, thin and bent to the shape of the sides of the head proximally, extending to the vertex. Mesosoma gently curved to posterior dorsal propodeum, where armed with two sharp spines, each as long as postpetiole. Color: Head, mesosoma, petiole, and postpetiole dark orange brown; antennae, area around mandibular insertions below eyes, legs, lateral gaster, and posterio-ventral gaster brownish orange; coxae and remaining gaster with transitional coloration. Pilosity: Entire body with long, silver hairs, from apical margin of mandibles to antennal club, tarsi, and posterior gaster, covering almost all parts between; long, silver hairs missing or few on posterior propodeum, lateral coxae and mesosoma, and area between lateral head and cephalic groove. Sculpturing: Head to postpetiole with deep, rounded striae becoming more linear on front of head and dorsal mesosoma; posterior propodeum smooth but outlined with distinct ridge the extends down propodeal spines and continues between them; dorsal propodeum smooth to edge of mesonotum. Similar species: Myrmecina sp. 7121952 is smaller and lighter than other Myrmecina species I examined, except for M. semipolita Forel 1905, which is lighter than sp. 7121952. M. semipolita also differs in sculpturing, having smoother sculpturing on the head and deeper sculpturing on the mesosoma. The only other species examined that appears similar to sp. 7121952 in overall shape and sculpturing type is modesta Mann 1919, but it is larger, darker, and has much deeper sculpturing all over.

Pristomyrmex
Large and glossy, this genus is quite distinct, even in the field, where it can often be found moving rather slowly in small foraging lines. Under the microscope, the clypeus is unique, although difficult to describe in a key—in profile it extends sharply out over the mandibles, unlike any other genus in the area (Figs. 10A–C). Within the genus, identification requires a careful examination of the pronotal and propodeal spines, but spine lengths are conveniently distinct among the species of Micronesia.

TRIBE PHEIDOLINI
Aphaenogaster
One of the more gangly Myrmicinae, this genus is distinct in having a foursegmented antennal club, and the club being similar in width as the remainder of the funiculus. Only one species is found in Micronesia, a predominantly Japanese species in the Bonin Islands; however, the genus does have representatives in the tropics and could turn up on other Micronesian islands.

Pheidole
Pheidole is a large and speciose genus, and identifying them can be difficult. In keys Pheidole often appears in several places, as their individual characters can ally them with other genera. Moreover, one of their most distinct features— dimorphism—is of no use if only a minor worker has been collected (majors being so large-headed they should be recognizable as such). Nonetheless, having

240

Micronesica 39(2), 2007

sharp propodeal spines and a three-segmented antennal club should immediately suggest Pheidole, and this can be kept in mind while eliminating other possibilities in the key. Solenopsis has a two-segmented club, and Monomorium lacks propodeal spines.
Specimens reported in Swezey (1939) as “Pheidole, species near philemon” have been made the type series of Pheidole recondita, and those he identified as “Pheidole species … A light brown species” have been determined as P. nindi. I suspect, too, that Weber’s (1950) specimens identified as “Pheidole, near rinae tipuna” from Saipan are also nindi. Weber describes this species as being much smaller than javana (now fervens), oceanica, and “bolabolensis” (surely boraborensis, now synonymized with oceanica) and close to rinae subsp. tipuna, but with a shorter head. This would be a close description of a nindi major, which lacks the elongate vertex of rinae and is similar in color and sculpturing; the only problem is that the minors of rinae are smooth on the head and promesothorax, whereas nindi minors are heavily sculptured there. Weber does not mention differences between the two casts, but he does write that this species is “less glabrous” than fervens, which strengthens the case that it is nindi.

TRIBE PHEIDOLOGETONINI
Carebara
The only species in this genus in Micronesia is also one of the smallest ants known, which alone helps greatly in its identification in the fiield. However, its small size makes a final determination in the lab difficult without adequate magnification. Its two-segmented antennal club and lack of propodeal spines distinguishes it from the small Pheidole nindi and P. recondita (which have three-segmented clubs and propodeal spines), but Solenopsis papuana also has a two-segmented club, lacks propodeal spines, and is very small. However, the club of Carebara is huge, outsizing the remainder of the funiculus. Carebara atoma is also dimorphic, and a major worker can easily be identified by the small “horns” at its vertex.

TRIBE SOLENOPSIDINI
Monomorium
The genus Monomorium is most easily recognized by its combination of a three-segmented antennal club and lack of anything more than corners on the propodeum. The clypeus is also distinct, having two longitudinal carinae, but this is difficult to recognize in some species. In Micronesia this genus has at least six species, most of which are quite easily distinguished. However, determinations I made of M. monomorium (Bolton’s 1987 replacement name for M. minutum) were done following Wilson and Taylor’s (1967) combining of javanum and liliuokalanii under minutum. Bolton (1987), though, considered these species distinct from minutum and probably best combined under chinense Santschi 1925. Thus I leave them as “chinense-group” at this time. I also follow Heterick’s (2001) synonymization of talpa Emery 1911 with australicum Forel 1907.

Solenopsis
Their ten-segmented antennae ending in a distinct two-segmented club make this genus easy to identify. Still, their overall body shape and lack of propodeal spines has led to confusion with Monomorium. Specimens reported in Swezey (1939) as a black species of Solenopsis from Yigo, Guam, were found in ANIC and reidentified as Monomorium chinense-group. The little S. papuana could also be confused with Carebara atoma, which also has a two-segmented club and a lack of propodeal spines, but the latter’s antennal club is larger than the remainder of the funiculus, which is quite different from that of Solenopsis.
Specimens of Solenopsis geminata were examined carefully for any individuals that might be S. invicta, as they are extremely close in appearance. Solenopsis invicta (the “red imported fire ant”) can be distinguished from geminata by a small “tooth” out of which the central clypeal hair emerges; in geminata, the surface of the clypeus around base of the clypeal hair is not raised. Their behavior, however, is quite different: invicta is aggressive and noxious, while geminata is not.

TRIBE STENAMMINI
Calyptomyrmex
Fig. 16
This genus can be immediately recognized by its large size, extensive covering in paddle-like hairs, and unreduced antennal segmentation. Eurhopalothrix and the Dacetini have fewer such hairs and fewer antennal segments, and the Dacetini are very small. I am unable to determine the Calyptomyrmex specimens from Micronesia to species. Two of the three specimens I examined were identified as beccarii and emeryi, and the third was an undetermined alate. Having only about two dozen species in total, it seems unlikely the genus has two in Palau, and I could find no difference between beccarii and emeryi specimens in MCZ. Their descriptions offer little direction, but I did not examine types and am not synonymizing them here. The alate from Chuuk could easily be a reproductive of the species on Palau, but I have even less direction for alates and leave it as “undetermined” here.

Specimens examined: FSM Chuuk: Tol Oleg—Foup (dealate female, Ya&Yo 40)

Rogeria
This genus is best identified through a process of elimination, as it has an overall appearance that strongly resembles Myrmecina and certain Tetramorium. But it lacks the carinae on the head of Mymecina and the modified lateral clypeus of Tetramorium. It also lacks a distinct antennal club, distinguishing it from Pheidole and Solenopsis, although it does have propodeal spines (its large size alone distinguishing it from Micronesian Monomorium).

This highly elusive genus is, strangely, found in the New World Tropics and the Indo-Pacific. I used the revision by Kugler (1994) to attempt an identification of the species found on Pohnpei (and later destroyed in the SEM), what I call here R. sp. 25111995.

Taxonomic notes: This specimen was lost in the process of making scanning electron micrographs. However, I feel that it is a unique species not yet described. Rogeria sp. 25111995 is darker, smaller, more evenly punctured, and hairier than most other species in the genus. Besides these overall features, sp. 25111995 is distinguished by a smooth and shining area between and anterior to the propodeal spines. Measurements estimated from photographs are as follows: HW 0.58, HL 0.6, SL 0.35, PL 0.4, PH 0.43, PPL 0.25, PPH 0.35, last three funicular segment lengths (going toward the last segment) = 0.05, 0.09, 0.2.

TRIBE TETRAMORIINI
Tetramorium
A large genus in Micronesia—both in species and individuals— Tetramorium specimens are difficult to identify to genus without a clear understanding of the flange that surrounds the antennal insertions. Often described as a shelf formed by the fused frontal lobes and clypeus, the character is a common point of confusion for beginners, and I have provided illustrations of it here. As an aid to identifying Tetramorium, it should be noted that they lack a distinct antennal club, have propodeal spines, and are monomorphic.

Clouse: Ants of Mircronesia

253

Species are not as difficult to identify as the key implies. The antennal segments, shape of the petiolar node, relative sizes of propodeal spines, and (at least in Micronesia) color are the most useful features, and misidentifications are usually easy to recognize. In addition, I used the pronotal hairs, especially as they appear from the front. Tetramorium lanuginosum and T. simillimum can be quickly identified from their pilosity, which is, respectively, very thick and very sparce. The other four species with 12-segmented antennae usually have a row of six long hairs along their anterior pronotum which descend in neatness from bicarinatum (Fig. 12E), to insolens, which has a small pair of crossing hairs in front of the row (Fig. 12F), to tonganum, which tends to have several distinct, recurved hairs in front of the row of six, to pacificum, where the long hairs are usually more scattered and variable in number.
Tetramorium insolens is an odd species that deserves some special discussion. Common in the Philippines, Melanesia, and Polynesia, it is strangely absent from all of Micronesia, except for its westernmost tip (Palau). The Palauan specimens were found mixed with T. bicarinatum ones (an unsurprising occurrence, considering the two species were synonymized by Wilson and Taylor in 1967, when many of the Micronesian specimens were first determined (Ward and Wetterer 2006)), and thus a hypothesis for their apparent absence in Micronesia immediately suggests itself, which is that they were missed by me while collecting and examining bicarinatum. However, insolens looks quite out of place among bicarinatum specimens, as its size and shape are much closer to pacificum, and it lacks the fine split of the ridge down the middle of the frons (an easily checked feature on bicarinatum identifications). Specimens of insolens are also unlikely to be mixed with pacificum collections, though, since the two differ noticeably in color. Thus, it seems that insolens is truly absent from much of Micronesia. It should be added that the Palauan specimens of insolens were believed by me to be a distinct species, but this was due to my lack of experience with the variation of insolens, which is considerable when one looks at color, size, and pilosity. These features can be misleading among bicarinatum, insolens, and pacificum, and my key relies on the sculpturing characters of Bolton (1979).
Tetramorium bicarinatum (Nylander 1846) Myrmica bicarinata Nylander 1846; called Tetramorium guineense in Wilson and Taylor (1967) and other texts due to an early misidentification (Bolton 1995).

Figs. 12B, 20
Specimen examined: Palau: Koror (N.E.), limestone ridge (40 m, Gr 14-XII52)
Taxonomic notes: Measurements: TL 3.5, HL 0.97, HW 0.92, CI 95, SL 0.92, SI 100, PW 0.68, ML 0.5. Antennae 11-segmented with threesegmented club about half as long as remaining funiculus; scape extending beyond vertex by a quarter of its length; eyes at mid-level of head, slightly in front of lateral, and bulging, creating the widest section of the head. Dorsal mesosoma in profile sloping down slightly to dorsal propodeum, then with vertical declivity; dorsal profile uneven due to deep, wide rugae. Dorsal propodeal spine as long as 80% the distance between its tip and the tip of the ventral propodeal spine; ventral spine about half the length of dorsal but almost completely hidden by bulla in side view. Petiole with stalk-like, slightly downwardly curving peduncle longer than length of remaining petiole by about 1/6 the peduncle length; node rising abruptly, its anterior and posterior faces parallel and perpendicular to ventral; node as long as maximum height, dorsal surface bulging slightly, overall square in profile, slightly wider posteriorly in dorsal view; petiolar spiracle indistinct and located on lateral node near peduncle. Postpetiole similar in height to petiole but contrasting in shape, rounded dorsally and broadly attached to gaster; postpetiolar sternite swollen, especially anteriorly. First gastral tergite covering 90% of gaster in dorsal view, second tergite filling remainder of view. Color: Body, except for dorsal propodeal spines, concolorous dark reddish brown with black sculpturing. Mandibles, antennae, legs, and dorsal propodeal spines light orange. Pilosity: Head, mesosoma, and gaster with sparse, long, standing silver hairs, especially long on vertex, shorter on gaster, often further from each other than their own length, missing from central gastral tergite and posterior propodeum. Legs, mandibles, and especially antennae with denser covering of similar hairs, although more reclined. Sculpturing: Head with widely spaced,

sharp, sweeping, linear ridges; mesosoma with deep, disorganized rugae; mandibles, petiole, postpetiole and gaster smooth. Linear sculpturing on head as far apart as maximal width of scape at vertex, narrowing toward clypeus, becoming loosely reticulate between eyes and antennal insertions and around back of the head, circling around eyes and remaining fairly unbroken by clypeal border. Mesosoma glossy with highly disorganized rugae, more or less longitudinal on dorsal pronotum and transverse on epinotum. Sculpturing less distinct on mesepisternum and metepisternum, becoming irregular bumps. Hints of sculpturing on peduncle extending to lower petiolar node but remainder of body mostly smooth and almost glossy. Similar species: Tetramorium sp. 14121952 most closely resembles the T. turneri Forel 1910 in overall shape, color, sculpturing and size, but important differences are as follows: Unlike turneri, sp. 14121952 has an almost completely unsculptured, nearly glossy, petiolar node and more linear than reticulate sculpturing on the head.

SUBFAMILY AMBLYOPONINAE
TRIBE AMBLYOPONINI
Prionopelta
Prionopelta are the only members of the Amblyoponinae in Micronesia, and they are readily identified by the mere constriction separating their petiole and gaster. Otherwise, they appear quite ponerine, which was their original subfamily placement before Bolton (2003) raised their tribe to subfamily, a move supported by the molecular phylogeny of Moreau et al. (2006).
Wilson and Taylor (1967) commented that opaca and kraepelini are morphologically very similar to each other in Micronesia, and they echo doubts that the two are truly separate species. I did not change determinations, despite some dubious specimens, as I did agree that kraepelini appeared shinier. If kraepelini is a separate species, then it would be odd in being both (1) widespread but restricted to Micronesia and (barely) Polynesia (perhaps by human introduction (Wilson and Taylor 1967)), and (2) overlapping with its sister species, opaca, on the same remote islands.

SUBFAMILY PONERINAE
TRIBE PLATYTHYREINI
Platythyrea
Platythyrea are best distinguished by the small tooth on the pretarsal claws, but absent a good microscope, they are also recognizable by their lack of erect hairs and long, rectangular body shape. Wilson and Taylor (1967) noted that Platythyrea parallela is widespread but not abundant in Polynesia, and indeed my only collection of it in Micronesia was when a specimen fell on me in a restaurant.

TRIBE PONERINI
Anochetus
With long, thin, trap-like mandibles, these ponerines resemble Odontomachus and Strumigenys (although the latter should not be confused with Anochetus, as they have two segments between the mesosoma and gaster and are much smaller). There is only one species of Odontomachus in Micronesia, and it is larger and darker than either of the two Anochetus, but to be sure, one should notice the petiolar node, which is not pointed in Anochetus. An additional character is the ridge along the back of the head, which forms a V-shape in Odontomachus but a continuous curve in Anochetus.

Hypoponera
Hypoponera are easily confused with Ponera and Pachycondyla; the characters separating them are distinct but small, and the overall body shape and appearance of all three genera are very similar. Hypoponera are distinguished most readily by the absence of both Ponera’s small translucent area on the ventral petiolar process and Pachycondyla’s small simple spur in front of the large pectinate spur on the hind tibiae. In Micronesia, Ponera are also smaller and more variable than Hypoponera, and Pachycondyla species are usually larger and have larger eyes.
For determining species, few genera can be as confounding as Hypoponera. For Micronesian specimens, this is aggravated by the fact that I found no discussions or keys which simultaneously treat confinis, opaciceps, and pruinosa. So the tapering petiolar node and clearly defined mesepisternum—good for separating confinis from opaciceps in Polynesia—are alone not enough when pruinosa (which shares these characters) is present. However, confinis has remarkably small eyes, and, after examining enough specimens, one can recognize the more severe tapering of pruinosa’s petiolar node.
Unfortunately, the eyes alone cannot be used to separate these three species, since the number of ommatidia for opaciceps overlap with those of the other two. A survey of already-determined ANIC specimens gave the following results: confinis (2–6, avg. = 3.8 ± SD 1.1, N = 25), opaciceps (5–12, avg. = 8.0 ± SD 1.9, N = 25), pruinosa (7–20, avg. = 12.1 ± SD 2.7, N = 20). Interestingly, the two pruinosa specimens with fewer than 10 ommatidia (7 and 8) also had sculpturing between and katepisternum and anepisternum, a character more commonly seen in opaciceps, so it may be that these were simply opaciceps specimens with ambiguous petiolar nodes. In any case, these three species and even the fairly easily recognized punctatissima are suspected of hiding taxonomic surprises behind their small collection of rather variable characters.

Leptogenys
Leptogenys are easily recognized by their toothless, sickle-shaped mandibles that close with a space between them and the clypeus. Within the genus, there appears to be only one species in Micronesia, but its identity is unclear. Although Wilson and Taylor (1967) discussed the possibility that L. falcigera is a junior synonym of maxillosa (Smith, F. 1858), I have left previous determinations of falcigera as such, and I tentatively assume that those specimens (mostly males) identified only to genus by Smith are the same. I did not see the morphological differences between falcigera and maxillosa reported by Wilson and Taylor from W. L. Brown’s notes, but I relied on previously identified collections, which could be wrong.

Pachycondyla
Although identifying Pachycondyla at the genus level can be difficult (see the first paragraph under Hypoponera above), the three species found in Micronesia are fairly easy to distinguish. I key them above such that luteipes is segregated first due to its striations on the lateral pronotum, but luteipes and atrata are generally more similar to each other than to stigma in having a significant drop in the mesosomal profile before the propodeum. Stigma is also different in its distribution: it is a New World tramp that has spread worldwide; luteipes and atrata are from the Malay Archipelago and appear not to extend east of Chuuk.
The streamlined morphology of Pachycondyla lends itself to ambiguities, and a clearer understanding of what I call here luteipes requires additional comparisons to types. Wilson (1958b) raised croceicornis, the Melanesian variety luteipes, to species status based on an examination of specimens from New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, but he did this provisionally pending a more detailed examination of specimens from Indo-Malaysia (Pachycondyla luteipes types are from the Nicobar Islands—the extreme North West of the Indonesian archipelago.). The distributional boundaries of the two species are not known, and Indonesia and Melanesia are equally apt to have species which extend into Micronesia. An additional complication has been related to me by S. Shattuck: B. Brown’s unpublished key used obscurans (Walker 1859) instead of luteipes, saying they are synonymous. At the moment I report Micronesian specimens as they were originally determined at ANIC.

Ponera
Recognizing the genus Ponera is difficult (see the first paragraph under Hypoponera above), and in most areas the species are equally challenging. Although my key relies on certain measurements and indices, the Ponera fauna of Micronesia is mercifully small and readily identified with well-mounted material and a good microscope.
