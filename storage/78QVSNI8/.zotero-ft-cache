Creating an SQLite Database for the Guam Forest Inventory Survey

This iPython notebook creates an SQLite database containing US Forest Service Forest Inventory data collected on Guam in 2003 and 2013.

The Forest Service has kindly provided online access to data from its national forest inventory surveys on its FIA DataMart page. Data are available as Microsoft Access databases (*.accx) for Windows users and as plain text tables (*.csv) for Mac and Linux users.

Survey methods and resulting data are very thoroughly documented in PDFs stored in the Access database zip file. For Guam, this is http://apps.fs.fed.us/fiadb-downloads/Databases/GUaccdb.zip .
