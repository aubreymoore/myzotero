Safety Equipment
Repair fume hood: counterbalance for heavy glass door is broken Replace missing ﬁre extinguisher Repair safety shower: chain from foot pedal to lever on shower head is missing Move chemical cabinets for corrosives and ﬂammables to the ante room at the back left of ALS124. Install and provision a ﬁrst aid kit.
Layout
Arrange lab tables as per attached ﬂoor plan and ajjust so they are all level and at the same height. This arrangement will provide 32 work stations while providing a wide access path down the center of the room. (The current layout is not navigable by students in wheel chairs.) Provide each workstation with a 110v electrical outlet. Power cables to run through conduits attached underneath lab table tops. (Eliminates extension cords which are a trip hazard.)
Audiovisual
Remove the ceiling mount for a projector, associated wires, and the built-in projector screen. Remove the built-in blackboard. Mount the existing large screen monitor, or a larger one on the wall where the blackboard is currently located.
Miscellaneous
Replace broken ceiling tiles. Replace door to microscope room. Equip with digital lock. Install door knob on door to ante room on northern side of lab. Paint ﬂoor.
