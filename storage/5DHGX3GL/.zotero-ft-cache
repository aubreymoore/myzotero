V(D). Planned Program (Activity)
1. Brief description of the Activity
Little fire ant (LFA) was detected on Guam in 2011 and continues to spread in Guam. A delimiting survey was completed in a GovGuam Conservation Forest that includes planted acacia trees interspersed with shrubs and bushes. The areas was treated with Tango, a pesticide that contains the insect growth regulator s-methoprene, and Siesta, a granular formulation of a chitinase inhibitor, metaflumizone. Following the application of the pesticides, the worker ants ingest a sublethal dose of the active ingredient of either pesticide, feed it to the queen upon returning to the main colony. Once the queen dies, the workers and ultimately the entire colony gradually dies out. Initial results indicated that LFA's numbers decreased by about 60%. Work on coconut rhinoceros beetle has focused in detecting biological control organisms than can be effective in Guam. Whereas control with virus imported from New Zeland failed, two viruses recently brought from Papua New Guinea have been deemed promising for bio control. CNAS faculty provide service and training on species invasive identification, serve in the Invasive Species Council and other committees, and participate in the National Plant Diagnostic Network. Plant inventories of urban landscapes have continued. Data are entered into the Plan-it Geo Treeplotter database. Propagated and out-planted Guam rare plant species are establish in protected sites. Plants are monitored and maintained using adaptive management until they are established. Monitoring included documenting pest problems. Agriculture and forest lands are affected by climate change, but also contribute to it through greenhouse gas emissions. Soil organic C, in turn, could be increased by feedback loops caused by climate change. Results from studies consisting in applications of biochar and compost in limestone soils in Northern Guam suggested positive effects on corn yields and trends to lower CO2 emissions. Here is an outline of the major research thrusts over the next 5 years. - implementation of biological control to mitigate damage from invasive species -improvement of integrated pest management of agricultural and natural resource systems - monitoring of invasive pests and their impact on insular environment - conduct urban forest inventory on Guam - characterization of genetics of threatened and endangered plants on Guam and the region - investigate how to enhance carbon content of Guam soils -maintenance and improvement of biological collections and biodiversity information systems

3c. Qualitative Outcome or Impact Statement

Issue (Who cares and Why) Invasive species have large detrimental effects on Guam's environment and people. These species continue to arrive to Guam because of increasing commercial, military and public activities. The cycad scale, the coconut rhinocero beetle and the little fire ant are the most common invasive species but other species are detected periodically by our extension and research personnel.
What has been done Numerous workshops and meetings have been conducted to increase awareness of the invasive species problem and explain strategies to reduce their spread and impact. Extension and research faculty participate in the Guam Invasive Species Council and collaborate with APHIS to identify new insects and pathogens and assess the chances of invasion. They also work regionally to prevent invasions in Micronesia, Polynesia and the Western United States.
Results Approaches to conduct surveillance of the coconut rhinocero beetle and the little fir ant have been delivered throughout Micronesia. Information and assistance have also been provided for monitoring and rapid responses to invasions.

Issue (Who cares and Why) Strategic plans and policies about invasive species, environmental degradation, and ecological restoration need to be develop further in Guam through the collaborative effort of federal agencies, Guam government, University of Guam, and local communities.

Results Guam Invasive Species Master Plan and CNMI Invasive Species Master Plan both completed, published, and submitted to the respective legislatures in 2017.
In addition, there is continued growing awareness on the part of policy makers and general public.

Many plans have been developed by local and federal government agencies, but implementation remains problematic due to funding limitations and lack of professional capacity.

What has been done
In regard to invasive species, CNAS research and extension personnel have continued working on different initiatives to reduce their the impact, improve detection and preventing them for infecting other islands. The Guam Invasive Species Master Plan will be revised to incorporate more actionable items.

-CNAS research and extension personnel participates in the Cooperative Agriculture Pest Survey (CAPS) program aimed to conducting national and state surveys targeted to plant pests, diseases, and weeds identified as threats to agriculture and the environment.
-The Arborist Certification program for Guam is run at CNAS.
-Endangered native orchids were re-established at the Anderson Air Force base with 87% success rate in partnerships with the U.S. Department of Defense
Results -Relocation and protection of endangered native snail species in Guam has been successful through collaborative efforts involving efforts by CNAS and several agencies.
-Partnerships with the U.S. Military has led to relocation of endangered native orchid species caused by land use changes and to the establishment of seedlings of a native trees species with only one remaining adult individual left.
- Advise was provided to federal agencies on issues regarding federally listed plant species. APHIS has acknowledged the relevant role of CNAS in generating knowledge and spreading information about invasive species.

V(I). Planned Program (Evaluation Studies)
Evaluation Results
Federal agencies periodically conduct evaluation of extension and research projects and positive reviews have been received. Feedback from stakeholders is requested following workshops, focus groups and other activities. The M.S. program in Sustainable Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources created in 2017 at the College of Natural and Applied Sciences have progressed through the teaching efforts of extension and research faculty, and has increased enrollment with students scheduled to graduate in 2019. Initial evaluations from the UOG Graduate Council have been positive. Research faculty are evaluated yearly by the WPTRC director to allocate HATCH funds based on a standard matrix to assess research productivity and impact.
Key Items of Evaluation
Overall satisfaction with content and delivery of workshops, focus groups, and other activities was high (> 85% positive responses), Participants expressed strong interest in participating in conservation initiatives.
