Seven Trees, Seven Practices
Starting you forest garden with seven fast to fruit trees
Mark Acosta, Bob Barber, & Frank Cruz

Fast to fruit trees
• Fruit trees bearing fruit in 3-4 years. • For many new farmers establishing
agroforestry or fruit tree plantings • Provides a quick economic return and
local market impact than fruit trees taking 5-7 years or longer to fruit. • In recent years chefs on Guam have expressed the desire for more variety in local fruits. • Offers the potential of commercial quantities of fruit in only a few years.

Land Preparation
If planting on new or overgrown land, clear unwanted vegetation but do not remove topsoil
If using heavy equipment, do not scrape the soil Steeply sloping land should not be stripped of plant cover
due to susceptibility to erosion Consider using sheet mulching
Do not operate any machinery on wet soil; this can compact the soil and negatively impact plant growth and development and also increases soil erosion

Planting Preparation
• Break up and prune any of the roots that are circling the root ball - “pot bound roots”
• Inspect roots for “j” root; make sure tap root is straight
• “Its better to plant a $1 plant in a $10 hole than it is to plant $10 plant in a $1 hole”

Planting and Care
• Minimum:
• Dig a hole at least the same depth and twice as wide as the root ball
• The crown (point where root & stem meet) should be level with the ground surface
• Except with citrus where the crown should be above ground level

Mulch and Sheet Mulch
• Mulch or Sheet Mulch Your Plants
• Acts as a weed barrier • Provides slow release of nutrients • Conserves water • Protects your plants from bushcutters
• Bushcutters
• Often damage desired plants • “Bushcutter disease” - careless cuts can girdle tree;
kills many trees on Guam • Throw up clippings and soil/rocks which can damage
trees and spread disease Keep soil and mulch away (several inches) from the base of the stem to avoid rot.

Common Causes of Plant Death
• Bushcutter damage • Planted too deep • Mulched too deep • Over-watered or under-watered • Improper shoot-to-root ratio in
transplanting

How to Propagate: Seed, Air Layering, Grafting Seed, Air Layering, Grafting Seed, Air Layering Seed, Cutting, Air Layering, Grafting Cuttings, Air Layering Root shoot & root Cuttings, Air Layering Cuttings, Air Layering

Calamansi
• Citrofortunella microcarpa • Also known as Calamondin • Drought tolerant • Cannot tolerate waterlogged soils • Can tolerate a wide range of soil types • Keep crown clear of soil • Can be used as a living fence

Calamansi
• Prune water suckers/sprouts • Prune to an open center to improve
airflow through canopy and increase light to branches • Flowers and fruits most of the year if irrigated • Peel can be used in animal feed mixes • Juice can be used as a lemon or lime alternative • Used in keleguen, finadene, jams, jellies, marmalades, teas, juices, and soups

Calamansi

Key lime
• Citrus aurantifolia • Also known as Mexican key lime • Cannot tolerate waterlogged soils • Keep crown clear of soil • Can be used as living fence • Prune to an open center to improve
airflow through canopy and increase light to branches

Key lime
• Harvest when the color has changed from dark to light green, the surface is smooth and the fruit feels slightly soft to the touch
• Commonly the fully ripe, yellow limes are gathered from the ground
• Fruit is fragrant and acidic • Used in kelaguen, finadene, jams, jellies,
marmalades, and juices • Caution: Key lime has sharp spines or
thorns

Key lime

Soursop
• Annona muricata • Also known as guayabano (Tagalog) and
laguana (Chamorro) • Tolerates a wide variety of soil types • If soil is too dry, the tree will drop all its
leaves; mulching and irrigation are recommended • Plant can be easily shaped by pruning • Flowers and fruits more or less throughout the year

Soursop
• Harvest fruit when full grown and still firm but slightly yellow-green
• If allowed to soften on the tree for too long, it will fall and break open
• Juice and pulp can be used in drinks or fruit can be dried
• Fruit and pulp may be used as animal fodder if seeds are removed
• Caution: Seeds are poisonous and the oil can cause eye inflammation

Mulberry
• Morus nigra • Commonly known an black mulberry • Tolerates most soil types • Drought and flood tolerant • Agroforestry uses include shade, shelter,
animal fodder, as a windbreak, and as a living fence • Year-round fruit production with irrigation

Mulberry
• Fruit is ripe when the color darkens to a deep red or purplish black
• Short shelf life • Used in jams, jellies, marmalades, juices,
sauces, and desserts • Can be dried into a powder

Breadfruit
• Artocarpus altilis • Lemmai (Chamorro) • Trees are salt and drought tolerant • Adapted to most soil types • Trees can be “kept low” by regular
pruning • Does well inter-planted with other species • Fruits can weigh 0.5 – 3 lbs

Breadfruit
• Indicators of fruit maturity: sap dripping from fruit, bumps on surface become smooth, and color change from green to yellow
• Caution: Roots can damage structures if planted too close and can be easily damaged by mowers and other equipment (heavy mulching recommended)

Breadfruit

Pomegranate
• Punica granatum L. • Overall a tough, dense, low growing plant
ideal for barrier plantings and windbreaks • Tolerates a wide range of soil types • Drought tolerant • Irrigation needed for fruit production
during extended dry periods • Fruits forms only on tips of new growth

Pomegranate
• Fruits are harvested once they turn color • Fruits should be cut from tree – not pulled
off. • Over mature fruits will crack • Fruits do not continue to ripen after
harvest • Flesh around seeds is eaten fresh • Processed for juice or syrup • Caution: Pomegranate has many spines
or thorns

Pomegranate

Fig
• Ficus carica • Over 1,000 cultivars of fig • Brown Turkey and White Kadota on Guam • Grows well in moist, but not saturated
soils • Requires frequent watering during dry
season • Advisable to prune trees to facilitate
harvesting

Fig
• Can tolerate severe pruning • Can be pruned as an espalier or kept
very low to the ground • Harvested fruits are fragile and should be
placed in a container so they do not damage each other • High in fiber • Caution: Contains latex which may cause skin rash
