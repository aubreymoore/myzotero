SUMMARY
Twelve geographical isolates of Oryctes baculovirus were cloned in DSIR-HA-1179 cells. The DNA of these isolates was analysed by restriction endonuclease digestion with the enzymes BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII and PstI. Each isolate showed slightly different restriction fragment electrophoresis profiles. Most of the changes were due to small insertions or deletions of DNA, although two isolates lacked a single restriction site. The sites of genotypic change were not randomly distributed but were mainly associated with regions that have been shown to contain reiterated sequences.
The use of Oryctes baculovirus to control pest populations of the coconut palm rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros, is well documented (Bedford, 1981). Its main success has been in the South Pacific when the disease was introduced into several islands with very serious pest damage. The virus was first discovered in Malaysia (Huger, 1966) and is endemic in other neighbouring countries (Zelazny, 1977). This paper examines genotypic variation amongst Oryctes baculovirus isolates by the analysis of D N A restriction digests and mapping D N A insertions, deletions and restriction site changes. Twelve isolates of Oryctes baculovirus were examined. All except two of the isolates were collected from areas where the virus occurs naturally.
The history of the twelve isolates is given in Table 1. All virus isolates were twice cloned by endpoint dilution as previously described (Crawford & Sheehan, 1985). Isolates were replicated in DSIR-HA-1179 cells (Crawford, 1982) and the D N A was purified from pelleted, extracellular virus as previously described (Crawford et al., 1985). The D N A of each isolate was digested with each of four restriction enzymes, BamHI, EcoRI, HindlII and PstI. The cleaved DNA was run on 0.7% horizontal, submerged, agarose gels using 0-089 M-Tris, 0.089 M-boric acid, 0-002 MEDTA pH 8'0 as the electrophoresis running buffer. DNA fragments were stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/1) and examined with a u.v. transilluminator.
The results of these digestions are shown in Fig. 1; a summary of the differences observed is given in Fig. 2. All the strains could be distinguished from each other on the basis of their restriction fragment profiles. All strains were compared with our type strain, PV505, with which most of the molecular biological investigations have been carried out (Payne et al., 1977; Crawford & Sheehan, 1985) including a physical map of its D N A (Crawford et al., 1985).
The major differences between strains were the presence or absence of small pieces of DNA varying between 30 and 150 bases in size. In general, the greater the geographical separation of isolates the greater the genotypic variation. Differences in the BamHI, HindlII, EcoRI and PstI patterns of the five isolates from Southern Luzon (22A, 46P, AP371, V23B and PV505) were due to the presence or absence of a 100-base insert in the EcoRI fragment S and a 30-base insert in the PstI fragment G. Also, deletions of between 40 and 70 bases occurred within EcoRI fragment e. Of the three other Philippine isolates, DVO (Mindanao) showed similar changes but the two isolates from Bugsuk Island (X2B and B36) each had an additional insert of 70 and 90 bases

The location of regions containing reiterated sequences is shown by the shaded boxes above the PV505 genome. The approximate location of the D N A insertions and deletions is given by the black boxes on the other 11 genomes. Above the boxes, + represents an insertion and - a deletion, and the number following is an estimate of the number of bases involved. The figures below the boxes show the position of the box in kilobases from the left-hand end of EcoRl fragment A, the designated start of the Oryctes baculovirus physical map (Crawford et al., 1985).

respectively in B a m H I fragment H. It is noteworthy that virus from other parts of the Philippines has been released on Bugsuk Island.
Both the Tanzanian and Seychelles isolates originated from Samoa and passed through a less susceptible species, Oryctes monoeeros. The virus was released into the O. monoceros populations of the Seychelles in 1972 and in 1979 O. monoceros cultures were infected in Tanzania. In turn, the virus had been introduced into Samoa from Malaysia in 1964. This makes it hardly surprising that isolates S2A and SEY are different. The Malaysian (MSA) isolate had a unique HindIII restriction site loss in E c o R I fragment T and the Indian isolate had a unique 70-base insertion in HindIII fragment O.
Many of the genotypic changes occurred in the same regions of the genome in which reiterated sequences have been shown to occur (shaded boxes in Fig. 2; Crawford et al., 1985). Until we understand the significance of these reiterated sequences it is difficult to interpret this observation. Fraser et al. (1985) showed that at least some spontaneous baculovirus mutants were due to the insertion of a foreign DNA sequence which had the properties of a transposon of the host cell. Perhaps these regions contain small inverted repeats which increase the rates of D N A excision and insertion. Another simpler possibility is that insertions and deletions occur throughout the genome but these are the only regions where such changes are not lethal. The sequencing of one or more of these areas of reiterated sequence will be necessary to understand these processes further.

• Virus taken from infected O. monoceros. The Tanzanian isolate was from a laboratory colony and Seychelles isolate from a field population. All other isolates were from field populations of O. rhinoceros.

At the moment, we have no information on the naturally occurring rate of genotypic change in Oryctes baculovirus or any other baculoviruses. As part of a virus release programme on the islands of the Maldives, Indian Ocean, several of the Oryctes baculovirus clones described here have been released into isolated, previously unexposed O. rhinoceros populations. It will be interesting to re-isolate the virus from these populations and study the genotypic changes that occur in time.
The authors wish to thank Mr Chris Lomer, Institute of Virology, Oxford, U.K. for providing the virus isolate from the Seychelles and Mr K. S. Mohan, Central Plantation Crops Research Institute, Kayangulam, Kerala, India, for the Indian virus isolate.
