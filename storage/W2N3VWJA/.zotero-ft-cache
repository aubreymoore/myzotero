The Forest Inventory and Analysis Program collected, analyzed, and summarized ﬁeld data on 46 forested plots on the island of Guam. Estimates of forest area, tree stem volume and biomass, the numbers of trees, tree damages, and the distribution of tree sizes were summarized for this statistical sample. Detailed tables and graphical highlights provide a summary of Guam’s forest resources and a baseline from which to detect future change following remeasurement of the permanent ﬁeld plots.
Keywords: Guam, biomass, damage, FIA, forest inventory, volume.

Summary
The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program established a systematic sample of forest ﬁeld plots on Guam to estimate forest area, tree stem volume and biomass, tree damages, and associated understory vegetation. Thirty-two permanent ﬁeld plots were established in limestone forest and 14 in volcanic forest. Land cover was mapped from high-resolution satellite data and merged with the soil layer in a geographic information system to stratify the ﬁeld sample. The forest area on Guam occupies approximately 63,830 acres, with limestone forest accounting for about 70 percent of that total. About 18 percent of Guam was classiﬁed as urban land and includes roads, towns, airstrips, and military facilities. We estimated gross tree stem volume to be about 91 million cubic feet, inclusive of all tree size classes. Aboveground stem weight for all trees greater than or equal to 5 inches in diameter at breast height was estimated to be about 1 million tons. About 21 percent of the trees sampled exhibited some form of physical damage. Of those damaged trees, evidence of decay was found in nearly one-third of the individuals. Physical breakage owing to weather and damage by falling trees were cited as the primary damaging agents in approximately 64 percent of the damage cases. The average number of tree species per sixth-acre plot was about four in both limestone and volcanic forest types. Forty-eight tree species and about 140 understory species were measured on 46 sixth-acre plots.

Introduction
This summary of forest resources on the island of Guam (ﬁg. 1) was based on a forest inventory conducted in 2002 by the USDA Forest Service, Paciﬁc Northwest Forest Inventory and Analysis Program (FIA) in cooperation with Paciﬁc Island foresters. The key inventory objectives were to help answer local and national questions about the status and trends in tropical forested ecosystems and to share forestry skills among cultures and agencies. The ﬁeldwork for this inventory was conducted by a multinational crew including students and foresters from Guam, foresters from American Samoa, and mainland U.S. foresters and ecologists.
This systematic, sample-based ﬁeld inventory on Guam was the ﬁrst of its kind to be conducted across the island to establish estimates for the area of forest types, tree size distribution, volume, biomass, and damages for living and dead trees. It was designed to provide resource managers with information about the current situation so they can better manage their forested and nonforested lands and, after remeasurement, better manage or mitigate any changes in the resource. Empirically based knowledge of the status and trends in forest vegetation can help managers plan sustainable supplies of wood, control invasive species, control erosion, and manage disturbances such as ﬁre and animal damage.
Objectives
1. Estimate the area of forest land by forest type group and stand size class. 2. Estimate the volume, biomass, and carbon storage for tree species by
diameter class. 3. Estimate the numbers of trees affected by damaging agents, such as insects
and diseases, and estimate the number of dead trees. 4. Share measurement and analysis techniques among groups involved in the
inventory.
Methods Site Description
The island of Guam is the largest and farthest south in the north-south sweeping Marianas archipelago (ﬁg. 1). The highest point on Guam is Mount Lamlam with an elevation of 1,332 feet. Guam is an unincorporated territory of the United States with signiﬁcant income generated from tourism. The climate is tropical marine with little annual variation in temperature, but a pronounced dry season from January to June (ﬁg. 2).

Signiﬁcant disturbance agents have shaped the vegetation on Guam. Humans and tropical storms continue changing forest structure and composition.

A signiﬁcant portion of land on Guam is occupied by the U.S. military. On a portion of these lands, a system of refuges and wildlife reserves are overlain on the military lands. For example, Ritidian Point, approximately 22,500 acres at the northern tip of Guam, is administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as a national wildlife refuge.
Signiﬁcant disturbance agents have shaped vegetation in Guam, including frequent tropical storms and typhoons, human-caused grassland and forest ﬁres, animal rooting, browsing and trampling, mass soil movements and erosion, nonnative insects and pathogens, invasive weeds, historical military actions, and historical timber harvest.
The northern half of the island is generally ﬂat limestone plateau with abrupt dropoffs and cliffs toward the ocean. Locally the limestone can be strongly weathered into rugged karstic terrain. Soils are related to vegetation communities in Guam. The limestone soils in the north are covered with forest in areas not cultivated or urbanized. The southern part of the island features rolling to mountainous terrain in the deeply weathered volcanic soils. The volcanic soils on the southern half of Guam are covered primarily by grassland, with some ravine forest occurring in sheltered and leeward sites.
Vegetation Types
The vegetation of Guam was categorized (Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg 1998) according to the major underlying soil types: (1) northern limestone vegetation, and (2) southern volcanic vegetation. The limestone vegetation was further broken down into ﬁve classes by Fosberg (1960): Artocarpus-Ficus forest, Mammea forest, Cordia forest, Merrilliodendron-Ficus forest, and Pandanus forest. A brief description of each forest community follows. Pure examples of these forest types are now rare on Guam; instead these forests tend to be mixtures with secondary species predominating. The FIA inventory does not currently provide sufﬁcient plot density to reliably classify vegetation types in these highly diverse tropical forests but provides plot-level data to help reﬁne remotely sensed estimates of forest type acreage and developmental stage. Some of the forest types discussed below may not be represented in the plot-level information provided from this inventory owing to the systematic sampling design having missed the forest type. Ongoing mapping efforts will provide greater spatial detail and better reﬁnement of forest types.

Guam’s Forest Resources, 2002
Limestone forest types
Artocarpus-Ficus— A widespread forest type on limestone in Guam with canopy dominants including Artocarpus mariannensis (breadfruit) and Ficus prolixa (banyan). Mammea forest— Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg (1998) characterize this forest type as dominated by Mammea odorata and by its occurrence on the eastern escarpment of the northern limestone plateau. Cordia forest— This is an open scrub-forest type on steep slopes and cliffs dominated by Cordia subcordata Lam. Merrilliodendron-Ficus forest— Merrilliodendron megacarpum (Hemsley) Sleumer and Ficus prolixa dominate this tall forest type. Pandanus forest— This moderate-height forest is dominated by Pandanus tectorius. Other common genera include Flagellaria, Cestrum, Triphasia, and Nephrolepis (Fosberg 1960).
Volcanic Types
The southern, volcanic half of the island is vegetated with a mix of grassland and patchy forest. The forest tends to follow topographic features, such as river drainages, sheltered depressions, and ravines. Grassland savannas are dominated by the dense, sharp-leaved Miscanthus ﬂoridulus (Labill.) Warb. ex K. Schum. & Laut. (swordgrass), and smaller areas of Pennisetum polystachyon (L.) J.A. Schultes (mission grass) and Dimeria chloridiformis (Gand.) K. Schum. & Laut. Common ravine forest trees include Areca catechu, (see table 1 for common names of trees) Ficus prolixa, Glochidion mariana Mueller-Arg., L., Hibiscus tiliaceus, Pandanus tectorius, P. dubius Sprengel, and Premna serratifolia L. (Fosberg 1960).
Low-lying, halophytic (sea-salt adapted) vegetation is found along beaches in the north and south, and may be composed solely of Casuarina equisetifolia or a mixture of species including Casuarina, Cocos nucifera, Guettarda speciosa, Hernandia sonora, Pandanus tectorius, Scaevola taccada (Gaertn.) Roxb., Thespesia populnea (L.) Soland. ex Correa, and Tournefortia argentea L. f. (Fosberg 1960). Areas of swamp, mangrove, and marsh are also found on Guam.

Regions of barren, eroding soil are prevalent in the southern part of the island. The erosion problem is being addressed individually by multiple agencies and coordinated jointly through a multiagency consortium working on the vegetation strategy for southern Guam (Bell et al. 2002).
Field Methods
This inventory was based on the national FIA inventory design that was implemented across the mainland United States. Adaptations were made to the national design to use topography to deﬁne site productivity and to include additional branching and rooting forms, additional tree crown measurements, and specialinterest species ranging from invasive plants to pathogens to culturally or economically important species of various life forms. In the mainland FIA Program, plots are spaced within forest land on a 3.3-mile grid. With the assistance of the Government of Guam, Division of Forestry, plots were spaced across all vegetation types at 1.9-mile intervals, yielding a triple intensiﬁcation of the mainland inventory plot grid.
The FIA plot-cluster is composed of four 24-foot-radius subplots (ﬁg. 3). Three of those subplots are equally spaced, as if on spokes of a wheel, around the central subplot. The distance from the middle of the central subplot to the middle of each subplot on the three spokes was 120 feet.
A variety of information was collected at the plot, subplot, and tree levels (USDA Forest Service 2002). Differences in forest-type conditions are also mapped. For example, roads that intersect subplots are mapped, as are clear boundaries in forest tree size classes. The primary variables collected include plot location, slope, aspect, elevation, subplot slope position and shape, tree species, diameters, heights, damages, branching and rooting forms, decay, epiphytic loadings, crown characteristics, tree locations, and regeneration information. The ﬁeldwork for this inventory was performed February to April 2002, before the two major typhoons, Chata’an and Pongsona, struck the island in July and December of 2002, respectively.

The FIA inventory design was adapted for the conditions and vegetation in Guam.

Analysis Methods
The FIA estimates of forest land are based on a system that uses aerial photography or satellite imagery to deﬁne different types of land (strata) across the landscape. The simplest stratiﬁcation is separating land into forest and nonforest strata. However, stratiﬁcations can be assisted or reﬁned by using ancillary data such as topography, soil information, life zone or climatically based information, and prior inventories of vegetation groups.
The Guam stratiﬁcation was conducted via a classiﬁcation of 2002 IKONOS satellite data, masking out and replacing clouds by using aerial photography taken

in 1994. The initial land cover classiﬁcation divided the landscape into forest, urban, nonforest vegetation, barren, and water land types. At least 10 percent cover of trees was used as the basis for the forest land classiﬁcation, and includes both agroforests and mangrove forests. Nonforest vegetation includes other vegetation types with less than 10 percent cover of trees. A geographic information system (GIS) was used to sum acreage for each type. Forest was further classiﬁed into volcanic and limestone forest types by overlaying a soils layer (USDA NRCS 1988) on the land-cover-classiﬁcation layer in a GIS. We used the GIS to individually
8

Guam’s Forest Resources, 2002

sum the acreage of limestone and volcanic forest types. From this limestone/ volcanic stratiﬁcation, ﬁeld plot condition types were expanded to the landscape level. The acreage each ﬁeld plot represents was derived by dividing the total acreage of forest in each of the limestone and volcanic soil types by the number of ﬁeld plots that fell within the geographic bounds of that speciﬁc type. Average stand size was expanded from the plots to the landscape level by using the same expansion factors. The forested areas on our initial land cover classiﬁcation will be further reﬁned into more detailed forest types in an ongoing project by the USDA Forest Service, Paciﬁc Southwest Region, Remote Sensing Laboratory.
Wood volume was estimated for individual trees by using tree height and two stem diameter measurements. These measurements are expanded to tree-level volume estimates by using equations for sections of a cone. Both gross stem volume and net stem volume estimates were calculated. Net stem volume subtracts damage and rotten defects from gross stem volume. Biomass for individual tree stems was estimated by using the speciﬁc gravity for known species (31 out of 50 species measured on Guam have known speciﬁc gravities). For species where speciﬁc gravity was not known, an average speciﬁc gravity, according to forest type, was used. These estimates of aboveground tree biomass are derived from bole volume and include only biomass for the main stem, excluding branches, roots, and foliage.
An additive combination of relative density and relative basal area (importance value IV) was used to classify forest types and assess the species dominance in a stand. Traditional site productivity estimates require forest stand age, derived from the annual rings of forest trees. Because tropical trees do not produce consistent annual rings, a modiﬁed topographic relative moisture index (TRMI) (Parker 1982) was used as a proxy for site productivity. The TRMI used a weighted, additive combination of slope steepness, slope shape, and slope position to assess the potential moisture retention in a forested stand. The TRMI serves as a proxy for productivity until we can obtain growth rate data from remeasurement of these plots. We recognize moisture is not likely to be the only factor limiting tree growth and that an excess of moisture can be detrimental to tree growth.

Because tropical trees do not produce consistent annual rings, an index based on slope characteristics affecting moisture retention was used as a proxy for site productivity.

Reliability of FIA Data
The area of land cover types mapped from the IKONOS classiﬁcation was assumed to be accurate and was used as the basis for the expansion of the numbers of trees, tree volume, and tree biomass from the plot scale to the forest-type scale. Possible sources of error not accounted for in our estimates include errors in the land cover map owing to incorrect interpretation of the image, errors from rounding when working with pixel-based imagery, and measurement errors on ﬁeld plots. Standard

In Guam, trees tend to be relatively small owing to disturbance by typhoons and historical land use practices.

errors for the expansion of our estimates from ﬁeld plots to the forested landscape were calculated according to the proportion of area occupied by either volcanic or limestone forest types. Volcanic and limestone forest areas were treated as known rather than estimated, and variance was calculated by using methods in Cochran (1977). Using one standard error as our basis for evaluation gives a 68 percent chance that the true total gross tree stem volume on Guam lies between 83,229,532 and 99,520,878 cubic feet. There is a 68-percent chance that the true number of trees (>1 inch diameter) on Guam lies within the range of 68,809,072 to 84,733,366.
Resource Highlights Land Cover
Based on the IKONOS satellite imagery, we estimate that Guam is approximately 48 percent forested, with an additional 33 percent covered by grass and shrublands. Barren lands account for slightly over 1,500 acres (1 percent), and urban lands total approximately 24,000 acres (18 percent) (ﬁgs. 1 and 4, table 2).
Productivity
Forest land productivity was approximated as the potential of a site to retain moisture (TRMI) (Parker 1982) relative to that particular broad soil-based forest type (limestone vs. volcanic; table 3). Topography at each plot was used to rank sites within a forest type in terms of whether water would be expected to accumulate on or ﬂow from the site. The limestone forests tended to occur on lands that would be classiﬁed predominantly (80 percent) as moderately high productivity (ﬁg. 5). However, when basing potential productivity on topography, one must consider that limestone soil and parent material quickly drain water owing to high porosity. This may lead to an overestimate of productivity depending on the moisture-holding capacity of the soil. Sixty percent of the area of volcanic forest was classiﬁed as moderately high productivity or higher (ﬁg. 6).
Forest Structure
Stand size class summarizes the predominant diameter of all live trees in a forested condition. In Guam, trees tend to be somewhat small in diameter, with the majority of forested area having trees in the 5- to 10.9-inch category (ﬁg. 7). No stands were sampled in this inventory for the 20+ inch category. Such large-diameter stands are expected to be rare on Guam owing to frequent disturbance by typhoons.
The diameter distribution for trees on Guam follows a typical “reverse-J” pattern (ﬁg. 8). More individuals are found in the smallest tree size classes (tables 4 and 5), which through time either grow into larger trees, die in the understory

as other individuals outcompete them for space, or are killed by typhoon or other damaging agents. Likewise, cubic-foot volume (ﬁg. 9, tables 6, 7, and 8), biomass (ﬁg. 10, table 9), and carbon mass (table 10) follow similar trends, with the majority of each distributed among the smaller tree size classes. For trees greater than or equal to 5 inches in diameter, the mean tree height is approximately 25 feet with a standard deviation of 11.3 feet. Approximately 63 percent of the trees fall within the height range of 15 to 30 feet, and about 30 percent of the trees are greater than 30 feet tall.

Guam’s Forest Resources, 2002

Number of Canopy and Understory Species
The ﬁeld sample of this inventory considers both overstory and understory vegetation. Understory vegetation cover was surveyed on ﬁeld plots for individual species that occupy at least 3 percent cover on an entire subplot (tables 11 and 12). Relatively rare species are not documented on plots unless they have been identiﬁed as a special-interest species by island foresters. More species were found in the limestone forest sample than in the volcanic forest sample (ﬁg. 11). However, the limestone sample area was over twice the area of the volcanic forest sample, and the number of species found tends to increase with the area sampled. These species ﬁgures are only a rough estimate of cover and species counts for the most common plants. Stone (1971) details 931 species in the ﬂora of Guam.
On a per-plot basis, using the sum of FIA subplot area of approximately onesixth of an acre (summing four subplots at 24-foot radius = 7,238 square feet), the distribution of tree species numbers reveals a pattern of a relatively high number of species per plot (ﬁg. 12). Plots where only one or two species are found are often plots dominated by the widespread Hibiscus tiliaceus, Casuarina equisetifolia, or the recently broadcast (aerial seeded after World War II) Leucaena leucocephala.
Tree Damage and Mortality
We estimate that about 20 percent of the individual trees on Guam have been damaged (table 13). These damages include mechanical damage from storms and people, diseases, insects, decay, and damage by other plant species. Approximately one-third of the damaged trees show signs of decay with visible growth of woodrotting fungus (conks) (ﬁg. 13).
Tree damages are categorized according to causal agents. Because a tree can exhibit secondary damages caused by another agent, we have classiﬁed damages according to frequency for the primary and secondary damage agents. Thirty-six percent of primary tree damages in Guam forests are attributed to weather (ﬁg. 14). Damage caused by other vegetation, insects, and diseases follow in declining frequency for primary damage types. Insects frequently play a secondary role following damage or weakening by another damaging agent (ﬁg. 15).
Tree damages can contribute to mortality at different rates for different species. Some species are more sensitive than others to insects, some to fungal, viral, or bacterial pathogens that gain entry into plant tissues through mechanical wounding. Overall, about 2 percent of the trees in our sample were dead. However, by species, the percentage dead ranges as high as 33 percent for breadfruit trees (Artocarpus altilis) in the inventory (ﬁg. 16).

About 20 percent of the trees on Guam have been damaged— most from weather, other vegetation, and insects.

Epiphytes
Epiphytic plants growing on trees use space and moisture that might otherwise be available for the growth of the host tree. Physical breakage of tree limbs can occur depending on the amount and species of plants growing in the branching network of the host tree. In extremely wet areas, the weight loading of epiphytes can be tremendous, stunting the growth of individual trees. We rated each tree sampled in the inventory according to epiphyte loading. The majority of trees on Guam show little evidence of epiphyte loading (table 14). Frequent storm damage to trees may prevent the accumulation of epiphytes to the point of tree limb damage on Guam.

Acknowledgments
The FIA Paciﬁc Island inventories are the result of cooperative effort between a number of groups and agencies. The USDA Forest Service, State and Private Forestry in the Paciﬁc Southwest Region has been a strong supporter of natural resource assessments in the Paciﬁc Islands. Many thanks to the Paciﬁc Islands Imagery Consortium partners for sharing costs on imagery and interpretation. Thanks to the University of Guam (UOG) for logistical support, to Lynn Raulerson at UOG for species identiﬁcation and training, to Lisa Fischer at the Remote Sensing Lab in the Paciﬁc Southwest Region for imagery interpretation and mapping support, and to Walter Grabowiecki, Dale Baer, Falaniko Mika, Ritofu Lotovale, Tony Gaison, Patrick Quenga, Vince Tenorio, Albert Blas, De’rick Baza, D’wuane Baza, and Vince Perez for ﬁeld assistance and logistical support. We also thank Dale Weyermann, John Chase, Chuck Veneklase, and Ron Wanek with FIA for GIS, programming, and technical support. Tom Brandeis, Dave Azuma, and Chuck Bolsinger offered very helpful comments on prior drafts.
