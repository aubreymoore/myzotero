TACTICS
Quarantine Limit accidental transportation to uninfested parts of Guam.
Pheromone Traps Capture adults and detect spread of the beetle population
Sanitation Kill immatures and remove breeding sites
Detector Dogs Efficient discovery of breeding sites.
Chemical Control Injectable systemics for adults; spot treatments for breeding sites.
Biocontrol Autodissemination of Oryctes virus

Initial Quarantine Area September 2007

PHEROMONE TRAPS
Mass trapping unsuccessful Traps useful for monitoring

Introduction
The following frames show spatial-temporal changes in numbers of CRB adults caught in pheromone traps. Note that trap catches on Guam are very low: the scale runs from 0 to only 0.02 beetles per trap day, a trap rate of only one beetle every 50 days.

Methods
Interpolated raster maps were made using an R script which: 1. Accesses georeferenced data stored in the CRB project’s online MySQL database. 2. Processes the data using the GRASS6 GIS 3. Writes the LATEX code which generated this PDF document.
