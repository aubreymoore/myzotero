1 Brief Description of Project
Funding in the amount of $20K is requested to be used as seed money to establish a project with the objective of ﬁnding a strain of Oryctes nudivirus (OrNV) which is highly pathogenic for the newly discovered Guam biotype of CRB (Marshall et al. 2015, Moore and Marshall 2015). The Guam CRB biotype, currently found in Guam, Oahu, Palau, Papua New Guinea, and Solomon Islands (Marshall et al. 2015, SPC 2015), is resistant to OrNV and is likely to spread to other islands. Prior to emergence of the Guam CRB biotype, OrNV was used as a very eﬀective classical biocontrol agent to mitigate damage whenever Paciﬁc islands were invaded by CRB (Bedford 2013). Introduction of the virus into a CRB population typically reduced damage by up to 90% and control lasts indeﬁnitely.
Given that CRB eradication for this species is very diﬃcult, achieved on only one island (Catley 1969) out of many where it has been attempted, it is very important to have a density-dependent biocontrol agent available for cases in which eradication fails (Guam) or an eradication attempt is not feasible. Despite signiﬁcant progress in development of eﬀective IPM tactics for CRB, these are not suﬃcient to limit CRB damage to acceptable levels without an eﬀective density-dependent biocontrol component.
In collaboration with Sean Marshall, AgResearch New Zealand, we have determined that the rhino beetle attacking Guam’s palms is genetically distinct that those elsewhere in the Paciﬁc, except for those invading Hawaii and part of the CRB population in Palau, and that this new biotype is apparently resistant to OrNV, which has been used as a very eﬀective density-dependent biocontrol agent for CRB wherever it has invaded Paciﬁc Islands.
Bioassays of several isolates of Oryctes nudivirus provided by AgriResearch New Zealand failed to result in signiﬁcant pathogenicity for the Guam CRB genotype. In a ’last ditch’ attempt we made a ’witches brew’ slurry containing all frozen dead beetles from previous bioassays plus frozen virus samples in vials. Forty adult beetles were forced to swim in the slurry for 30 minutes on January 22, 2015. A control group of 41 beetles were forced to swim in water. Beetles were checked weekly.
By May 10, 2015, mortality of the virus treated beetles (78%) was signiﬁcantly greater than that of the control group (54%).
This experiment is incomplete: a postmortem needs to done on the dead beetles and the ’witches brew’ process needs to be repeated to see if this also results in signiﬁcant mortality.
If additional funds become available, these will be used to hire Ian Iriarte, who did the original work, as a graduate assistant to repeat the ’witches’ brew bioassay. He will also help establish a biocontrol lab to facilitate discovery of an OrNV strain which is highly pathenogenic for the CRB-Guam biotype.
Although invasion by CRB-Guam is a regional problem, it is anticipated that Guam will be the location at which OrNV candidates from foreign exploration will be tested. The project PI already has USDA-APHIS permits to import OrNV and CRB into Guam. The graduate assistant will assist in establishing an insect pathology lab at the University of Guam to be used for applied research in CRB biocontrol.

3 Justiﬁcation and Urgency
The need to ﬁnd a strain of OrNV or other density-dependent biocontrol agent for the CRB-Guam biotype is urgent. In a worst-case scenario a population explosion of CRB on Guam could result in high palm mortality. The resulting dead palms would provide abundant CRB breeding sites, creating a positive feedback loop where even more CRB adults are generated, killing even more palms. An eﬀective density-dependent biocontrol agent for CRB-Guam, such as a highly pathogenic OrNV strain, is needed to counteract this feedback process.
A possible trigger for a CRB population outbreak on Guam is abundant green waste left in the wake of typhoons. Typhoon Dolphin past over Guam in May 2015, leaving much decaying vegetation behind. The Guam CRB population is expected to increase during 2015 and 2016, increasing the risk of accidental export of this pest to other islands.
