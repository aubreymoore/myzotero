Abstract

Coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros (L., 1758), is a large scarab beetle native to Southeast Asia and a major pest of coconut ( Cocos nucifera ) and oil ( Elaeis guineensis ) palms in its invaded range. Few tools are available for coconut rhinoceros beetle management, particularly for an emerging haplotype with resistance to known strains of Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus, the traditional biological control agent used in coconut rhinoceros beetle management programs. RNA interference (RNAi) represents an emerging tool for insect pest control that exploits an existing pathway for gene regulation in the target organism. In this study, we evaluated RNAi as a potential tool for coconut rhinoceros beetle management. Using transcriptome data generated from gut tissue of early instar larvae, we identified 24 RNAi target sequences that were either highly expressed or had demonstrated efficacy in other insect systems. Double-stranded (ds)RNAs ranging from 249 to 297 bp in length were generated for 23 of these target sequences and 150 ng were microinjected into coconut rhinoceros beetle 1 st , 2 nd , and 3 rd instar larvae and adults. Five of these dsRNAs that targeted genes putatively encoding V-type ATPase, polyadenylate binding protein, and three forms of actin induced 30.8–100% mortality within 14 days post injection (dpi). Microinjection of 2nd instars with 10 and 100 ng of these same five dsRNAs induced 20–100% and 80–100% mortality at 7 and 14 dpi, respectively. These results indicate RNAi should be explored as a possible management option for coconut rhinoceros beetle. Coconut rhinoceros beetle may also represent a model species for using RNAi in the management of large invasive insect species.

Invasive insect species are responsible for dramatic economic losses in agricultural and urban environments, negatively impact natural ecosystems, and pose risks to human and animal health. Together, the annual global impact of invasive insect species has been estimated at over US$70 billion ( Bradshaw et al. 2016 ). Coconut rhinoceros beetle ( Oryctes rhinoceros L.) is an example of a highly invasive and damaging palm pest that is spreading throughout the tropical Pacific region ( Catley 1969 , Gressitt 1953 ; Fig. 1 ). Coconut ( Cocos nucifera ) and oil ( Elaeis guineensis ) palms are preferred hosts, making coconut rhinoceros beetle a threat to the economy, culture, and food security of many Pacific Island communities ( Bedford 1976 , Bedford 1980 ). Outside of their native range, management of coconut rhinoceros beetle populations has largely relied upon biological control. Although the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium majus (formerly M. anisopliae var. majus ) has been shown to help reduce coconut rhinoceros beetle populations ( Ramle et al. 1999 , Gopal et al. 2006 ), in the last several decades it has been the introduction and successful establishment of Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) that has provided the best management option for coconut rhinoceros beetle ( Jackson 2009 ). In 2007, coconut rhinoceros beetle was found in the U.S. Territory of Guam ( SPC 2007 ). Multiple efforts to establish OrNV in the incipient coconut rhinoceros beetle population were unsuccessful ( Marshall et al. 2017 ). Genetic analyses of specimens collected from Guam’s coconut rhinoceros beetle population and a population discovered in Hawaii in 2013, revealed that these populations represented a distinct haplotype ( Marshall et al. 2017 , Reil et al. 2018 ) and that this lineage appears to possess resistance against known strains of OrNV ( Marshall et al. 2017 ). This apparent breakdown of a well-established biological control strategy has provided an impetus to develop new management approaches for coconut rhinoceros beetle.

RNA interference (RNAi) exploits a post-transcriptional RNA regulation pathway present in most eukaryotic organisms ( Hannon 2002 ). Cells react to double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA) molecules (or aberrant single-stranded RNA molecules by converting them to dsRNA) and cleaving them into 21–24 nt small interfering (si)RNAs. These siRNAs serve as sequence-specific guides in a multi-protein RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) which binds to and cleaves complementary RNA transcripts, making them prone to RNA degradation pathways (see reviews by Hutvágner and Zamore 2002 , Broderson and Voinnet 2006 , and Wilson and Doudna 2013 ). Much of this RNAi pathway, also known as ‘post-transcriptional gene silencing’, was first elucidated by plant biologists decades ago in efforts to understand and manage viral diseases of crops ( Depicker and Van Montagu 1997 , Waterhouse et al. 1998 ). In recent years, RNAi has become increasingly popular with entomologists in the study of insect gene function ( Bellés 2010 ) and the management of insect pests ( Gu and Knipple 2013 ). For the latter, the most common approach is to deliver RNAi elicitor molecules, such as dsRNA, that target a single gene or suite of genes that encode proteins essential to the health and/or survival of the insect ( Ulrich et al. 2015 ). Numerous genes have been identified that when targeted by RNAi cause a lethal or debilitating response by the insect ( Baum et al 2007 ). However, gene targets that are effective against some insect species or taxa are not always effective against others ( Cooper et al. 2019 ). Some insect taxa also appear less conducive to RNAi as a management tool than others ( Shukla et al. 2016 ), with genetic differences between taxa and/or dsRNA transport and degradation implicated as factors in this observation ( Terenius et al. 2011 , Shukla et al. 2016 , Guan et al. 2018 , Cooper et al. 2019 ).

In this study, we examine whether RNAi may be a potential management tool for coconut rhinoceros beetle by testing the efficacy of targeting select genes using dsRNA. With life stages that can weigh in excess of 15 g, coconut rhinoceros beetle represents perhaps the largest insect species for which RNAi has been evaluated and may represent a useful model in the management of other large invasive insect species using this technology.
Materials and Methods
Insect Source

All insect specimens used in this study were from a coconut rhinoceros beetle colony established using field-collected adults from the Pearl Harbor basin, Oahu, Hawaii. Field-caught specimens were quarantined for at least 7 d to ensure they harbored no obvious pests or pathogens before being transferred to the University of Hawaii’s Arthropod Containment Laboratory (UH-ACL). All coconut rhinoceros beetle life stages were reared in chipped green waste collected from the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus, which also served as a food source for larval stages. The rearing temperature was maintained between 28 and 30°C, and the medium was exchanged as needed. Adult beetles were fed peeled and sliced bananas at a rate of approximately 15g/beetle/week during normal rearing conditions and up to 50g/beetle/week during experimentation.
Transcriptome Generation, Analysis, and Gene Target Selection

Total RNA was isolated from 100 mg of gut tissue harvested from three coconut rhinoceros beetle larvae (1st instar) using a NucleoSpin RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel, Bethlehem, PA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The total RNA quality was measured using TapeStation (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). A TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) was used to generate an mRNA library which underwent high-throughput sequencing using a MiSeq platform (Illumina) at SeqMatic (Fremont, CA). The resulting 2x150 bp paired-end reads in FastQ format were trimmed and underwent de novo assembly in Geneious R10.2.3 (BioMatters, Auckland, NZ). Contiguous sequences were compared to accessions in the GenBank database using blastn and blastx algorithms ( Altschul et al. 1990 ). Our approach for target selection was to screen small batches of approximately 24–25 genes for effectiveness. If no effective targets were identified in a batch, another batch of genes would be selected and targeted. Gene targets with demonstrated RNAi efficacy in other insect systems, such as isoforms of actin ( Zhu et al. 2011 , Rosa et al. 2012 ) and V-type ATPase ( Baum et al. 2007 , Zhu et al. 2011 , Ulrich et al. 2015 , Laudani et al. 2017 ) were purposefully included in our initial batch. Other gene targets were selected based on high transcript abundance ( Table 1 ) or novelty (no homologous sequence was present in GenBank).

dsRNA Synthesis

Oligonucleotide primers targeting the genes selected for dsRNA synthesis were designed using the PrimerQuest Tool (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) ( Table 1 ). Amplicon criteria included a length of 230-290bp and primer annealing temperatures of 61.0–63.0°C. Reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR was performed using a 2 µl (~200 ng/µl) sub-sample of the total RNA used in the transcriptome generation as template. RT–PCR was performed using GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI) with the following cycling conditions: 95°C for 5 min; 30 cycles of 95°C for 60 s, 62°C for 60 s, and 72°C for 60 s; and 72°C for 7 min. Amplification products were analyzed for size by agarose gel electrophoresis. Products of the correct size were ligated into a pGEM-T Easy cloning vector (Promega) modified by replacing the multiple cloning region with a single Eco RV restriction site and insertion of a second T7 promoter immediately downstream of (and in the same orientation as) the existing SP6 promoter. A Sac I restriction site was introduced immediately upstream of one T7 promoter and a Hin dIII site was introduced immediately upstream of the other T7 promoter. Prior to ligation, the modified vector was digested with Eco RV then incubated with Taq DNA polymerase and dTTP (0.2 µM) at 72°C for 30 min to facilitate TA cloning. Amplification products cloned into the modified vector underwent Sanger-based sequencing to ensure the desired sequence was present and in the correct position for downstream manipulations. RNA transcription was performed on Sac I- and Hin dIII-digested vectors using the MEGAscript T7 Transcription Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA was heat-denatured at 80°C for 15 min and allowed to anneal at room temperature. The resulting dsRNA was quantified using a NanoDrop 2000 (ThermoFisher Scientific) and confirmed to be dsRNA using salt protection assays ( Bishop et al. 1965 ), in which subsamples were adjusted to 10 and 500 mM NaCl, exposed to RNase A (0.5 ng/µl) at 37°C for 60 min, and evaluated for degradation by agarose gel electrophoresis. The remaining dsRNAs were stored at −80°C.
Insect Assays

Unless otherwise specified, all coconut rhinoceros beetle specimens were injected with single aliquot containing 150ng of dsRNA and blue food coloring (injection dye) in a 1 µl volume using glass micro-pipettes. The injection site for larvae was between spiracles at mid-body and adults were injected immediately posterior of the rear leg. Specimens were evaluated at 7, 14, and sometimes 21 days post injection (dpi) for survival. The dsRNAs were initially screened by the injection of five 2nd instar larvae and three newly-emerged adults. Those dsRNAs which induced mortality in this initial screen were subjected to a more thorough evaluation on all larval stages and adults. For 1st, 2nd, and 3rd instars, a total of 15 specimens of each instar were injected. For newly-emerged adults, 13 specimens were injected. The titer of dsRNAs that induced mortality was also evaluated by injecting 10 or 100ng of dsRNA into a total of fifteen 2nd instar specimens per dosage. As experimental controls, specimens were also injected with injection dye alone and injection dye containing a nonspecific dsRNA derived from the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene of ti ringspot associated virus. Since larvae were reared in a chipped green waste medium that could vary in nutrient composition and/or contain harmful substances such as insecticides, elevated mortality in both colony specimens and experimental controls were occasionally observed when new batches of medium were used. To address these occurrences, assays in which the mortality of either of the control treatments exceeded 14% at the conclusion of the observation period were discarded.
Statistical Analysis

The mortality data for 10 ng and 100 ng injections of the 2nd instars were analyzed using R software ( R Core Team 2018 ) with the dplyr package ( Wickham et al. 2018 ). The data for each concentration at 7 and 14 dpi were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), using mean results by treatment followed by a Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) test for mean separation ( Tukey 1977 ).
Results
Transcriptome Analysis

High-throughput sequencing of an mRNA-enriched sample from gut tissue of 1st instar larvae produced a total of 30.3 million paired-end reads. Short (<100nt) and low-quality reads were filtered, and the paired reads were merged. These merged and the remaining unmerged reads were assembled into 71,626 contiguous sequences (contigs) without duplicates. From these contigs, a batch 24 potential target genes were identified as described in the Materials and Methods. These targets included four genes encoding peritrophic membrane proteins, three genes encoding isoforms of actin, three genes encoding serine proteases, and three genes of unknown function ( Table 1 ). Based on the number of reads, the most common transcripts encoded a G12-like protein (0.82% of total reads), peritrophic membrane proteins (0.73 and 0.72%), and a gene of unknown function (0.73%).
dsRNA Synthesis

RT–PCR amplification products of the expected size were generated for 23 of the 24 targets. Only dsRNA 20, derived from a gene encoding a protein of unknown function ( Table 1 ), was not amplified. Sanger-based sequencing confirmed the expected amplification products were ligated into the modified cloning vector. Following RNA transcription, subsamples that underwent a salt protection assay using RNase A underwent agarose gel electrophoresis. A product of the expected size was present for subsamples containing 500 mM NaCl, but degradation was apparent in samples containing 10 mM NaCl, confirming the double-stranded nature of the transcription products (data not shown).
Insect Assays

Initial screening of the dsRNAs was performed by micro-injecting 150 ng of each dsRNA into five 2nd instar larvae and three newly emerged adults. Five of the dsRNAs (dsRNA 1, β-actin; dsRNA 2, actin; dsRNA 16, vacuolar (V)-type ATPase; dsRNA 17, actin; and dsRNA 19, polyadenylate binding protein, PABP) induced >80% mortality in 2nd instar larvae at 7 dpi ( Table 2 ). These same five dsRNAs were the only dsRNAs evaluated that were also able to induce mortality in adults at 21 dpi ( Table 2 ). When each of these five dsRNAs were injected into 15 individuals of each larval stage and 13 adults, mortalities ranged from 0 to 100% at 7 dpi, and 30.8–100% at 14 dpi ( Fig. 2 ). Adult O. rhinoceros typically had lower mortality rates than larval stages. All control treatments had mortalities <14%. Experiments associated with one batch of green waste media that resulted in >14% control mortality and elevated mortality in the coconut rhinoceros beetle colony were discarded.

The effect of dsRNA titer on mortality of O. rhinoceros was evaluated by injecting, 2nd instar larvae (3 reps/5 larvae per rep) with 10 or 100 ng of dsRNA 1, dsRNA 2, dsRNA 16, dsRNA 17, and dsRNA 19. At 7 dpi, mortality was significantly ( F = 5.037; df = 2,6; P < 0.001) elevated for dsRNA 17 when injected with 10ng and significantly ( F = 20.68; df = 2,6; P < 0.001) elevated for dsRNA 1, dsRNA 2, and dsRNA 17 when injected with 100 ng in comparison to the two controls treatments ( Fig. 3 ).

Discussion

In this study, we generated and analyzed larval gut transcriptome data of O. rhinoceros for the purpose of identifying gene targets that could be utilized as RNAi targets. Of the 23 gene targets that were screened, dsRNAs targeting five of them were able to induce high rates of mortality in larval, and in most cases, adult life stages within 14 dpi. Of these five, three (dsRNA 1, dsRNA 2, and dsRNA 17) targeted distinct isoforms of the structural protein actin, one targeted the enzymatic protein V-type ATPase (dsRNA 16), and one targeted the RNA-binding PABP (dsRNA 19). Actin has been previously demonstrated as an effective RNAi target in insects such as glassy-winged sharpshooter ( Homalodisca vitripennis ) ( Rosa et al. 2012 ) and Colorado potato beetle ( Leptinotarsa decemlineata ) ( Zhu et al. 2011 ), as has V-type ATPase in western corn rootworm ( Diabrotica virgifera virgifera ) ( Baum et al. 2007 ), red flour beetle ( Tribolium castaneum ) ( Ulrich et al. 2015 , Laudani et al. 2017 ), and L. decemlineata ( Zhu et al. 2011 ). The effectiveness of targeting the PABP of O. rhinoceros appears to have less precedent in previous work in other insect systems. Although the iBeetle-Base ( Schmitt-Engel et al. 2015 ) reports 100% mortality at 11 dpi after pupal injection of T. castaneum with dsRNA targeting a PABP (TC009984; GenBank NC_007422.5: 10706516..10708311), this target was not evaluated in a parallel study screening for target genes for pest control ( Ulrich et al. 2015 ). Mutation of pabp is lethal in both yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) ( Sachs et al. 1987 ) and Drosophila melanogaster ( Sigrist et al. 2000 ), supporting the mortality observed when it was targeted in this study.

Only the adult stage of O. rhinoceros is damaging to palm hosts. Larval stages develop in decaying plant material and can be viewed as beneficial as they further break down this material into nutrient-rich compost. The immature stage is also long in duration, lasting up to 200 d (as reviewed by Bedford 1980 ). In this study, we found that some dsRNA target genes did not induce high (>80%) mortality in larvae until 14 dpi. Furthermore, lower dosages of dsRNA also appeared to delay mortality in 2nd instar larvae. Fortunately, management efforts targeting the larval stage of O. rhinoceros would not require the rapid mortality that is preferred for other insect systems where larval stages are damaging. This may allow a broader range of dsRNA delivery systems for future management efforts ( Joga et al. 2016 ). Oryctes rhinoceros larvae, however, live in and feed upon microbially-active decomposing organic material. Keeping dsRNAs functionally intact in such an environment may prove challenging. Insects that feed on organic waste often possess elevated antimicrobial peptide activity against potential pathogens ( Lee et al. 2016 , Elhag et al. 2017 ). It is, therefore, possible that ingested dsRNA will be further challenged by defense mechanisms in the gut of larvae that work to hinder infection by pathogens and other harmful agents present in their food source. Many sap-feeding insects including numerous aphid species (reviewed by Yu et al. 2016 ) and Asian citrus psyllid ( Diaphorina citri ) ( Hajeri et al. 2014 ) are susceptible to RNAi by dsRNA ingestion. As such, sap-feeding O. rhinoceros adults may also be more susceptible to RNAi by oral delivery than larvae. Challenges for managing adult O. rhinoceros using RNAi include the limited amount of time adults spend in the canopy feeding ( Hinckley 1973 ) and the delivery of a lethal dose of dsRNA into a palm canopy that maybe 30 m above ground level. Evaluation of dsRNA delivery systems for larvae and adults is a critical point of research, as is evaluating and any potential effects on non-target species. These challenges must be addressed before management tools using dsRNA can be implemented against O. rhinoceros in Hawaii and elsewhere. There are currently few approaches available for O. rhinoceros management or eradication, particularly for haplotypes that appear resistant to current viral biocontrol strategies. Chemical insecticide treatments are available for O. rhinoceros control ( USDA 2014 ), however, their use is often limited to ornamental palms and is not an option for many in the Pacific Region that utilize palm for food. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s 2017 registration of food crop products that incorporate RNAi in a stacked insect pest control strategy ( Head et al. 2017 ) represents a pathway for the use of RNAi in other pest management programs.

O. rhinoceros , the red palm weevil ( Rhychophorus ferrugineus ), and South American palm weevil ( R. palmarum ), are three highly invasive insects that threaten palm species in tropical and sub-tropical regions. This includes 11 endemic loulu palm ( Pritcharida spp.) species in Hawaii that are currently classified as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These also represent three large insects, with some life stages of R. ferrugineus , R. palmarum , and O. rhinoceros exceeding 5, 6, and 15 g in weight, respectively ( Giblin-Davis et al. 1989 , Dembilio and Jacas 2011 ). Laudani et al. (2017) demonstrated RNAi-mediated knockdown of α-amylase and ecdysone receptor genes, but not a V-ATPase gene, in R. ferrugineus by dsRNA injection and ingestion. This decrease in gene expression for the α-amylase and ecdysone receptor, however, did not translate into high insect mortality (no treatment exceeded 40% mortality at 7 dpi) despite using dsRNA dosages of 1,500 and 5,500 ng. Although the targeting of V-ATPase in R. ferrugineus did not result in gene knockdown, RNAi targeting of this gene in other insect species, including O. rhinoceros in this study, does induce mortality ( Baum et al. 2007 , Thakur et al. 2014 , Laudani et al. 2017 ). The increased mortality observed in our study with a larger insect species using 150 ng of dsRNA or less, suggests O. rhinoceros may be highly susceptible to RNAi and well suited as a model to represent the study of larger insect species using this approach. Long-term studies on the effect of down-regulating nonlethal genes would also be facilitated by the relatively simple rearing needs of O. rhinoceros and a captive lifespan that can surpass a year. The O. rhinoceros transcriptome generated for this study that is currently under annotation will complement the recently published draft genome of O. borbonicus ( Meyer et al. 2016 ) in providing important genetic information on scarab beetles. However, as demonstrated by this study, the increasing ease and decreasing costs involved with generating, annotating, and evaluating targets for RNAi will allow researchers working on understudied invasive insect pests better access to this tool as a management option.
