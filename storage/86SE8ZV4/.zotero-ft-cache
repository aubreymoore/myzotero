A new Stigmella feeding on Urticaceae from Guam: first records of Nepticulidae (Lepidoptera) from Micronesia and Polynesia
Erik J. van Nieukerken and C. van den Berg

Invertebrate Systematics 17(1) 27 - 37
Published: 24 March 2003
Abstract
Stigmella ebbenielseni , sp. nov. is described from Guam, where it was reared from leafmines on Pipturus argenteus (G. Forst.) Wedd. (Urticaceae). Vacated leafmines of this or a related species have also been recorded from Tinian and Alamagan. These provide the first records of the Nepticulidae from Micronesia. Similar mines, probably of a related species, have been recorded from herbarium material of Maoutia australis Wedd. originating from Tahiti; these confirm the occurrence of the family in Polynesia. Adult and mines of S. ebbenielseni are described and illustrated. The literature on Microlepidoptera of Pacific islands is reviewed and previous records of Nepticulidae are discussed. We conclude that Stigmella is probably widespread in the Pacific area, with at least four species, currently all associated with Urticaceae, tribe Boehmeriae.
