Effect of Juvenile Hormone Mimics on the Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle1,2,S
ANDRAE. DHONDTT". P. MCGoVERNa,n"d MORTOBNEROZA" ABSTRACT
Methoprene, hydroprene, and 1-(p-chlorophenoxy)-7,8- mone mimics in tests against pupae of Ory<:tesrhinoceros epoxy-4,8-dimethyl-3-decenewere effective juvenile hor- (L.) .

The coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros (L.) , is a serious pest of the coconut palm. Although the virus Rhabdionvirus oryctes Huger gives good control of the insect (Marschall 1970, Zelazny 1973a, b, Young 1974), it may still be necessary to avoid the accumulation of potential breeding sites (mostly rotting wood). \Vhen the palms of old plantations are felled, stems can be used for posts or charcoal (Little 1973), but the stumps are difficult to destroy. Insecticides can be used to protect the stumps from insect attack (Dhondt 1973) but since this could cause an environmental hazard, it was thought worthwhile to investigate the use of synthetic juvenile hormones (JR) or mimics as an alternative to persistent insecticides. Reported here are the results of trials with 53 such chemicals; of these, twenty-five were active.
MATERIALSAND METHoDs.-Pupae that were less than 24 h old were used. All pupae were reared in kapok-cowdung mixture in the project's mass-rearing facility. Their average weight was 8.7 g.

All the chemicals except no. 2 and 3 were synthe-

sized at the Beltsville laboratory and were at least

95% pure when analyzed by gas chromatography

Compounds 2 and 3 are products of Zoecon Corpora-

tion, Palto Alto, CA.

The following scale was used to rate the activity of

the chemicals. O=no effect (the beetle emerges from

the pupa alive with only slight or no deformation of

the elytra); l=the beetle emerges completely from

the pupal skin, but the wings are badly deformed and

at least remains of one or a pair of treated stridula-

tion organs (gin traps) are visible; 2=the beetle does

not completely emerge from the pupal skin, which

covers the abdomen; head and thorax are free; 3=

the pupal skin is only detached between the legs on

the ventral side of the thorax; 4=pupa died with

newly formed beetle inside; and 5=second pupa

(never observed) .

Experiments.-l.-lOOO-,

and 200-p.g amounts of

each chemical (equivalent to ca. 125 and 25 ppm AI)

were applied to the venter of the abdomen of indi-

vidual pupae.

2.- The 25 chemicals that had shown an effect in

the 1st experiment were retested. If the rating was

greater than 1, 200 JAowgere injected into the stridula-

tion organ. If the effect was slight (rating of 1), 400

JAowgere injected into the stridulation organ. Usually

the stridulation organ used was the one closest to the

thorax.

3.-Further dilutions of the chemicals were made

in acetone. In accordance with the results obtained

in the previous experiments, applications were made

at lower doses.

Though the number of coconut palm beetles in

infested areas is small, their potential for damage is

great. These low populations, even in infested areas, greatly limited the number of beetles available for our work and limited the number per test we could use.
RESULTS.-No activity could be discerned in the

pupae treated with 28 of the chemicals; further work with them was therefore abandoned."
Nineteen compounds that gave a response greater than I with the 1000 p.g dose were tested at lower dosages (Table I). Compound 3 (methoprene) gave very good results. Unfortunately, the solution was lost before it could be tested at dosages lower than 40 p.g AI/pupa. Compounds 2 and 22 still showed a slight effect at 4 p.g AI/pupa (equivalent to a rating of ca. 0.5) .
Six chemicals gave a slight response (rating I) with the 1000 p.g dose. These chemicals were retested in
experiment 2, 400 p.g being injected into the stridu-
lation organs of 2 pupae for each compound. Compounds 6, 7, and 21 did not show any effect at this dosage, compound II had a slight effect (rating 0.5) . Compounds 18 and 24· gave a good response, and pupae were treated with them at lower dosages (3rd set of data in Table I) .
Thus, a number of JH-mimics have an effect when applied topically or injected into young pupae of the rhinoceros beetle. The most effective compound was methoprene.
