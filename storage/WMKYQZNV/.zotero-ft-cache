Relative population densities of Aedes albopictus and A. guamensis on Guam
L. E. ROZEBOOM 1 & J. R. BRIDGES2
Aedes guamensis Farner & Bohart is indigenous to Guam but A. albopictus is known to have arrived in 1944. The larval ecology of the two species is very similar; both species breed in tree holes, coconut shells, and other natural and man-made water containers. The purpose of the study was to compare the relative densities of larval populations of the two species with those determined in a survey made in 1948-49. The results suggest that as the population density of A. albopictus increased, that of A. guamensis decreased by as much as about 95 % in artificial containers, and by 30 % or more in natural breeding habitats. Since there seems to be no environmental factor involved in rendering the breeding places unsuitable for A. guamensis, the reduction in A. guamensis populations may be, in part, the result of competition from A. albopictus.

Aedes guamensis Farner & Bohart (subgenus Stegomyia) is indigenous to Guam and other islands of the Mariana group. Since its most characteristic breeding habitat appears to be rot holes in trees, it is abundant in heavily wooded areas, which may be remote from human habitation. The larvae are also found in water trapped in coconut shells and in certain other plant cavities. Bohart & Ingram (1946) stated that A. guamensis is not a domestic mosquito, and that in a survey made in Guam in 1945 the larvae were never found closer than about 15 m to houses although " suitable containers " were present. In a survey made in 1948-49, Reeves & Rudnick (1951) frequently found the larvae in tin cans, rain barrels, and other artificial containers, and also observed that one-third of these containers were within about 30 m, and one-fifth within about 15 m, of houses. Some of the containers were actually leaning against the side of a house.
In 1944 there was an extensive outbreak of dengue on Guam. An intensive survey by Bailey & Bohart (1945) revealed that A. aegypti was abundant in all kinds of artificial container close to houses, but it was never found in association with A. guamensis. A control campaign resulted in the apparent eradication of A. aegypti from the island (Bohart & Ingram,

1946). Reeves & Rudnick (1951) suggested that the decrease in control measures around houses after the A. aegypti control campaign might have produced conditions that would enable A. guamensis to move into the peridomestic environment and utilize tin cans and other receptables associated with human activities as breeding habitats. It is possible that the elimination of A. aegypti created a biological vacuum that A. guamensis was starting to fill.
According to Hull (1952), A. albopictus (Skuse) was first discovered on Guam (at Ylig Bay and Yona) in 1944 by A. B. Weathersby. The species apparently remained rare for some time thereafter, and it was not recorded by Baily & Bohart in 1945. The species was found by Yamaguti and LaCasse at Yona in March 1948 (Bohart, 1956). In 1948 and 1949, Reeves & Rudnick found A. albopictus in many localities in the northern two-thirds of the island, and Bohart (1956) found it in the southern part (Merizo) in 1951. Bohart refers also to collections made in 1952 by Gressitt in Tutujan and by Hu on Mt Santa Rosa.
It is evident that A. albopictus has become widespread in Guam. Larvae of this species are abundant in the water that collects in troughs formed by split bamboo stems, in stumps of cut bamboo, and in coconut shells that have been opened by rats or man. The larvae occur not infrequently in tree holes although this habitat appears to be less attractive than the others. The species readily makes use of

various artificial containers in the immediate vicinity of houses, as well as those in woods and other areas farther from human habitation.
In laboratory experiments, A. albopictus kept in both small and large cages was observed to reduce greatly, or even to eliminate, competing populations of A. polynesiensis Marks (Gubler, 1970; Rozeboom, 1971). The situation on Guam offers an opportunity to observe whether A. albopictus has a similar effect on A. guamensis. Both A. guamensis and A. polynesiensis are members of the A. scutellaris subgroup, and their breeding habitats are very similar to those of A. albopictus. In theory, ecological homologues cannot coexist (de Bach, 1966). The purpose of the recent survey was, therefore, to attempt to measure the relative densities of the two species in their various habitats, and to determine whether the population density of A. guamensis had undergone a reduction, especially in the peridomestic environment previously inhabited by A. aegypti.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The survey was conducted on 17-31 July 1970 and on 16-20 November 1970. The first period was in the early part, and the latter was towards the end, of the rainy season. These are the most favourable times of the year for the development of these species, which depend upon rainfall to fill the small container habitats with water. Since A. guamensis females are not readily attracted to human or other bait, adult biting catches could not be used to measure the relative abundance of the two species. Nevertheless, adults were captured as they came to bite while the larval collections were being made. Light trapping is also not a satisfactory method of collecting these two species; therefore, it was necessary to rely on larval collections. All kinds of natural and artificial breeding habitats were examined. Selected areas included woods, coconut groves, bamboo thickets, and fields and premises adjacent to, or several hundred metres from, houses. An effort was made to obtain a complete census of each breeding container, but in a few collections from large containers it was possible to obtain only a sample.
All larvae and pupae were taken to the laboratory for identification. During the early part of the survey, when more time was available, many of the larvae were reared to the adult stage; adults were obtained also from the pupae and the identification of these specimens was based on the distinctive adult markings. In the November collections, limited time and

resources permitted the rearing of adults from pupae only; thus most specimens were identified as larvae. Larvae of A. albopictus have long anal gills, all 4 being approximately equal in length. The anal gills of A. guamensis larvae are short; the lower pair are shorter than the upper pair and are often almost bud-like. The separation of the larvae was based on the character of the anal gills, which appeared to be distinctive in not only the third and fourth instars but also in the second instar and even the first stages. Another characteristic feature is the lateral hair on the anal saddle; in A. albopictus it is double while in A. guamensis it has 3 or more branches. However, this was useful as a confirmatory character for the third- and fourth-stage larvae only.
Larvae were killed in hot water and identified immediately under a dissecting microscope. A blue glass filter placed underneath the shallow dish containing the larvae greatly enhanced the visibility of the gills.
In order to evaluate a change in population densities, it was necessary to compare the results of the latest survey with those of Reeves & Rudnick (1951). Through the generous cooperation of Dr Reeves, it was possible to examine the original collection records. In the 1948-49 survey, complete larval counts were not made, samples being taken instead. The actual numbers of specimens were recorded for some collections but for the others use was made of a frequency-distribution table, which was part of the collection sheets. The collector marked the box corresponding to his estimate of the number of larvae and pupae in the container, i.e., 0-1, 1-5, 10-20, etc. In our calculations of the relative numbers of larvae in each collection, the largest number was assigned to A. albopictus and the smallest to A. guamensis. Thus, if both species had been collected, and the 10-20 box marked, it was assumed that 19 specimens were A. albopictus and only 1 was A. guamensis. If only A. albopictus had been collected, and the 1-5 box marked, 5 larvae of this species were counted; however, if only A. guamensis was found, only 1 larva was counted. The reason for this procedure was to make certain that an increase in A. albopictus and a decrease in A. guamensis densities in the 1970 survey would not be influenced by an underestimate of A. albopictus and an overestimate of A. guamensis in the 1948-49 survey.
For purposes of comparison, the numbers of larvae calculated for 1948-49 are given in Table 1. The table also shows the actual numbers of collections recorded by Reeves & Rudnick (1951).

RESULTS
Additional locality records
A. albopictus has been collected in several localities that do not appear to have been listed in earlier surveys. They include Tarague Beach, Cetti Bay, Route 4 at La Sa Fua River, Talona, Inarajan, and about 1 km inland from Talofofo Bay. Evidently, A. albopictus has invaded most of Guam.
Adult human collections
As reported by previous workers, A. guamensis is rarely observed biting human bait. A. pandani was the most abundant mosquito but A. albopictus adults could have been collected in large numbers if an effort had been made to do so.
Collections from breeding habitats
Table 2 shows the number of times the two species were collected, i.e., the number of positive collec-

tions as well as the number of specimens. In these records, a single first-stage larva of A. guamensis was scored as an occurrence. A more revealing measurement of the relative densities of mosquitos is the actual numbers of larvae and pupae taken from the breeding habitats.
The preference of A. guamensis for tree holes is very evident; of the 24 holes in which larvae were found, A. guamensis was present in 20 and A. albopictus in only 13. Of a total of 598 A. guamensis larvae found in natural habitats, 332 (56%) were in tree holes. Furthermore, in 5 of these holes there was a total of 195 A. guamensis but no A. albopictus. The high organic content of the water appeared to be attractive to the former species but repellent to the latter. Nevertheless, A. albopictus is not uncommon in tree holes, including small, narrow cavities containing only a few ml of water.
Altogether, 68% of specimens from all natural breeding habitats and 82%, 75 %, and 88 %, respec-

tively, ofthe larvae and pupae from bamboo, coconut shells, and palm bracts belonged to the species A. albopictus. It is of interest to note that shells of the giant African snail, Achatina fulica Bowdich, lying on the ground in wooded areas, often contain A. albopictus larvae and pupae.
The predominance of A. albopictus is far more striking in collections from artificial containers, the species being over 6 times more frequent than any other; in tin cans the ratio was more than 12:1. Of 4695 specimens in artificial containers only 4.5% were A. guamensis, and there were only 80 A. guamensis in the 76 tin cans that were positive for larvae. Furthermore, 62 of these specimens came from a large tin can (about 2 litres capacity) partially buried in mud, heavily shaded by a dense canopy of low tree branches, and containing a thick deposit of decaying leaves and other debris. Ecologically, this

habitat was probably more nearly related to a tree hole. Except for 7 larvae of A. oakleyi, the can contained only A. guamensis. If this collection is excluded, only 18 A. guamensis, larvae and pupae, i.e., less than 2% of the total number, were taken from cans.
Of the artificial containers, tires were the most prolific source of A. guamensis. The respective numbers of A. albopictus and A. guamensis from 5 of the 7 tires examined were as follows: 395, 38; 259, 14; 207, 7; 929, 35; 782, 30. Three of the tires were lying within 15-30 m of a house, and two were at the edge of a clearing that appeared to be at least 1 km distant from any dwelling.
A comparison of larval associations found in the 1970 survey with those reported by Reeves & Rudnick (1951) is presented in Table 3. In the earlier survey, A. albopictus was collected more frequently with

Proximity to houses
In Table 4 the collection data have been rearranged to show the proximity of mosquito breeding places to human habitations. It can be seen that in natural containers the frequency and density of A. guamensis increases with the distance from houses. In artificial containers there was no correlation between the abundance of either species and proximity to houses.

DISCUSSION
In their 1948-49 survey, Reeves & Rudnick (1951) identified larvae of A. guamensis and A. albopictus in 203 and 113 collections, respectively. The increase in the distribution and abundance of A. albopictus in
Guam is quite evident from the results of our survey. Formerly, A. guamensis was more often the species inhabiting breeding places that it now shares with A. albopictus. On the other hand, A. albopictus now occurs more often in single populations.
Most of the single populations of A. guamensis occurred in tree holes, and in some of these the water was foul or contained a heavy accumulation of organic debris; this may have been a factor in excluding A. albopictus. Furthermore, this kind of habitat may be a residual " ecological niche " in which A. guamensis can survive without competition from A. albopictus. However, even in such habitats the ratio of A. albopictus to A. guamensis larvae and pupae was over 10 times that observed in 1948-49, i.e., 1: 1.5 against 1: 18. Reeves & Rudnick (1951) made many of their tree-hole collections near human habitations and they considered that if they had searched more extensively in jungle areas, the proportion of A. guamensis would have been much higher. Their original collection records show that at least 18 of the tree holes in which A. guamensis were found were situated at a distance of 1.5-30 m from houses. The two tree holes containing A. albopictus were 15 m from a house. In the 1970 survey, only 2 tree holes within 15 m of a house were sampled, and they contained only A. albopictus. It is possible that if more collections had been made near houses, the proportion of A. albopictus would have been much higher.
The ratio of A. albopictus to A. guamensis in coconut shells was 1:1 in 1948-49, and 2:1 in the

482

L. E. ROZEBOOM & J. R. BRIDGES

1970 survey. The calculated proportions of larvae
were 56.7% and 43.3% in 1948-49 while in 1970
75 % were A. albopictus. A comparison of all collections from natural breeding habitats shows that whereas in 1948-49 A. albopictus represented 37 % of
the total population, the proportion had increased to 68 % in 1970.
The difference between the relative numbers of occurrences and larval densities in artificial containers in the two surveys is far more striking. The ratio of A. albopictus to A. guamensis increased from 1: 1.6 to 6.6: 1; in cans the ratio was 1: 2.9 against 12.3:1.
In 1970 a total of 4 915 specimens were collected from artificial containers; 95.5% were A. albopictus and 4.5 % were A. guamensis. In 1948-49 the calculated proportions of these species were 47 % and 53 %, respectively. The calculated numbers of A. albopictus and A. guamensis larvae in cans in 1948-49 were 22 and 102 while in 1970 the actual numbers were 1 080 and 80 (including the 62 from the atypical can). Thus in 1948-49 over 80% of the larvae in cans were A. guamensis but in 1970 only about 7 % belonged to this species.
The question, however, is not whether there has been an increase in the population density of A. albopictus, but whether there has been a decrease in the density of A. guamensis. Unfortunately, a census is not available for the populations that occurred in former years; in the survey made by Reeves & Rudnick (1951), samples of larvae and pupae only were taken. Nevertheless, these stages were randomly selected, and should reflect the relative densities of the two species. From the original records, it was calculated that in artificial containers, 47% of the specimens were A. albopictus and 53 % were A. guamensis. These calculations gave the maximum possible densities for A. albopictus in the 1948-49 survey, and it seems justified, for the sake of simplicity, to consider this as a 50:50 ratio. Thus, there were 100 A. guamensis larvae for every 100 A. albopictus larvae captured, but in the recent survey there were only 4 or 5 A. guamensis larvae for every 100 A. albopictus larvae. This implies that for every 100 A. guamensis larvae found formerly in artificial containers, there now are only 4 or 5. If indeed the density of A. guamensis is now only 5 % of its former level, this species has undergone a reduction of about 95 % in artificial container habitats.
It is necessary to ask whether this reduction has been the result of further changes in the environment or of competition with A. albopictus. The fact that

some A. guamensis larvae and pupae were taken from artificial containers near houses shows that these breeding habitats have not become unsuitable; no environmental factors could be detected that would have caused a reduction of the A. guamensis population in artificial containers near, or even some distance away from, human habitations. Many of the containers were in environments where, irrespective of the proximity of houses, conditions should have been favourable for A. guamensis.
In forests and coconut groves situated far from permanent dwellings, A. guamensis is maintaining itself, especially in tree holes. The species seems to be capable of existing in water with a higher content of decomposing organic material than that preferred by A. albopictus. Even so, there appears to be a steady encroachment by A. albopictus into these habitats. It was calculated that in 1948-49, 63 of every 100 larvae from natural breeding places belonged to the species A. guamensis but in the recent survey only 32 of every 100 larvae from natural containers were of this species. This indicates a reduction of about 50%.
The possibility should also be considered that instead of a decrease in the density of A. guamensis, there was only an increase in that of A. albopictus. However, to judge from the size of the larval populations in those localities where A. albopictus had become established, it appears unlikely that even in 1948-49 the A. albopictus larval populations, existing at a 1: 1 ratio with those of A. guamensis, would have been as small as the present populations of A. guamensis, especially in artificial containers. In a survey made in 1951, Hull (1952) collected A. albopictus 117 times and A. guamensis 17 times. Although Hull (op. cit.) did not determine the relative larval densities, the ratio of A. albopictus to A. guamensis in his collections is actually higher than the ratio we obtained. This implies not only that larval densities of A. albopictus were high and possibly comparable to those we observed, but also that there was a considerable replacement of A. guamensis by A. albopictus between 1949 and 1951. It is of interest also to refer to Hull's conclusion that A. albopictus was more successful than A. aegypti as a competitor of Culex quinquefasciatus.
It is recognized that in the absence of more thorough larval censuses in previous years, certain assumptions must be made; the conclusions reached can therefore be only tentative. Nevertheless, there seems to have been a change in the relative proportions of the two species, brought about by an appar-

POPULATION DENSITIES OF AEDES ALBOPICTUS AND A. GUAMENSIS ON GUAM

ent increase in the density of A. albopictus and a reduction in that of A. guamensis, especially in artificial containers. This may have been caused by a change in the environment that we were unable to detect. Another possibility is that on Guam a natural

experiment may be taking place in relation to competitive exclusion between two mosquito species that are almost, if not exactly, ecological homologues. A reexamination of the developments in the future may be of considerable interest.

RESUME
DENSITES RELATIVES DES POPULATIONS D'AEDES ALBOPICTUS ET D'AE. GUAMENSIS A GUAM

Aedes guamensis, espece indigene de Guam et d'autres iles de l'archipel des Mariannes, est essentiellement un moustique des regions boisees. Cependant, en 1948/49, on a constate sa presence dans des gites naturels ou artificiels a proximite immediate des habitations, oii il a probablement pris la place d'Ae. aegypti, elimine en 1946. Ae. albopictus, decele a Guam pour la premiere fois en 1944, a depuis lors envahi la quasi-totalite de l'ile. Les deux especes presentant des caracteristiques ecologiques similaires, notamment en ce qui concerne le choix des gites, on a voulu etudier 1'evolution de leurs populations en comparant leurs densites relatives a 20 ans d'intervalle.
En 1948/49, une prospection a permis de recolter Ae. albopictus 24 fois et Ae. guamensis 59 fois dans des gites naturels, 86 fois et 140 fois dans des gites artificiels. En 1970, les chiffres correspondants ont ete de 88 et 51 (gites naturels) et de 118 et 18 (gites artificiels). Une comparaison portant sur le nombre d'individus de

chaque espece identifies lors des deux enquetes a montre que dans les gites naturels, les proportions d'Ae. albopictus et d'Ae. guamensis etaient en 1948/49 de 37,0 et 63,0%; en 1970, elles etaient de 67,9 et 32,1 %. Dans les gites artificiels, on a recolte en 1948/49 47,0% d'Ae. albopictus et 53,0% d'Ae. guamensis; en 1970, les chiffres correspondants ont et de 95,5 et 4,5 %.
Il semble donc que durant la periode consider6e le rapport entre les populations des deux especes ait et modifie: forte diminution de la densite d'Ae. guamensis et augmentation correspondante de la densite d'Ae. albopictus dans les gites artificiels, surtout aux abords des habitations, et, dans une mesure moindre, remplacement d'Ae. guamensis par Ae. albopictus dans de nombreux gites naturels. L'eviction d'Ae. guamensis est peut-etre due a des facteurs de milieu non identifies, mais elle peut aussi resulter d'une concurrence entre deux especes homologues du point de vue ecologique, Ae. albopictus affirmant sa suprematie.
