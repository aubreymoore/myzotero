Abstract
The prey range of the invasive Asian paper wasp, Polistes chinensis antennalis, was studied using molecular diagnostics. Nests of paper wasps were collected from urban residential and salt marsh habitats, larvae were removed and dissected, and DNA in the gut of the paper wasp larvae was ampliﬁed and sequenced with cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI). Seventy percent of samples (211/299) yielded medium-to high-quality sequences, and prey identiﬁcation was achieved using BLAST searches in BOLD. A total of 42 taxa were identiﬁed from 211 samples. Lepidoptera were the majority of prey, with 39 taxa from 91% of samples. Diptera was a relatively small component of prey (three taxa, 19 samples). Conclusive species-level identiﬁcation of prey was possible for 67% of samples, and genus-level identiﬁcation, for another 12% of samples. The composition of prey taken was different between the two habitats, with 2.59 more native prey species being taken in salt marsh compared with urban habitats. The results greatly extend the prey range of this invasive species. The technique is a more effective and efﬁcient approach than relying on the collection of “prey balls”, or morphological identiﬁcation of prey, for the study of paper wasps.

Introduction
Paper wasps (Polistes) are widely distributed around most of the globe and are diverse and common in many landscapes (Reeve 1991; Carpenter 1996). They are a very well-known model organism for the evolution of eusociality and behavior (Turillazi 1996; Starks and Turillazzi 2006). Despite this, little is known about the speciﬁcs of their foraging behavior; the range of prey taken; and how these may change seasonally, spatially, or with competition (Kasper et al. 2004; Brown et al. 2012). Paper wasps are likely to inﬂuence many other species in terrestrial ecosystems because they are voracious predators of invertebrates (Richter 2000; Nannoni et al. 2001; Kumar et al. 2009).
Several species of paper wasps have also become invasive around the world: P. versicolor (Olivier) in the Gal⬚apagos, P. dominula in North America, and P. humilis (Fabricius) and P. chinensis antennalis P⬚erez both in New

Zealand (Beggs et al. 2011). One hypothesis for the successful invasion of P. dominula in the USA is the broad range of prey it utilizes (Cervo et al. 2000). In New Zealand, the Asian paper wasp (P. chinensis antennalis) can reach densities of up to 210 nests/ha, translating into ~1000–2000 wasps/ha, and many 10,000 of prey captured per season (Clapperton 1999; Fig. 1). Consequently, there are concerns that Asian paper wasps could have a signiﬁcant impact on the native invertebrate fauna in native habitats (Clapperton 1999). Thus, it is important to know the details of a species’ foraging behavior and its precise prey range to better understand the role of paper wasps in native ecosystems and the impacts of invasive paper wasp species.
Traditionally, prey items of social wasps are collected from foraging wasps as they return to the nest in the form of a “pellet” or “prey ball” (a masticated partial remain of a prey carried by the worker wasp) and identiﬁed (Harris 1991; Gambino 1992; Harris and Oliver

1993; Clapperton 1999). However, the identiﬁcation based on the morphological features of prey from highly masticated prey balls is likely to affect accurate identiﬁcation and also underestimate the range of prey. For example, Gambino (1992) could only identify ~17% of prey items using morphology and suggested that this may favor features that are more easily observed, thus inﬂuencing identiﬁcations and conclusions. This was supported by Kasper et al. (2004) who found only 39% of P. humilis prey could be identiﬁed using morphological features.
Molecular identiﬁcation of the prey of social wasps has been examined recently by Wilson et al. (2009) who examined the prey of the yellowjacket, Vespula pensylvanica. Molecular identiﬁcation of prey balls showed the wide breadth of prey consumed and helped quantify the direct and indirect effects on native ecosystems in Hawaii. However, while the collection and analyses of prey balls are suitable for Vespula wasps (because of their large nests and high foraging rates), the collection of prey balls is extremely time-consuming for paper wasps, which have much smaller colonies.
In this paper, we utilize molecular diagnostics to examine prey range of the Asian paper in New Zealand wasp and compare the prey taken from two different habitats.

Nests were collected from two habitats in the austral summer of 2012 and 2013 (Table 1). In urban habitats, nests were collected from wooden fences, residential gardens, and plantings of native shrubs, from six sites in Auckland (suburbs of St Johns and Glenn Innes; À36.878, 174.838) and from one site in central Whangarei (À35.721, 174.314). In salt marshland habitats, nests were collected from short (<2 m high) plants (typically Coprosma and Corokia) from ﬁve sites in Auckland city: Tahuna Torea Reserve (À36.871, 174.883), Devonport (À36.817, 174.794), Hillary Street reserve (À36.804, 174.780), Tuft Crater (À36.802, 174.749), O’Neill’s Cemetery (À36.810, 174.780); and two sites in the wider Auckland region: Huia (À36.997, 174.567) and Omaha (À36.342, 174.772).
Nests of the Asian paper wasp were discovered by walking slowly along walking tracks and through urban and salt marsh habitats. Nests were sprayed with household ﬂy spray to disperse adult wasps, while the nest was removed and placed in a plastic bag. Bags were subsequently kept at À20°C until the larvae were removed from the nest with forceps, and their “gut” was dissected for molecular analysis. Nests ranged in size from 68 to 186 cells (4–8 cm diameter). The number of larvae removed from a nest largely depended on the size of the nest, but the range of larvae removed was from 1 to 6 (Fig. 2). In most cases, a maximum of six larvae were removed from a single nest, and larvae were taken from around the sides rather than from just one section of the nest. For two nests, we removed larger numbers of larvae (n = 9, 17) in order to examine raising sample sizes on the number of species identiﬁed. Not all larvae were removed from nests and sequenced because of ﬁnancial constraints. In total, 299 larvae were sequenced, but the total number of larvae in all the nests was >500.
DNA extraction, ampliﬁcation, and sequencing
DNA was extracted from the gut of the paper wasp larvae. Samples were digested in 500 lL of DXT buffer (Qiagenâ, Hilden, Germany) and 5 lL of proteinase K

and incubated overnight at 56°C. DNA was then extracted in an automated extraction machine (QIAxtractorâ, Hilden, Germany) following manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was eluted in 70 lL of DXE (Qiagenâ) and then stored at 4°C for immediate use. Selective polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ampliﬁcations of a short region of 307 bp of the Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) was employed to target the gut content because the primers used have low afﬁnity with Hymenoptera (Rougerie et al. 2011). PCR ampliﬁcation was carried out in 15-lL reactions containing 1 9 PCR buffer (with 2 mmol/L MgCl2), 0.2 mmol/L dNTP and 1 U of FastStart Taq DNA Polymerase (Roche Diagnostics), 0.4 lL of 0.01% BSA, and primers LepF1 (5′-ATTC AACCAATCATAAAGATATTGG-3′) and MLepR1 (formerly named MH-MR1) (5′-CCTGTTCCAGCTCCATT TTC-3′) (Hajibabaei et al. 2006) with 5 lL of DNA. Thermocycling conditions were 5 min of initial denaturation at 94°C; a touchdown of 10 cycles of 40 sec at 94°C, 40 sec at an annealing temperature decreasing 0.5°C every cycle from 55°C to 50°C, and 1 min at 72°C, followed by 38 more cycles of 40 sec at 94°C, 40 sec at 50°C, 1 min at 72°C; and a ﬁnal extension of 5 min at 72°C. PCR products were sequenced directly using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystemsâ, Foster City, CA) and then analyzed on an ABI310 capillary sequencer. Resulting sequences were edited using Geneious R.6 created by Biomatters (http://www.geneious.com).
DNA identiﬁcation of prey
Identiﬁcation was achieved using the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) identiﬁcation engine to search the full DNA barcode records in BOLD for a match. In all cases, the probability of placement (%) at a given taxonomic level was recorded. When a species-level match was unavailable, the

nearest match was recorded. However, we cross-checked all suggested matches with the most recent taxonomic index for New Zealand (Gordon 2010) and especially for Lepidoptera (Hoare 2010), which made up the majority of records. We took a conservative approach and did not list a prey item to species, or genus, level unless a high BOLD match and the taxa were listed in Hoare (2010).
Results
DNA ampliﬁcation and sequencing
Two hundred and ninety-nine samples were submitted for molecular analysis, from which 70% yielded mediumto high-quality sequences used for prey identiﬁcation. There was some repetition of prey taxa recorded from the same nest; however, multiple prey species (>1 taxa) were present in 50% of nests (Fig. 2). The average number of prey taxa identiﬁed from a single paper wasp nest was 1.8, with a maximum number of four prey taxa identiﬁed from a single nest. However, this is dependent on the number of larval sequenced from each nest, which was not the same for each nest. In general, the number of prey taxa identiﬁed from a single paper wasp nest was signiﬁcantly lower (v2 = 50.09, df = 5, P < 0.001) than the number of larval samples sequenced from a nest, because of repetition of the same prey species.
Identiﬁcation of prey
A total of 42 taxa were identiﬁed from 211 samples (Table 2; Fig. S1). Lepidoptera (butterﬂies, moths) were the majority of identiﬁcations, with 39 taxa (93% of total) and 192 samples (91% of total). Diptera (ﬂies) was a relatively small component (three taxa, 19 samples) of prey. Conclusive species-level identiﬁcation of prey was possible for 67% of samples, and genus-level identiﬁcation was obtained for another 12% of samples (Table 2). Matches to species level, or genus level, could not be conﬁdently obtained for 20% of samples, including all Diptera and some taxa from three of the largest subfamilies of Lepidoptera (Geometridae, Noctuidae, Tortricidae).
Of the Lepidoptera, 24 species (62%) are endemic or native, and ﬁfteen species (38%) are introduced species in New Zealand. None of the endemic species are threatened (Stringer et al. 2012). However, several of the introduced species are considered pests, and some of them are economically important (Tooman et al. 2011).
Comparison of habitats
There was a signiﬁcant difference between urban and salt marsh habitats in the composition of prey species caught

by paper wasps (ANOSIM R value = 0.294, P = 0.01, Fig. 3). There was a signiﬁcantly higher proportion (odds ratio 2.59) of native species preyed upon in the salt marsh habitat compared with urban habitat (2 9 2 contingency table, v2 = 10.08, df = 1, P < 0.05). Common species prey upon were Mythimna separata (Cosmopolitan Armyworm) and Lampides boeticus (Pea blue butterﬂy), both introduced, and common native species were Poecilasthena pulchraria and Ectopatria aspera (Table 2).
Discussion
Molecular diagnostics of prey items show that the Asian paper wasp is a generalist predator on a very wide range of prey. Asian paper wasps consumed a number of introduced pest species, and some of them are economically important (e.g., Helicoverpa armigera, Epiphyas postvittana) and may have a beneﬁcial role in some areas such as residential gardens or commercial crops. For example, Gould and Jeanne (1984) showed that by preying on Pieris rapae caterpillars, Polistes wasps improved the weight and quality of cabbages.
Our results also show that a number of native species were also predated upon. There is existing anecdotal evidence that Asian paper wasps have an impact on native species. Of most concern are impacts on already vulnerable species of native Lepidoptera. Although by consuming a wide range of prey, the impacts on a few speciﬁc species may be less severe. However, population level impacts have not yet been undertaken.
Molecular identiﬁcation of the gut contents is becoming increasingly common for a wide range of invertebrates (Rougerie et al. 2011; Derocles et al. 2012; Gariepy et al. 2012), particularly for providing information that is time-consuming or difﬁcult to obtain by conventional rearing or gut dissection, for example, host ranges of

parasitoids (Rougerie et al. 2011; Derocles et al. 2012), or vertebrates hosts of tick species (Gariepy et al. 2012).
For wasps, molecular methods offer a signiﬁcant advantage over identiﬁcation based on morphology, where visual identiﬁcations are not fully representative of the types and proportions of prey taken (Kasper et al. 2004). The technique demonstrated here is more accurate than identiﬁcations based on morphology. In this study, 50% of prey species (21 from a total of 42 taxa) were identiﬁed to species and 67% to genus (28 of 42). This compares with only 20% species-level identiﬁcation (45% to genus) with morphological identiﬁcation for the same paper wasp species (Clapperton 1999).
However, identiﬁcations based on molecular methods depend largely on the availability and accuracy of sequences in molecular databases. We believe our percentage level of species identiﬁcation could be greatly improved, but molecular databases are currently lacking many associated sequences/taxa from New Zealand. For example, only 33% (9/27) of the endemic or native taxa could conclusively be identiﬁed to species level using BOLD, but 87% (13/15) of introduced taxa could be identiﬁed to species. This notion is further supported by very limited extent of publically available records of “Lepidoptera” from New Zealand (150 sequences, 53 #BINs, 24 species; BOLD search 30/5/2013). Several such “gaps” in molecular databases have recently been explored (Virgilio et al. 2010; Kvist 2013).
Although our results are consistent with prey items previously found for paper wasps in New Zealand (Clapperton 1999), the molecular approach used in this study might have overlooked any Hymenoptera prey (especially bees) because the primers used have low afﬁnity for this group. In addition, the occurrence of multiple prey species, as in Kasper et al. (2004), could have been missed. Other molecular techniques such as next-generation sequencing could be used to overcome DNA mixtures, but these methods can be time-consuming and highly expensive.
The technique of collecting paper wasp larvae from the nest is far more time-efﬁcient than collecting prey balls from foraging workers. Clapperton (1999) found that, on average, an Asian paper wasp worker returns to the nest every 2–5 min, but only one-third of these have a prey balls food pellet (other foragers carry debris for nest building, liquid food, or return without anything). Thus, on average, only 4–10 prey balls could be collected per hour. Clapperton (1999) collected 103 prey balls from 27 nests over 1 month. For P. humilis in Australia, Kasper et al. (2004) collected 44 prey balls from 514 foragers (a return rate of 0.08 prey balls per wasp or 12 wasps needed for one prey balls). These data show that collecting food prey balls from foraging paper wasps as they return to the nest is a very time-consuming task. Con-

versely, the technique demonstrated here presents data for 211 samples from 62 nests, collected over 9 days (partial) in the ﬁeld. Furthermore, not all nests were collected during these trips, some being left for additional studies. In addition, not all larvae were removed from nests and sequenced. In total, 299 larvae were sequenced (70% were successful), but the total number of larvae that could have been sequenced was >500.
Another signiﬁcant advantage of using molecular identiﬁcations is that further taxonomic identiﬁcations can be made to sequences in the future (e.g., lower levels of taxonomic information can be added), or identiﬁcations can be changed. This is not possible for morphological identiﬁcations, particularly as samples are often discarded at the end of the study. Thus, the use of molecular identiﬁcations provides an ongoing resource and potentially a collaborative one (e.g., Smith et al. 2012), which can greatly improve knowledge of a particular species or diversity at speciﬁc locations.
In conclusion, molecular diagnostics have shown the Asian paper wasp to be a generalist predator on a very wide range of prey, possibly contributing to its success as an invasive species. This technique may open further avenues for studying the foraging behavior and diet of paper wasps, a neglected aspect of this relatively well-known group.
