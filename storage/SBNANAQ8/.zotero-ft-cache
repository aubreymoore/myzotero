Using Scrapy to Extract Scientific Names from PestNet Fact Sheets

PestNet serves a couple of hundred excellent pest fact sheets on its site at http://www.pestnet.org/fact_sheets/index.htm. Unfortunately, these are indexed only by vernacular names. I want to hyperlink to sheets using scientific names. So I wrote a scrapy script to crawl the site and scrape the section from each page which contains scientific names.

  from  scrapy.spiders  import  CrawlSpider ,  Rule 
from  scrapy.contrib.linkextractors  import  LinkExtractor 
import  re 

class  someSpider ( CrawlSpider ): 
    name  =  'crawltest' 
    allowed_domains  =  [ 'www.pestnet.org' ] 
    start_urls  =  [ 'http://www.pestnet.org/fact_sheets/index.htm' ] 
    rules  =  (  Rule ( LinkExtractor ( allow = ()),  follow = True ,  callback = 'parse_item' ),  ) 


    # Let's capture scientific names 
    def  parse_item ( self ,  response ): 
        log  =  'scientific_names_log.md' 
        s  =  str ( response . body ) 
        searchObj  =  re . search (  r'<a name="Scientific Name"(.*?)<a name=' ,  s ,  re . M | re . I ) 
        if  searchObj : 
            result  =  searchObj . group ( 1 ) 
        else : 
            result  =  "Nothing found!!" 
        with  open ( log ,  'a' )  as  f : 
            f . write ( '{} {} \n ' . format ( response . url ,  result )) 
        return 

The script was invoked from the terminal using:

  scrapy runspider scrapePP.py -s DEPTH_LIMIT = 1

Here are the first few lines from scientific_names_log.md :

  http://www.pestnet.org/fact_sheets/mini/index.htm Nothing found!!
http://www.pestnet.org/fact_sheets/batiki_blue_grass_eye_spot_207.htm > </a><h1  class= ""  style= "False" > Scientific Name </h1><P><EM> Curvularia ischaemi </EM></P> 
http://www.pestnet.org/fact_sheets/bean_pod_borer_037.htm > </a><h1  class= ""  style= "False" > Scientific Name </h1><P><EM> Maruca </EM>  <EM> vitrata </EM> ; it used to be known as <EM> Maruca testulalis. </EM></P> 
http://www.pestnet.org/fact_sheets/bean_lace_bug_253.htm > </a><h1  class= ""  style= "False" > Scientific Name </h1><P><EM></EM> &nbsp; <EM> Corythucha gossypii </EM></P> 
http://www.pestnet.org/fact_sheets/bean_phaseolus_rust_217.htm > </a><h1  class= ""  style= "False" > Scientific Name </h1><P><EM> Uromyces appendiculatus </EM>  \r\nvar. <EM> appendiculatus. </EM>  Previously <EM> Uromyces \r\nphaseoli. </EM>  </P> 

As you can see, there was still some work to be done to clean this up. I used the atom editor to delete the extraneous bits and saved urls and scientific names to pacific_pests_insects.csv . Note that this file contains info only on arthropod pests.
