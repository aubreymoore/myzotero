V(D). Planned Program (Activity)
1. Brief description of the Activity
The University of Guam Cooperative Extension Service's Plant Health and Pest Management group performed educational outreach to the public sector, private sector, and government agencies. Subject areas covered included pesticide application, Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies, plant propagation, insect identification, weed identification, plant disease identification, soil nutrition and fertilizers, invasive species, and grafting. The group also provided plant disease diagnostics and insect identification for the island through the Cooperative Extension Service's Plant Health Clinic. To improve the flow of information regarding Guam's plant diseases among the scientific IPM communities and extension practitioners, an update of the Index of Plant Diseases in Guam was produced that was originally funded by a WSARE Professional Development Program grant EW-14-006 in 2014. With current CPPM/EIP funding this publication was updated through new reports and a new literature search and published in June 2018. The index can be found here: http://cnas-re.uog.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Submitted_Index-of-Plant-Diseases-in-Guam-Version2-07142018.pdf The Guam Plant Health and Pest Management group was able to assist extension, research and University of Guam instructional program in plant diagnostic related activities. A total of 863 plant disease inquiries were made of the Center (579 were handed informally and another 284 were logged and handed formally). Clients included students, farmers, gardeners, landscapers, Guam Plant Quarantine, and researchers. The Guam Plant Health and Pest Management group provided quick simplified answers on production and IPM issues for beginning farmers and gardeners. Three full page newspaper articles were published in a local newspaper to provide the basic information necessary to deal with Guam's most common disease. These articles concentrated on the disease anthracnose. The three articles vegetable emphasis was cucumber, papaya, and hot pepper, respectively. The IPM emphasis area was PAMS approach to IPM: Prevention, Avoidance, Monitoring, and Suppression. The three articles were placed in the printed version of the Guam Pacific Daily News. One of the articles was also placed in the online version and can be found here: https://www.guampdn.com/story/life/2018/08/21/home-garden-tips-combating-anthracnosecucumber/1039854002/ An IPM workshop was performed for science students at a local high school. Students were taught the basics of gardening/farming and IPM practices to identify and manage pests and diseases. Pre and posttests were given to the students to assess their knowledge gained. The average gain in knowledge was 33%. A six question evaluation questionnaire indicated the 90% "strongly agreed" that the workshop was worthwhile and successful. In order bring greater awareness of Phellinus noxius brown root rot disease to the community of Guam

and the region, a newspaper article was submitted Guam Pacific Daily News. The article was published online and can be found here: (http://www.guampdn.com/story/life/2017/10/17/tree-killer-fungusguam/7670030Tomato crops in Guam were surveyed to determine the presence or not of Ralstonia solanacearum (RS) and Tuta absoluta (tomato leaf miner). Surveys indicated that all fields were negative for Tuta absoluta and RS although RS was present in eggplant and pepper. Giant Cavendish bananas that are semi-resistant to Fusarium wilt were propagated at the WPTRC-Guam Department of Agriculture tissue culture facility and around 1000 plants were distributed to farmers.
2. Brief description of the target audience
