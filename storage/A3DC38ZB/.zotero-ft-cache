1.0 INTRODUCTION

1.1 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

Pursuant to an Interagency Service Agreement (Agreement) between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Marine Force Pacific (MARFORPAC), and the Department of Defense (DoD), the USFWS was contracted to conduct surveys of marine and terrestrial resources of some of the islands in the Mariana archipelago. The DoD is authorized to contract with appropriate Federal agencies under the provisions of the Sikes Act of 1960, as amended (31 U.S.C. 868) to promote planning, development, maintenance, and coordination of wildlife, fish and game conservation and rehabilitation on military reserves. This Agreement was developed in order to determine what resources may be impacted during the relocation of the U.S. Marine Corps Forces from Okinawa to the Mariana Islands and during training activities planned for various locations in the Mariana Islands.
Under the terms of the Agreement, some of the terrestrial surveys were conducted in 2008. The following report includes the results of the surveys conducted on the islands of Tinian and Aguiguan, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Further survey work will occur archipelago-wide in the following several years.

1.2 BACKGROUND

Tinian (100 square kilometers (km)) is the second largest island in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (Figures 1 and 2). It is 20 km long and 7 km at its widest point and the highest points on the island are Carolinas Ridge (178 meters (m)) and Mount Lasu (160 m) (Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg 1998). Aguiguan is a small island (7 km2) approximately 9 kilometers south of Tinian (Figure 3). It is approximately 5 km long and 1.5 km wide at its widest point and the highest point on the island is 163 m (Engbring et al. 1986).

Both Tinian and Aguiguan constitute the Municipality of Tinian in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. In 2000, the population on Tinian was approximately 3,540 people, with the majority in the village of San Jose (U.S. Census 2008), while

Aguiguan is uninhabited. The climate on both islands is tropical and temperatures remain and relatively consistent during the year, ranging daily from 25 degrees to 30 degrees Celsius. Rainfall varies considerably between years but averages 218 centimeters annually, most of which falls from July to November. A dry season occurs between January and May when rains diminish to 8 to 15 centimeters per month.
Approximately 80 percent of arable land on Tinian was put into sugarcane production during the 1930s (Bowers 1950). Tinian was also the site of a major U.S. beach landing during WWII and much of the island developed into a major airbase to support bombing operations on Japan (Rottman 2004). The airbase was abandoned after the war but the Department of Defense currently leases approximately two-thirds of the northern part of the island for training purposes. Currently, training consists of once a year battalion size exercises that last for about two weeks and occasional helicopter touch and go practice along the airstrip for the rest of the year.
Aguiguan was also partially developed by the Japanese for sugar cane production and for timber harvest during the 1930s (Davis 1954). However, it

INTRODUCTION
The first large scale land cover mapping of islands in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands was undertaken by the Forest Service in the 1980s (Falanruw et al. 1989). This mapping effort included the islands of Tinian, Rota, and Saipan but did not include the other islands in the archipelago. These maps were developed using 1976 aerial photographs and site visits during the 1980s (Falanruw et al. 1989) and an earlier version of these estimates were included in Hawaiian Argonomics (1985) and Engbring et al. (1986). Engbring et al. (1986) also mapped the land cover on Aguiguan as part of their bird surveys of the island sometime during the 1980s using 1968 aerial photographs.
In 2006, new land cover maps for Tinian, Rota, and Saipan were developed by the Forest Service. These updated maps were developed using 2.3-meter IKONOS (GeoEye®, Dulles, VA) multispectral data and 0.6-meter Quickbird (DigitalGlobe®, Longmount, CA) pan-sharpened natural-color imagery collected in 2000 or 2001 and fieldwork conducted in 2005 (Liu and Fischer 2006). Unfortunately, the remaining islands in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands were not mapped during this effort.
In 2008, the Department of Defense contracted the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Pacific Islands Fish and Wildlife Office to conduct terrestrial and marine surveys on Tinian and Aguiguan. The following report outlines the results of updating the Forest Service’s 2006 land cover map of Tinian using recent satellite imagery and the development of a land cover map of the island of Aguiguan.

METHODS
Tinian We utilized the Forest Service’s 2006 land cover map of Tinian as our base map for evaluating habitat changes since this map was completed. A copy of this vegetation map is available online on the Forest Service’s national website - http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/spf/ fhp/fhm/landcover/islands/index.shtml. This map was created utilizing satellite imagery from 2000 or 2001 and fieldwork conducted in 2005 (see Liu and Fischer 2006 for more detailed information on how this map was created). Because the imagery utilized to develop this map was over five years old, we utilized 2006 DigiGlobe® satellite imagery of the island to note any new clearings or roads. Areas that were recently cleared were delineated directly on the digital image using ArcMap 9.2 (ESRI, Redlands, CA). These areas were then reclassified in the Forest Service vegetation cover layer using ArcTools (ESRI, Redlands, CA) and new acreages for each cover type were calculated using XTools Pro 5.2.0 (Data East, LLC, Novosibirsk, Russia).
Due to the different land cover categories used in the Forest Service’s recent assessment of Tinian (13 categories) and their assessment in the 1980s (16 categories), it was not possible to assess overall land cover changes between the two time periods. However, Engbring et al. (1986) reported land cover estimates for Tinian in similar categories to those in the 2006 Forest Service assessment. These estimates were based on an early version of the land cover maps presented in Falanruw et al. (1989). Unfortunately, the methods utilized to develop both of these land cover estimates were not the same and so direct comparisons of acreages would not be appropriate. Therefore, we compared percent land cover in each of the land cover categories provided by Engbring et al. (1986) for the two time periods. As the 2006 Forest Service estimate included more land cover categories then those provided by Engbring et al. (10 categories) we combined several categories. Specifically, agroforest-coconut was combined with agroforest, casuarina (Casuarina equisetifolia) thicket was combined with mixed introduced forest for the secondary forest category, and urban vegetation was combined with urban.
Aguiguan The land cover map of Aguiguan was produced using 0.6-meter resolution, 2001 QuickBird imagery as the primary source. Areas under cloud cover were assessed using 2006 imagery of the island in GoogleEarth (Google, Inc., Mountain View, CA). Six land cover types were delineated: native forest, secondary forest, tangantangan (Leucaena leucocephala) thicket, open field, coastal scrub, and non-vegetated. These categories were selected because they were identifiable and corresponded with important bird habitats. Native forest consisted of primarily native trees growing on limestone substrate. Important components of the forest included Pisonia grandis, Cynometra ramiflora, Erythrina variegata and Guamia mariannae. Secondary forest consisted primarily of forest dominated by Delonix regia, Acacia confusa, Pithecellobium dulce, and Casuarina equisetifolia trees in the canopy. Tangantangan thicket is a type of secondary forest almost exclusively dominated by Leucaena leucocephala. Open fields were dominated primarily by introduced Lantana camara but patches of Chromolaena odorata and Miscanthus spp. were also found in these areas. Coastal scrub included low scrubby
9

species like Pemphis acidula and non-vegetated areas were primarily bare rock areas along the coast. Land cover types were differentiated based on differences in tone, texture, pattern, and color and were delineated directly on the digital image using ArcMap 9.2. Aerial photographs of Aguiguan from 1948 (black and white, 1:24,000), 1968 (black and white, 1:20,000), and 1994 (color, 1:20,000) were also utilized to assist with delineating secondary forest and limestone forest habitats. All images were registered using a second-order polynomial transformation with at least seven ground control points per photograph. A draft land cover map was ground-truthed in June and August 2008 and any changes were incorporated in the final land cover map.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Tinian Five sites on the island were identified as having been cleared or modified since the Forest Service’s vegetation assessment of the island between 2001 and 2006 (Figures 1 and 2). All of these sites were previously disturbed and consisted of open fields, secondary forest, tangantangan thickets, and mowed or maintained areas (Table 1). Their clearing and modification resulted in their conversion to urban land cover (Table 1).
All modifications were incorporated into the Forest Service’s 2006 land cover map and the total acreages for each land cover type were calculated (Table 2). Tangantangan thickets were the dominate cover type (34 percent of the island) followed by mixed secondary forest (27 percent) and other shrub and grass (19 percent). Native limestone forest only made up 5 percent of the land cover while urban areas (urban and urban vegetation) made up approximately 7 percent of the island.
When the recent land cover estimates were compared to those developed in the 1980s several changes were noted. First, overall coverage of open fields decreased while coverage of secondary forest increased (Table 2). This may be a result of succession over the last two decades as open areas are abandoned and claimed by secondary forest. A decrease in tangantangan was also found in addition to an increase in urban land cover (Table 2). The increase in urban cover is likely the result of increased development on the island (including homesteads, casinos, and the airport expansion) and the decline in tangantangan and open fields may also be associated with this development.
Aguiguan The dominate land cover types on Aguiguan ranked from highest to lowest were native forest, open field, secondary forest, tangantangan thicket, no vegetation/barren, and coastal scrub (Table 3, Figure 3). Aguiguan is currently uninhabited, therefore urban and agricultural field cover types were not recorded. When compared to the land cover estimates by Engbring et al. (1986) for the 1982 surveys, the percentage of the island in open field decreased while the percentage in secondary forest and tangantangan increased (Table 3). This shows a transition from open field habitats to secondary forest type habitats over the two survey periods. Interestingly, tangantangan was not included in the landcover for 1982 despite it being a common landcover type on the neighboring islands of Tinian and Saipan (Engbring et al. 1986). Engbring et al. (1986) report a few small
10

patches that were less than 5 hectares in size. Apparently the larger patches currently found on Aguiguan grew sometime during the last two decades. Based on the present state of extensive browsing of goats (Capra hircus) in this habitat type (Figure 4), the growth of tangantangan may have occurred when goat populations were suppressed between 1989 and 1990 (Rice 1991). An assessment of some areas currently containing tangantangan thickets with recently acquired aerial photographs of the island appears to support this theory (Figure 5). The emergence of tangantangan was observed on Sarigan Island after the eradication of goats (C. Kessler, USFWS, pers. comm.) and supports the theory that goats suppress this type of tree.

INTRODUCTION
A general entomological survey was conducted on the island of Tinian, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) from August 6-15, 2008; this survey included one day of survey work on the island of Aguiguan on August 12, 2008. In addition to generally surveying predominantly native limestone forest areas on Tinian and Aguiguan for native and nonnative arthropod species, surveys to determine the presence or absence of two butterfly species, Vagrans egistina and Hypolimnas octocula mariannensis (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) and their documented host plants were conducted. The primary efforts of the general entomological surveys involved a focus on the insect ecology within the native forest areas including those possibly associated with the two candidate butterflies. In particular, the status of insect species which may threaten the butterflies’ host plant species or the butterflies directly through predation or parasitism was assessed. In addition, survey efforts were focused on ascertaining the presence/absence of invasive species of medical and socio-economic importance (i.e., mosquitoes, ants, termite, etc.), and additionally, aquatic species which may potentially be impacted within the project area (i.e., leased military training areas).
Prior Arthropod Surveys Based on a review of available literature, very few entomological surveys have been conducted on the island of Tinian. The most comprehensive report found was delivered to the United States Navy (Contract N62742-84-C-0141) from Hawaiian Agronomics (International), Inc. in December, 1985. Hawaiian Agronomics spent a total of seventeen days from November 1984 to November 1985 over the course of four separate visits, collecting insects (including Lepidoptera) utilizing various methods of collection and accounting for temporal differences. The purpose of this study was not outlined in the report and one may only deduce that the intent was to produce a general status report for arthropods on the island at the request of the Navy. Hawaiian Agronomics spent a total of 355 field hours during their study, of which 102 hours were spent visiting coastal, mixed, and scrub limestone forest. Approximately 250 field hours were spent surveying a wide variety of sites across the island including San Jose, village, farms, tangantangan forest, wetlands and ponds, pastures, and even 10 hours at the primary dump (landfill site).
In their report, Hawaiian Agronomics provided a general discussion of their efforts and results by general habitat type, (i.e., wetlands, tangantangan forest, etc.), but did not describe survey results within specific localities. The overall conclusion of the report was a high abundance, yet low diversity of insects on Tinian. A single paragraph described results of efforts surveying within the upper elevation, mixed limestone forests. Notably, ants were listed as the most common insect collected, followed by termites. Other insects collected in these areas as described by the report included microlepidopterans, leafhoppers, wood-boring and girdling beetles. Within the leaf litter of these mixed limestone forest areas, Hawaiian Agronomics collected mites, centipedes, millipedes, flies, collembolans, and thysanurans.

The 1995 Hawaiian Agronomics report describes encounters with the nonnative wasp species, Polistes stigma (Family Vespidae) in some of the disturbed habitat areas surveyed. Specifically, the report describes the nests of this species occurring as close together as 10 feet in proximity within tangantangan and other nonnative secondary forest. However, no account of this species was given for surveys within the limestone forest areas surveyed. Interestingly, the Hawaiian Agronomics report briefly stated that no rare, threatened, or endangered species of insects or arthropods were observed within the areas surveyed; however, the date of the surveys precluded the establishment of Federal candidate arthropod species within the CNMI.
Candidate Butterfly Species Currently, Vagrans egistina and Hypolimnas octocula mariannensis (Family Nymphalidae) are listed as candidates for listing under the Endangered Species Act. Both butterfly species are considered rare and have been recorded only on the islands of Saipan, Rota and Guam (Schreiner and Nafus 1996). Vagrans egistina was last collected on Guam in the late 1970s and on Rota in the1980s and 1995. Hypolimnas octocula mariannensis is historically known from Guam and Saipan and after an intensive survey for this species in 1995, investigators found only 10 populations on the island of Guam and none on the island of Saipan (Schreiner and Nafus 1996). During intensive surveys for these species in November of 2000 within the USFWS Ritidian Point Wildlife Refuge, only adults of H. octocula mariannensis were observed (M. Richardson, USFWS, pers. comm. 2008).
During their 1985 survey of Tinian, Hawaiian Agronomics collected 275 lepidopteran specimens comprised of 14 families, 36 species, and 10 unidentified species. Neither Vagrans egistina nor Hypolimnas octocula mariannensis were among the species collected, although neither species had been previously recorded on Tinian. The report does describe the difficulty encountered in differentiating the several species of adult nymphalid butterflies that were observed flying during their surveys. While neither species have ever been observed on Tinian, it is certainly possible, due to the close proximity of the islands in the Marianas archipelago and with episodic weather events, such as typhoons, that V. egistina or H. octocula mariannensis may have been distributed to islands outside of their known ranges in the past, including the island of Tinian. This is particularly true for those islands which do currently (including Tinian and Aguiguan) or have in the past, supported their host plants. Although not overtly cryptic, both V. egistina and H. octocula mariannensis are known to be fast fliers and only a trained biologist is likely to make a positive confirmation of their presence on islands where they have not been previously recorded.
The recorded host plant for Vagrans egistina is Maytenus thompsonii (Family Celastraceae), a small tree/shrub endemic to the Marianas and found primarily in the understory of native limestone forests (Vogt and Williams 2004, Schreiner and Nafus 1996). The recorded host plants for the Hypolimnas octocula mariannensis are Procris pedunculata and Elatostema calcareum, both forest herbs (Family Urticaceae) found growing on limestone outcrops in native limestone forest (Schreiner and Nafus 1996).

METHODS AND MATERIALS
Prior to arriving to Tinian for our August 2008 survey efforts, the following primary objectives to be modified as needed or as circumstance required were formulated:
Tinian 1st Priority Goals: • Survey for the butterflies and host plants within remnant native forest areas on military lands. • Survey for nonnative insect threats to the butterflies (predators/parasitoids) and to the host plants (true bugs, etc.) on military lands. • Survey for other possible native insects, including aquatic species such as the odonates on military lands.
Tinian 2nd Priority Goals: • Survey for the butterflies and host plants within remnant native forest areas on NON-military lands. • Survey for nonnative insect threats to the butterflies (predators/parasitoids) and to the host plants (true bugs, etc.) on NON-military lands. • Survey for other possible native insect species on NON-military lands. • Survey for presence/absence of other important alien arthropod groups including mosquitoes and ants.
Aguiguan (Goat Island) Goals • Survey for the butterflies and host plants within remnant native forest areas • Survey for & collect nonnative insect threats to the butterflies (predators/parasitoids) and to the host plants (true bugs, etc.) • Survey for & collect other possible native insects including aquatic species such as the odonates. • Survey for presence/absence of & collect other important nonnative arthropod groups including mosquitoes and ants.
The habitat areas selected for surveys were identified using maps and reports prepared by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Department of Defense biologists between June and August 2008. Due to the limited amount of time available for us to conduct the surveys, we decided to spend no more than a portion of each work day surveying along known or recently constructed transects within each of the several identified limestone forest sites. Most sites were visited during the daylight hours, although some sites were visited during the night to check traps or to run a blacklight. Equipment and methods used during surveys of terrestrial areas included sweep netting of vegetation, visual inspections of vegetation, caves, under rocks, and beneath rotting vegetation. Use of baiting and traps were also employed. For aerial insects, the following traps types were utilized: UV light with sheet and water pan, EVS light trap with LED light, BG Sentinel trap with BG-lure and Octenol lure, and a collapsible cone trap with protein bait. Ants were collected in every locality by hand collection, sweeping, aspiration, and with the use of 3”x5” index cards baited with both peanut butter and honey. Aquatic localities were surveyed directly by wading, use of a kayak, sweeping, use of a mosquito dipper, and benthic sampling
22

with a D-frame aquatic net. All collection sites and transects are shown in Figures 1 through 4.
During visual searches for Vagrans egistina and Hypolimnas octocula mariannensis and their host plants, our own knowledge of the species as well as an information guide produced by USFWS personnel were utilized. The information guide provided photographs of both butterflies and their host plants as well as descriptions of the larval stages of the butterflies. Geographic positioning system (GPS) points were taken of all transects within each locality surveyed. Additionally, to facilitate future monitoring efforts, points were recorded for all host plants located during each survey. A total of 21 host plants sites were located on Tinian and 3 host plant sites were located on Aguiguan during our surveys. Nine host plant sites were located on Department of Defense leased land (see Figure 1 - Japanese Caves Transects North and South and Chiget Cliff ) and 15 on CNMI public lands (see Figure 3 - Carolinas Nature Trail and Figure 4 - Aguiguan).
Identification of some specimens was completed by USFWS and Department of the Navy entomology staff; these specimens were submitted to the Bishop Museum, Department of Entomology for cataloguing and permanent storage. The majority of specimens collected were submitted to the Bishop Museum, Department of Entomology for identification, cataloguing, and permanent storage. See Appendix A for a list of all specimens collected during this survey.
RESULTS
A description of the survey efforts within each locality by date is outlined below. Note, within these descriptions, common names are primarily used; please refer to Appendix A for scientific names of all collected specimens.
August 7, 2008 – Lake Hagoi (Inside Military Lease Area) Coordinates: UTM 55 15.068083 145.625033 Habitat Type: Aquatic/Semi-aquatic and Mixed Introduced/Tangantangan Forest One entomologist spent approximately 4 hours surveying this site and surrounding vegetation Access to Lake Hagoi was attempted from the road east of the lake. Aerial observation during the flight from Saipan to Tinian indicated the water level was low and that the lake had only two small pockets of open water. Navigation to the open water portions of the lake was extremely difficult due to the dense vegetation that surrounded the area. The water/mud-ooze level within the vegetation gradually deepened toward the center of the lake area, and once the reed portion of the lake area was reached, the water and mud was knee-deep, and passage by foot was no longer possible. A D-frame aquatic net was used to sample the water amidst the reeds and the substrate at the beginning of the reed area of the lake. An adult damselfly, damselfly nymphs, an adult aquatic beetle, aquatic beetle larvae, water boatmen, a spider, and aquatic snail shells were collected. There were many adult damselflies flying amongst the reeds, and they all appeared to be of the same of species. After leaving the lake area and returning to the entry point on the road east of the lake, insects were collected by net along the road. Specimens collected
23

included an adult dragonfly, two different species of leaf footed bugs, a carpenter bee, and one Nymphalid butterfly species.

In the evening a UV light trap was set up by one entomologist at the intersection southeast of the lake. The trap consisted of an ultraviolet bulb set against a white sheet with a pan of soapy water at the bottom. The trap was engaged just prior to sunset and then checked after approximately three hours. The trap was checked again the following morning prior to dismantling. Winged termites (alate form) were immediately attracted to the illuminated sheet and collected by hand. A water strider was attracted to the trap and was collected. The large marine toad, Bufo marinus, was also attracted to the trap due to large amount of insects swarming around the light. Upon checking the trap after three hours of operation, the toads had knocked over the pan of water. Specimens were salvaged from spilled water as much as possible. Aquatic species were targeted for collection, therefore water boatmen and other various adult beetles were collected while many of the flies and moths were not. Particularly abundant were what appeared to be koa haole, or tangantangan, moths, Macaria abydata. On the same evening (August 7th), one entomologist set up a separate light trap west of the Lake. An established path that ran north from the road south of Lake Hagoi was used to locate a survey site west of Lake Hagoi. Before sunset (6:45 PM), an EVS light trap with a white LED as a light source and a BG-Sentinel trap with BG-Lure and Octenol lure were set up in the survey area in a shaded area. The BG-Lure mimics chemicals produced by human skin, and the Octenol lure has mosquito pheromone-like properties.

August 7, 2008 – Mount Laso (Inside Military Lease Area) Coordinates: (Not Available) Habitat Type: Mixed Native Limestone Forest This site was visited by one entomologist for approximately 1 hour. An established trail from the shrine at Mount Laso that runs south was used to locate a survey site. The survey site was near the beginning of the trail in a shaded area. An EVS light trap with a white LED as a light source and a BG-Sentinel trap with BG-Lure and Octenol lure were set up in the survey area before sunset.
August 7, 2008 - Japanese Villiage Ruins (Inside Military Lease Area) Coordinates: (Not Available) Habitat Type: Nonnative Shrub and Grassland One entomologist set up an EVS light trap with a white LED as a light source was set up in an area off the road that leads to the Japanese Village Ruins away from direct sunlight. The EVS trap was set up before sunset, between Eighth Avenue and the arch that remains as part of the Japanese Village Ruins.
August 8, 2008 – Near Japanese Village Ruins (Inside Military Lease Area) Coordinates: (Not Available) Habitat Type: Nonnative Shrub and Grassland and Mixed Forest and / Mixed Native
Limestone Forest One entomologist attempted to locate a semi-permanent pond that was in the vicinity of the Japanese village ruins. The intent was to collect aquatic insects. Unfortunately, there was no trail to this pond and passage through the grass and vegetation was very slow.
25

After approximately two hours, the search for the pond was abandoned and insects were collected along the road that leads past the ruins. A variety of butterflies were collected in this area, along with a large species of plant bug. There were also some adult dragonflies in the area, but capture of these fast flying insects was not possible. One of the dragonflies looked very different from the common red colored species – its coloration appeared to be grayish blue with maybe some yellow markings. At the end of this road, a small patch of native forest was found. Within the fringe of this native forest area, subterranean and drywood termites were collected from a living tangantangan tree and a dead coconut palm.
The EVS trap and BG-Sentinel traps at this location were checked. Both traps had failed to capture mosquito specimens, yet they were filled with a large number of fungus gnats. A decision was made to forgo setting subsequent mosquito traps at this location based on trap rate and time constraints.
August 8, 2008 - Lake Hagoi
(Inside Military Lease Area) Coordinates: UTM 55 15.068083 145.625033 Habitat Type: Mixed Nonnative / Tangantangan Forest This site was again visited by one entomologist for approximately 2 hours. Trapped specimens were collected from the EVS trap and BG-Sentinel trap that were placed west of the lake. Before sunset (6:44 PM), a blue LED light source was placed in the EVS trap, and the BG-Sentinel trap with BG-Lure and Octenol lure was reset. Before sunset at this location, an entomologist collected mosquitoes off of himself with an aspirator. Mosquito identification is pending authorization to utilize the taxonomic services of Bishop Museum.
Also in the evening the UV light trap was engaged, however on this occasion it was placed just off the road north of the lake area. Nothing new was collected in the trap relative to what was caught the night before. The koa haole, or tangantangan, moth was again present in high numbers.
August 8, 2008 – Mount Laso (Inside Military Lease Area) Coordinates: (Not Available) Habitat Type: Mixed Native Limestone Forest No mosquito specimens were collected from the EVS trap and BG-Sentinel trap, because no mosquitoes were caught in either trap. A decision was made to forgo setting subsequent mosquito traps at this location based on trap rate and time constraints. A malaise trap was set up in an open grassy area adjacent to tangantangan trees at this site.
August 8, 2008 – Old Japanese Communications Center (Inside Military Lease Area) Coordinates: (Not Available)

Habitat Type: Building A collapsible Diptera/Hymenoptera cone trap was set up at the Old Japanese Communications Center to trap wasps. Canned chicken was used as protein bait. Subsequent visits to check the traps would reveal foraging ants to be a constant problem here.
August 8, 2008 – Japanese Air Administration Building and Air Operations Building Coordinates: (Not Available) Habitat Type: Building Two collapsible Diptera/Hymenoptera cone traps were set up at the Japanese Air Administration Building and one cone trap was set up at the Japanese Air Operations Building to trap wasps. Canned chicken was used as protein bait. Wasps were very common around the Japanese Air Administration Building, but no wasps appeared to be interested in the protein bait. Subsequent visits to check the traps would reveal foraging ants to be a constant problem here.
August 9, 2008 - Maga Transect (Inside Military Lease Area) Coordinates: UTM 55 15.059444 145.621667 Habitat Type: Mixed Native Limestone Forest Three entomologists spent the better portion of this day surveying this site along and off the established transect. Movement was slow as we developed an understanding for progressing carefully within the wet understory of the forest and avoiding the dreadful and unexpected sting of the Polistes stigma wasps, whose nests found along even the cut transect trail. Insects were sampled at several points by sweeping vegetation and hand collection from vegetation, under stones, and within substrate. Ants of several species were collected with baited cards. Neither adult candidate butterflies nor host plant species were located.

August 9, 2008 - Lake Hagoi (Inside Military Lease Area) Coordinates: UTM 55 15.068083 145.625033 Habitat Type: Mixed Nonnative/Tangantangan Forest One entomologist revisited established traps at this site for approximately 2 hours. Trapped specimens were collected from the EVS trap and BG-Sentinel trap before noon. Before sunset (6:44 PM), an EVS light trap with a green LED as a light source and a BGSentinel trap with BG-Lure and Octenol lure were set up in the survey area. Before sunset, mosquitoes were self-collected off himself with an aspirator. Mosquito identification is pending authorization to utilize the taxonomic services of Bishop Museum.
August 10, 2008 - Carolinas Nature Trail (CNT) Area (Outside Military Lease Area) Coordinates: UTM 55 14.939233 145.633783 Habitat Type: Mixed Native Limestone Forest Based upon discussions with fellow biologists regarding known densities of both host plant species at this site, we (three entomologists) decided to visit this site to get a better feel for the distribution and appearances of the host plants’ various life stages, as well as to sample insects from the host plants. A very large cluster of Elatostema calcareum was located in this area, growing along the numerous limestone outcroppings and within large corridor-like crevices in the stone. Very few insects were located on the plants themselves, most notably spittlebugs (Family Aphrophoridae) and ants of several species. Insects were sampled from the host plants and surrounding vegetation by sweep-netting, hand collection, and with the use of baited cards. The E. calcareum in various stages including with fruiting bodies, appeared quite healthy with no obvious signs of herbivory by either ungulates or insects. Some leaves were collected and bagged and two days letter yielded 2 small weevils (Family Curculionidae). Neither species of butterfly was located in either the adult or larval stage, despite the inspection of 30+ plants. As it turned out, the cluster of E. calcareum in this area was the largest in density and size that we would locate during the week long survey of all sites.
Several individual Maytenus thompsonii plants were also located within this site, but we did not have the opportunity to inspect them very closely prior to a very heavy downpour which hastened our retreat.

August 10, 2008 - Tinian Shinto Shrine (Carolinas Heights) (Outside Military Lease Area) Coordinates: (Not Available) Habitat Type: Mixed Native Limestone Forest After a heavy rain shower mid-day, this mixed native limestone forest with some nonnative secondary forest components was surveyed by three entomologists for approximately two hours in the afternoon on this date. Neither adult candidate butterflies nor host plant species were located. The vegetation in this area was very dense and movement was slow due to lack of an established transect in this area. Ants of several species were very high in density within this locality as were termites of several species. One adult scorpion (Liocheles australasiae) and a colony of drywood termites were located within a rotten log. Several large mosquito larvae (identification pending), were collected in rain-filled portions of the old Shinto Shrine in this area.

Trapped specimens were collected from the EVS trap and BG-Sentinel trap before noon. Mosquito identification is pending authorization to utilize the taxonomic services of Bishop Museum.
August 11, 2008 - Makpo Wells (Tinian Pumphouse Area) (Outside Military Lease Area) Coordinates: (Not Available) Habitat Type: Nonnative marshland Three entomologists visited the marshy terrain immediately surrounding the Tinian pumphouse on the morning of this date. No standing water could be located despite
29

recent heavy rains the day prior. No odonates were located. Several species of ants and one nonnative wasp species, (Family Vespidae, Delta sp.) were collected.

August 11, 2008 - Laderan Chiget Cliffs Transect (CC)
(Inside Military Lease Area) Coordinates: UTM 55 15.060816 145.647866 Habitat Type: Mixed Native Limestone Forest Three entomologists spent approximately 6 hours was spent walking this entire transect beginning from where the ridge intersects the paved road to the west until it ends at the Chiget beach area. Several individual Maytenus thompsonii plants were located and recorded with our GPS equipment. Only a single stand of Elatostema calcareum was located near the beach end of the transect. This stand was closely inspected for candidate larvae and other insects, but none were located. All individual plants of both host species appeared healthy and free of any appearance of herbivory. Very few insects were collected within surrounding native vegetation along this transect during this date, due to the amount of time needed to traverse the area and also because of our intention to return and conduct more sampling (which unfortunately did not occur due to time constraints). No adults of either candidate butterfly species were observed during this date. The densities of Polistes stigma nests along this transect were very high, in some areas two or more nests occurred within just five feet of each other. The nest height location varied from 1.5 feet from the ground to over 30 feet high from the ground. The single largest nest in terms of number of individuals was observed in this area, with a total of 40+ wasps. One single, large adult female coconut crab was observed within this area. Several mosquitoes were aspirated off the surveying entomologists.

August 11, 2008 - Korean Memorial & Saint Lourdes Shrine Cave (San Jose Village)
(Outside Military Lease Area) Coordinates: (Not Available) Habitat Type: Mostly Nonnative Secondary Forest w/some Native Limestone Forest Components Two entomologists visited the Saint Lourdes Shrine Cave and adjacent forest, located on the western edge of the San Jose village in the evening of this date. Unfortunately, a decent downpour prevented much of the work we had intended in the forest and we spent about one hour collecting insects and blacklighting within the cave itself and at the mouth of the cave. No insects were attracted to the blacklight and no scorpions were located.

August 12, 2008 - Aguiguan Lower West Limestone Forest (Outside Military Lease Area) Coordinates: (Not Available) Habitat Type: Mixed Native Limestone Forest One entomologist spent approximately two hours surveying the northeastern lower tier of mixed limestone forest. Neither adult candidate butterflies nor host plant species were located in this area. Arthropod samples were taken by net-sweeping surrounding native vegetation, use of baited cards, and hand sampling vegetation, under rocks, and in substrate. Individual and small herds of goats were observed during this time. Vegetation along this entire transect showed very obvious signs of ungulate herbivory, presumably by goats. Polistes stigma nest density was noticeably lower in this area than that observed on Tinian.
August 12, 2008 – Aguiguan Cisterns Near Base Camp
(Outside Military Lease Area) Coordinates: UTM 55 14.851366 145.556800 Habitat Type: Aquatic/Semi-aquatic and Mixed Nonnative Forest Two entomologists surveyed the aquatic environment inside of World War II era cisterns constructed by the Japanese during their occupation of island from approximately 1936 to 1945. There are numerous Japanese-era sites on the island with cisterns that contain water, but due to time constraints, the entomologists where only able to survey cisterns located in the center of the island, near the base camp. This area, which had once been a Japanese plantation village, had approximately 28 cisterns of various sizes and shapes (circular or rectangular with variable dimensions) and in various states of decay. Many of the cisterns were full of water, and some were empty or collapsed. Six of the cisterns containing water were sampled using a D-frame aquatic net and a mosquito dipper. Cistern biota sampled consisted of dragonfly nymphs, veliid bugs or broad shouldered water striders, chironomid or midgefly larvae, mosquito larvae, pleid bugs or pygmy backswimmers, annelid worms, a tetragnathid spider, and an adult beetle of unknown identification.
Some terrestrial insects were also collected in areas immediately adjacent to the cisterns. Both subterranean and drywood termites were collected from woody debris on the ground. A beetle larvae and an adult passalid beetle were also collected from wood debris (separate pieces of wood). Large millipedes were common in this area and were seen crawling within the substrate. Six of these millipedes were collected and were tentatively identified as Trigoniulus lumbricinus. Additionally, adult dragonflies (red species) were commonly seen flying through the cistern area. One of these dragonflies was caught in the base camp area, and was later identified by the Bishop Museum as Trapezostigma transmarina.
Approximately 1 hour was also spent surveying the mostly nonnative vegetation immediately surrounding the base camp area. Arthropod samples were taken by netsweeping surrounding vegetation, use of baited cards, and hand sampling vegetation,
32

under rocks, and in substrate. One immature scorpion (Liocheles australasiae) was located in the vegetation near the base camp.

August 12, 2008 - Aguiguan Upper West Limestone Forest
(Outside Military Lease Area) Coordinates: UTM 55 14.854216 145.550683 Habitat Type: Mixed Native Limestone Forest Three entomologists spent approximately two and a half hours surveying the northeastern upper tier of mixed native limestone forest. No adult candidate butterflies or Elatostema calcareum host plants were observed, but several individual Maytenus thompsonii plants were located and inspected carefully. These were the only flowering individuals of this species that we located during the week long survey. Most individuals showed signs of herbivory by goats along the base of the plant or on lower stems. Very few insects other than ant species and a couple of beetle species were collected from these host plants. Note, one M. thompsonii that was located within this area showed signs of insect feeding (chewing) on a large majority of leaves (see photos), but this feeding was not indicative of lepidopteran chewing, more likely chewing by beetles. Other arthropod samples were taken by net-sweeping surrounding native vegetation, use of baited cards, and hand sampling vegetation, under rocks, and in substrate.

(Outside Military Lease Area) Coordinates: (Not Available) Habitat Type: Exposed Limestone Rock Two entomologists spent approximately 15 minutes surveying small pools of water in the lower limestone shelf near the boat landing site. Drangonfly nymphs and mosquito larvae were found in the pools. A quick taste test suggested that the water was perhaps partly saline. Unfortunately more time could not be spent at this site due to an impending emergency evacuation of an injured biologist.

August 13, 2008 - Japanese Defensive Caves Trail South (Laderan Lasu, Mt. Lasu) (Inside Military Lease Area) Coordinates: UTM 55 15.039333 145.636833 Habitat Type: Mixed Native Limestone Forest Three entomologist spent approximately six hours surveying the established southbound transect in this area. Several clusters of Elatostema calcareum host plants were located and recorded with our GPS unit. No plants contained phytophagous insects and none exhibited signs of any herbivory. A few scatter individual Maytenus thompsonii plants were also located and recorded with our GPS. None exhibited signs of any herbivory. Arthropod samples were taken by net-sweeping surrounding native vegetation, use of baited cards, and hand sampling vegetation, under rocks, and in substrate. Polistes stigma nests were very high in density along this transect. Several mosquitoes were aspirated off the surveying entomologists.

No Elatostema calcareum host plants were located; however, a few scatter individual Maytenus thompsonii plants were located and recorded with our GPS. None exhibited signs of any herbivory. Arthropod samples were taken by net-sweeping surrounding native vegetation, use of baited cards, and hand sampling vegetation, under rocks, and in substrate. Several of the deeper WWII Japanese defensive caves were examined closely with both a LED headlamp and separately with a blacklight with no scorpions or other arthropods observed. One cave did contain a mid-sized juvenile coconut crab. Polistes stigma nests were very high in density along this transect. Densities of both Hypolimnas bolina and Hypolimnas anomala (Family Nymphalidae) were quite high along the entire length of this transect.

August 15, 2008 - Maga Transect (Inside Military Lease Area) Coordinates: UTM 55 15.059444 145.621667 Habitat Type: Mixed Native Limestone Forest On the final day of field work, one entomologist resurveyed this site for approximately three hours for the purpose of confirming absence of host plant species as noted on the August 9, 2008 visit to this site. No host plants were located despite careful searching along both the upper cliff edge, below the cliffs, and within the forest below the transect itself. Visual searches for the adult candidate butterflies were unsuccessful and no arthropods were collected on this date.
August 15, 2008 - NKK Railroad Shrine Trailhead (Inside Military Lease Area) Coordinates: (Not Available) Habitat Type: Nonnative Secondary Forest With a small amount of remaining time on the final day of field work, this nonnative, secondary forest site was surveyed for approximately 2 hours by one entomologist. Interestingly, but perhaps not surprisingly, insect diversity was much higher than that observed within the mixed limestone forest sites surveyed. Several specimens were collected including many insect and spider species not observed within the mixed limestone forest sites. Within the two acre area surveyed at this site, Polistes stigma nests were infrequently encountered and appeared to be less dense than that observed within the mixed limestone forest sites.

August 15, 2008 – Lake Hagoi
(Inside Military Lease Area) Coordinates: UTM 55 15.068083 145.625033 Habitat Type: Aquatic/Semi-aquatic Marshland An entomologist returned to Lake Hagoi for approximately three hours with a kayak for better access to the open water portions of the lake. Passage through the vegetation was
36

again difficult, but once the reeds were reached, movement over the water and mud was much easier. Unfortunately the height of the reeds prevented a clear view of where the open water portions of the lake were located. Due to this navigational difficulty and time constraints, the large open water portions of the lake were not visited. Small pockets of open water within the reeds where sampled however. These areas were teeming with water boatmen and water striders. Samples were taken with a D-frame aquatic, but no new benthic and aquatic organisms were collected compared to what was caught on August 7th. Many dragonflies were seen flying over the reeds, mostly the large red species, but a smaller species was also common. Damselflies were also common, but again only one species was apparent. This was the same species that was seen on August 7th. A sweep net was used to collect some more of the damselflies and two tetragnathid spiders were also collected.

DISCUSSION
The primary objectives of this week long survey were to determine the presence or absence of candidate species, Vagrans egistina and Hypolimnas octocula. mariannensis, to survey for and locate the host plant species, to inspect and survey the host plant habitat for potential insect threats to either the candidate butterflies or the host plants, and finally, to gather some information regarding the presence or absence of particular arthropod groups on the islands of Tinian and Augean, including insects of socie-economic importance (i.e., mosquito vector species, ants, and termites) and others including aquatic fauna such as odonates. The major limitation of this survey effort was the short duration of our visit which did not allow us to gather as much detailed information or to cover as many areas as we would have preferred. Heavy downpours affected our ability to survey on some days, but were not a significant factor. Surprisingly, the insidious Polistes stigma wasp was a substantial deterrent to moving quickly in most forested areas we surveyed. Coupled with the tricky terrain, humidity and high temperatures, and dense vegetation, the extent of the area surveyed at each site was less than we had hoped and intended to accomplish.

37

Candidate Butterflies (Vagrans egistina and Hypolimnas octocula mariannensis) Neither adults nor larvae of either candidate butterfly species were observed during our survey efforts. All host plants (both Elatostema calcareum and Maytenus thompsonii) that we located appeared healthy and flush with new vegetation for the most part, and all plants were inspected to the best of our abilities. Neither host plant species at any of the sites we surveyed exhibited evidence of lepidopteran feeding. Conditions on both islands were fairly moist with several rain showers and a couple of downpours occurring during our week long survey effort, so it was likely not too dry for the butterflies to have been present. Many of the life stages including larvae, pupae, and adults of the several nymphalid butterflies known to be present on Tinian were frequently observed during our surveys of the limestone forest areas. The species most commonly and frequently observed were Hypolimnas anomala and H. bolina.
Both the number and the density of invertebrates collected on the two host plant species located on Tinian (only Maytenus thompsonii was located on the one day of surveying on Aguiguan), was surprisingly low. The most commonly collected insect on both host plant species were ants. Very few phytophagous insects were observed. The following groups of insects were collected on Elatostema calcareum in very low numbers: weevils (Family Curculionidae); tephritid flies (Family Tephritidae); spittle bugs (Family Aphrophoridae); mealybugs (Family Pseudococcidae); plant hoppers (Family Fulgoroidea); and one katydid (Family Tettigoniidae). No plants except one individual of M. thompsonii located on Aguiguan showed signs of insect herbivory (apparently by beetles). Only on the island on Aguiguan did we observe signs of ungulate herbivory, apparently goat browsing on M. thompsonii.
Polistes stigma and Other Wasps Polistes stigma is a eusocial species of wasp belonging to the Vespidae family. They are generalist predators which forage for protein to nourish the larvae that are developing and housed within their paper nests. While this species may forage on nearly any sort of meat including that from human garbage, there is high potential for them to prey upon any invertebrates including butterfly larvae within their foraging area. Unfortunately, captured prey items are masticated (chewed up) when they are brought to the nest prior to being fed to the larvae, so it is difficult to ascertain what is being collected by the wasp. During our surveys of the mixed limestone forest areas, nests of this wasp species were generally observed to be as frequent as 4 nests within a 30 square foot area, occasionally occurring within 5 feet of each other.
Based upon our observations and prior survey work on the other islands within the CNMI, including Guam, we believe that densities of Polistes stigma nests on both Tinian and Aguiguan are extremely high and perhaps a significant factor which could preclude the two candidate butterfly species from utilizing the available host plant habitat on both islands. We believe it would be worthwhile to design a study to determine which groups of insects are being preyed upon by this species and to determine an actual measurement of nest density within the mixed limestone forest areas of Tinian and Aguiguan. Certainly, this information would be highly recommended prior to any efforts to augment
38

populations of the two candidate butterflies that are discovered on these islands, or prior to any effort to translocate these species there as part of a larger recovery process. Additionally, it would be useful to understand and compare the density of P. stigma nests within habitat occupied by the candidate butterflies on Guam and elsewhere. Based upon our firsthand knowledge, nest density is certainly much lower within occupied areas on Guam.
Several other species of predatory wasps are known from Tinian. Of these, Delta spp. solitary wasps are the most likely possible predators of the candidate butterflies. Being solitary wasps, however, the impact of their predation is likely much lower than that of the eusocial Polistes stigma. We collected two specimens of this genus within areas outside the mixed native limestone forest sites.
Ants Numerous species of ants collected during our surveys are pending identification, but it should be noted that certain species occurred in high densities within the mixed limestone forest areas that we surveyed. Most species are common tramp ants found throughout the Pacific region and some of these species are likely capable of inducing predation pressure on the larvae of the candidate butterflies.
Mosquitoes The mosquitoes collected on Tinian for this survey are awaiting identification. Mosquitoes are vectors of human diseases and animal diseases and nuisance pests of humans. Mosquito transmission of bird disease on Tinian is not a concern of USFWS. However, the Navy and Marine Corps will be concerned about mosquito-borne human diseases on Tinian if Tinian will be utilized for Navy and Marine Corps training and berthing. Vector-borne disease transmission to humans relies on several factors: a competent disease vector, the presence of a pathogen, a host reservoir, and favorable environmental conditions. The 1985 Hawaiian Agronomics report listed two species of mosquitoes found on Tinian during their survey from November 1984 – November 1985: Aedes albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus. A. albopictus can serve as a vector of dengue fever. Culex quinquefasciatus is a vector of West Nile virus, various viral encephalitides, dog heartworm, and avian malaria. Past surveys have found other Aedes and Culex species including Culex tritaeniorhynchus-vector of Japanese encephalitis, Aedes aegypti-a vector of dengue fever and yellow fever, and Anopheles indefinitus a possible vector of malaria. If human activity in Tinian increases, the chance of accidental introduction of a mosquito-borne disease infected host and a competent mosquito vector also could increase. Implementation of appropriate quarantine measures would be a logical course of action as well as implementation of mosquito surveillance programs.
Termites In many parts of the world, termites are ranked among the most significant economic insect pests. The Mariana Islands are no exception. Termite species in the Mariana Islands are primarily recorded from collections on Guam and Saipan. Light (1946) listed the following three species from Guam collected in 1936: 1) Cryptotermes hermsi Kirby (a synonym of Cryptotermes domesticus (Haviland)) (Kalotermitidae), 2) Neotermes
39

connexus Snyder (Kalotermitidae), and 3) Prorhinotermes inopinatus Silvestri (Rhinotermitidae); and one more species collected from an unknown location in the Mariana Islands, Calotermes marianus Holmgrem (species name no longer used - maybe a synonym of Incisitermes marianus Holmgren). Later in the 1970’s Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki (Rhinotermitidae) was documented as established on Guam (Su and Scheffrahn 1998); however, it was subsequently found that this termite was actually Coptotermes gestroi (Wasmann) (Rhinotermitidae) (Su and Sheffrahn 1998), formerly known as Coptotermes vastor Light (Rhinotermitidae) (Yeap et al. 2007). In 1993 Su and Sheffrahn (1998) found three additional termite species on Guam: Cryptotermes dudleyi Bank (Kalotermitidae), a Microceretermes species (Termitidae), and a Nasutitermes species (Termitidae). A more recent paper describing the complex of termites in the Mariana Islands (Yudin 2002) mentions Schedorhinotermes (Rhinotermitidae) and Macrotermes (Termitidae) as present on Guam and Saipan.
Outside of Guam and Saipan the distribution of termite species in the Mariana Islands does not appear to be well documented. The Hawaiian Agronomics, Inc. (1995) report refers to termites as abundant on Tinian, and mentions both subterranean (Rhinotermitidae) and drywood (Kalotermitidae) termites; however, no further identifications are provided. Table III-2 of their report listed 3 different species as collected, but unidentified. The report from the Chiba expedition to the Northern Mariana Islands (Natural Museum and Institute, Chiba 1994) lists only two species of termites: 1) Cryptotermes domesticus Haviland (Agihan, Anatahan, Guguan, and Sarigan) and 2) Prorhinotermes inopinatus (Agrihan, Anatahan, and Sarigan).
Identifications are pending, but it appears that at least three different species of termites were collected during the current survey. A large forest drywood (Kalotermitidae – most likely Neotermes connexus) and a species of the subterranean genus Prorhinotermes (Rhinotermitidae - most likely Prorhinotermes inopinatus) were found on both Tinian and Aguiguan. A second subterranean species, Coptotermes gestroi was collected on Tinian only.Coptotermes gestroi is by far the most damaging economic pest of the three species collected. As a subterranean termite, it primarily lives in large colonies underground, but constructs mud tubes to forage above ground and connect to sources of wood or other cellulosic materials. Colonies of this termite can cause significant structural damage in relatively short periods of time; therefore any construction on Tinian should take into consideration building design and building materials that will minimize the risk of termite infestation.
Odonates
The odonate fauna of the Mariana Islands has been described as meager, with only two endemic species (Anax piraticus Kennedy and Agrionoptera insignis guamensis Leiftinck) among the14 recorded taxa (Polhemus 2000). However, 8 years ago a new species, Ischnura luta, was discovered on the island of Rota and determined to be the first endemic damselfly recorded for the Mariana Islands (Polhemus 2000). Due to the fact that the insect fauna on Tinian and Aguiguan has not been well studied, and considering
40

that both islands have some freshwater bodies, it was determined that this order of insects should receive some additional focus.
Adult Anisoptera, or dragonflies, were commonly seen flying in most open areas on Tinian. Specimens of adult dragonflies were collected at Lake Hagoi, at the Tinian Dynasty Hotel Fountain, and within the town of San Jose. Species of adult Anisoptera collected included Trapezostigma transmarina Brauer, Pantala flavescens (Fabricius), and Diplacodes bipunctata (Brauer). These species are all indigenous to the region, and considered common. Lieftinck (1962) states that due to their strong migratory tendencies, P. Flavescens and D. punctata are the dominant dragonflies of Micronesia. Trapezostigma transmarina is not as widely distributed - the Micronesian range of its distribution only includes Bonin, Southern Mariana, Palau, and Yap (Lieftinck 1962). The only aquatic area sampled on Tinian for immatures, or nymphs, was Lake Hagoi, and although many adults were seen flying above the lake, dragonfly nymphs were not found within the lake. There appeared to be at least one species present on Tinian that we saw, but were unable to catch, and which was different from the three species that were collected. This species was medium sized with bluish gray and maybe some yellow coloration, and was seen near the Japanese Village Ruins and also at the trailhead of the Japanese Defensive Caves Trails.
One adult dragonfly was collected on Aguiguan near Japanese-era cisterns that are partially filled with water. This specimen was identified as T. transmarina. Dragonfly nymphs were collected from these cisterns, and from small rock pools near the ocean at the boat landing site. There were a number of these pools in the limestone rock, filled presumably by rainwater or spray from crashing waves. These nymphs were semitranslucent and greenish in color. Mosquito larvae were also present in these pools in high numbers. Identification is pending for all dragonfly nymphs collected on Aguiguan.
Adults and nymphs of Zygoptera, or damselflies, were collected at Lake Hagoi. The adults were identified as Agriocnemis femina femina (Brauer), and the identifications of the nymphs are pending. This species appeared common within close proximity to Lake Hagoi, however adult damseflies were not seen anywhere else on the island. Agriocnemis femina femina is considered a widely spread, indigenous species (Lieftinck 1962) and is not of any particular conservation concern.
It appears that neither of the two endemic dragonfly species were collected on Tinian or Aguiguan during this survey, but until the nymphs collected on Aguiguan are identified this cannot be stated with certainty. These two species are found only in the southern Mariana Islands, Anax. piraticus having been found on Guam and Saipan, and Agrionoptera insignis guamensis having been found only on Guam.
Other Aquatic Insects
Aquatic insects collected on Tinian in Lake Hagoi are awaiting further identification; however, the taxa match fairly well with the aquatic organisms recorded in the Hawaiian Agronomics survey (Hawaiian Agronomics, Inc. 1995). The aquatic organisms collected
41

from cisterns on Aguiguan are interesting because there is apparently no record of any previous aquatic sampling within the island’s Japanese-era structures. Identifications are pending, but the following is a preliminary list of organisms collected from the cisterns: 1) Heteroptera: Veliidae, 2) Heteroptera: Pleidae, 3) Diptera: Chironomidae, 4) Odonata, 5) Coleoptera, and 6) Aranea: Tetragnathidae.
Of particular interest are the pleids, or pygmy backswimmers, that were collected. There was no record of the family Pleidae in Micronesia until 2007 when a paper was published describing the discovery in 2006 of Paraplea puella (Barber) on Guam in a river outflow (Zack et al. 2007). Paraplea puella is a North American species of pleid and is speculated to have been accidentally transported to Guam recently via the aquaculture or aquarium trade. How pleids would have arrived on Aguiguan is somewhat of a mystery since it is an uninhabited island. The cistern in which the pleids were found is a remant structure of a Japanese-era plantation village that existed from 1936 to 1945 (Butler 1990). It is possible that pleids were introduced to Aguiguan by the Japanese at this time. If the pleid specimens can be identified to the species level, the history of their presence on Aguiguan may become better understood.

2.2.2 CANDIDATE BUTTERFLY SURVEYS ON TINIAN
Prepared by: Nathaniel B. Hawley, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Saipan, MP and Antonio Castro, Division Fish and Wildlife, Tinian, MP
INTRODUCTION
A survey was conducted on the island of Tinian, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) from June to October, 2008 to determine the presence or absence of two butterfly species, Marianas rusty butterfly Vagrans egistina and the forest flicker Hypolimnas octocula mariannensis (Family Nymphalidae). Currently, V. egistina and H. octocula mariannensis are listed as candidates for listing under the Endangered Species Act. Both butterfly species are considered rare and were only recorded on the islands of Saipan, Rota and Guam (Schreiner and Nafus 1996). V. egistina was last collected on Guam in the late 1970s and on Rota in the1980s and 1995. H. octocula mariannensis is historically known from Guam and Saipan and after an intensive survey for this species in 1995, investigators found only 10 populations on the island of Guam and none on the island of Saipan (Schreiner and Nafus 1996).
Based on a literature review, very few entomological studies have been conducted on the island of Tinian. The most comprehensive report available was prepared for the United States Navy (Contract N62742-84-C-0141) by Hawaiian Agronomics (International), Inc. in December, 1985. Hawaiian Agronomics staff spent a total of seventeen days between November 1984 to November 1985 collecting insects (including Lepidoptera) utilizing various methods of collection that accounted for temporal differences. They did not collect Vagrans egistina or Hypolimnas octocula mariannensis. This result was not surprising as both species have not been recorded on the island of Tinian, CNMI, previously. However, Vagrans egistina or Hypolimnas octocula mariannensis may have historically been found on Tinian or were missed during past survey efforts. A key factor in potentially finding either butterfly species is the presence of host plants on Tinian.
The recorded host plant for V. egistina is Maytenus thompsonii (Family Celastraceae), a small tree/shrub endemic to the Marianas and found primarily in the understory of native limestone forests (Vogt and Williams 2004, Schreiner and Nafus 1996). The recorded host plants for the H. octocula mariannensis are Procris pedunculata and Elatostema calcareum, both forest herbs (Family Urticaceae) found growing on limestone outcrops in native limestone forest (Schreiner and Nafus 1996).
METHODS
The primary objective of this survey was to determine the presence or absence of both Candidate species Vagrans egistina and Hypolimnas octocula mariannensis by locating host plant sites for each species and monitoring sites for life cycle stages. Since a large group of biologists were involved in surveying the flora and fauna on the island of Tinian, CNMI from June to August, 2008 an information guide (Figure 1) was produced and distributed to each biologist. The guide provided photographs of both butterflies and
50

their host plants as well as descriptions of the caterpillars. The goal of the guide was to help identify host plants and V. egistina and H. octocula mariannensis in the field in order to collect GPS points of their locations for additional monitoring.
Four host plant sites were identified by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Department of Defense biologists from June to August, 2008. Two host plant sites were located on Department of Defense leased land at Japanese Cave (Figure 2), and Chiget Cliff (Figure 3) and two on CNMI Public Lands at Carolinas Nature Trail (Figure 4) and Sisonyan Makpo (Figure 5).
A host plant area is an area with host plants for either Vagrans egistina or Hypolimnas octocula mariannensis within a 25 meter perimeter. For the purpose of this survey, only visual search hours were recorded while the observer was in a host plant area. Each identified host plant site was visually scanned for life cycle stages (eggs, caterpillar, chrysalis, and imagoes/adults) by one or two observers for up to two weeks at various time of the day. As time permitted a further scan of the area was conducted of up 1500 meters to determine if additional host plant sites had gone undetected.
Due to time constraints, this survey was unable to account for seasonal variation. The bulk of the survey occurred during the months of September and October which are considered part of the rainy season. Therefore, limited sampling was done during the dry season. However, Schreiner and Nafus (pers. comm. 2008) observed both species to be more numerous on islands they are recorded from during the rainy season although adults were observed year round.
Two butterfly bait traps (lip type obtained from BioQuip.com) were set at each host plant site for up to two weeks. The butterfly bait traps were re-baited every three days with locally obtained mashed, rotting bananas, a liberal dose of raw cane sugar, and a dash of water. The bait was prepared on the afternoon prior to the morning of use and typically became well fermented prior to being placed in the field. The traps were positioned within 5 meters of a host plant cluster and at approximately 3-4 meters above the ground.
RESULTS
No individuals of either candidate butterfly species were observed. A total of four host plant areas were identified and monitored from 9/10/08 till 10/21/08. A description of the search effort at each site is outlined below.
Carolinas Nature Trail (CNT) Area Two sites, greater than 50 meters apart, were monitored at the Carolinas Nature Trail Area (UTM 55 P0353070 1652046). A total of 13 days were spent conducting visual searches (1,574minutes) with 624 hours spent trapping with 2 traps (Table 1). Common melon flies (Bactrocera sp.) were observed during thirteen of the fifteen times the traps were checked and were only recorded at one of the other monitoring areas, Chiget Cliff. However, no Vagrans egistina or Hypolimnas octocula mariannensis were recorded at
51

this site. This area is not in the Military Lease Area and supported the single largest cluster of Elatostema calcareum found during this survey.
Japanese Cave (JC) Mount Lasu Area The Japanese Cave Mount Lasu area (UTMs 55 P 0353408 1663125 and 55 P 0353357 1663105) is located in the Military Lease Area and consisted of several small clusters of host plants (Maytenus thompsonii and Elatostema calcareum). The two fruit baited traps were stationed at the two largest clusters (UTM site-1 = 55 P 0353408 1663125 and site2 = 55 P 0353357 1663105). At Japanese Cave site-2, two caterpillars and four chrysalises of the blue moon butterfly Hypolimnas bolina were found feeding/pupating on E. calcareum, the chrysalises were reared in the lab for confirmation. Additional smaller clusters were visited several times over the 15 monitoring period with 1765 visual search minutes recorded and the two traps produced 696 total traps hours (Table 1). Over 8 kilometers of cliff line in the Mount Lasu area were surveyed for additional host plant sites during this period. Several small pockets consisting of 1-5 E. calcareum individuals were identified and scanned for life cycle stages of the candidate species, but none were found. Three Melanitis leda (Family Satyridae) and one H. bolina (Family Nymphalidae) were found feeding in the traps at Japanese Cave site-2. In addition, large congregations of mating H. bolina and Hypolimnas anomala (guardian butterfly) were observed, which supports Kemp’s (2000) finding that the reproductive activity increases in H. bolina during months of higher rainfall and humidity levels.
Chiget Cliff (CC) -Laderan Chiget Area Only one stand of Elatostema calcareum was identified and monitored at the Chiget Cliff site (UTM 55 P 0354957 1665402) after an extensive search (4 km) of the area. The site had approximately 175 individual Elatostema calcareum stems that were scanned for life cycle stages. Approximately 960 minutes were spent monitoring this site during the 12 day period, with 408 total trap hours (Table 1). No Vagrans egistina or Hypolimnas octocula mariannensis were recorded at this site. However, three Gehyra oceanica (Oceanic Gecko) were observed in the traps feeding themselves on melon flies (Bactrocera sp.). This site is entirely in the Military Lease Area.
Sisonyan Makpo (SM) Area The Sisonyan Makpo site (UTM 55 P 0355868 1656618) was surveyed for 6 days with 505 visual search minutes and 120 total trap hours (Table 1). No Vagrans egistina or Hypolimnas octocula mariannensis were recorded at this site. This site is not in the Military Lease Area and was only surveyed as time permitted.
DISCUSSION
The primary objective of this survey was to determine the presence or absence of the two candidate species butterfly species, Vagrans egistina and Hypolimnas octocula. mariannensis After 4806 minutes (approx. 80 hours) of visual searching and 1848 documented trap hours (approx. 77 days) during the months of September and October, 2008 no life cycle stage of either species was collected. This finding was not entirely surprising as neither V. egistina or H. octocula mariannensis were previously collected or
52

observed on Tinian despite the fairly comprehensive surveys conducted by Hawaiian Agronomics Inc. from 1984-85.
The bulk of the survey was represented by only two months of the rainy season, September and October, 2008. Several biologists however were actively investigating areas for host plant sites and individuals for at least 2 months prior to the survey, July and August, 2008. Even though the survey did not account for seasonal variation, it can be concluded that some life cycle stage of either species (Vagrans egistina and Hypolimnas octocula mariannensis) should have been collected after this level of effort. However it is recommended that host plants site should be observed monthly for at least one year to be certain.
Tinian is not known to be part of either species’ historical range. However, the likelihood of introduced pests arriving to Tinian due to an increase in sea and air transports is a concern for a suite of native butterfly species. Additionally, any reduction of host plant sites for Vagrans egistina and Hypolimnas octocula mariannensis should be a conservation concern if translocation is considered as part of any future recovery or enhancement plans.

2.2.3 COCONUT CRAB SURVEYS ON MILITARY LEASE LANDS ON TINIAN
Coconut Crab. Photo by Scott Vogt.
Prepared by: Scott Vogt, Wildlife Biologist, U.S. Navy, NAVFAC Pacific, Honolulu, HI
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Coconut crabs (Birgus latro) were sampled on military lease lands on the island of Tinian and also on the uninhabited island of Aguijan just south of Tinian. Crabs were sampled by bait station transect lines and on 2 mark recapture bait station grids. Transect lines sampled 4 different habitat types (tangantangan forest, native forest, coastal forest , and grassland) and the trapping grids sampled 2 habitat types (tangantangan forest and native forest). Crab demographics and population densities were documented. The data show that on Tinian and Aguiguan, coconut crabs are being over-harvested and that present harvest rates cannot be sustained. Compared with unharvested populations, the Tinian and Aguiguan crab sizes are much smaller and densities are much lower. INTRODUCTION The Coconut or Robber Crab (Birgus latro) has a wide distribution ranging from Eastern Africa, through the Indian Ocean islands to the Pacific Ocean islands. Due to its large size, ease of collection and palatable flesh, the coconut crab is often over-harvested when it occurs in the vicinity of human habitation. The Mariana islands are no exception and surveys on Guam (USFWS, 2001) and Saipan (Kessler, 2006) have documented overharvested populations.
61

Tinian is the second largest island in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) with an area of 102 sq. km (39 sq. miles), and a human population of 3,500. Most habitat on Tinian is degraded due to a history of the grazing impacts of feral and domestic cattle, extensive sugar cane cultivation and disturbance during WWII. Vegetation is currently dominated by non-native species, principally the tangantangan tree (Leucaena leucocephala), Native limestone forest is generally confined to the sides of cliffs or other areas that were not suitable for cultivation. The northern 2/3rds of Tinian is leased by the U.S. Navy for training, although there are presently no military buildings there. A radio relay station for the Voice of America is on Tinian military lands and covers about 20 hectares.
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands has a legal crab hunting season from September 15-November 15. Only crabs with a thoracic width larger than 3 inches (76 mm) are allowed to be taken and females carrying eggs (berried) of any size are prohibited. Coconut crabs are a type of hermit crab, however they drop the habit of residing in a shell at a small size and go through life with no shell. They are the largest land dwelling invertebrate in the world and can reach a weight in excess of 5kg. Coconut crabs breed on land but the female releases the eggs in the ocean where they immediately hatch. The oceanic larval stage lasts 2-3 weeks (Fletcher and Amos, 1994). Once on land the growth rate is slow and it probably takes 8-10 years for crabs to reach the CNMI legal size limit (Brown and Fielder, 1991).
The goals of this study were to establish coconut crab population densities and demographics on Tinian, and calibrate the catch per unit of effort index of bait station transect lines. With a calibrated index, crab densities can be calculated from the catch rates on transect lines of bait stations.
STUDY AREA
This study sampled coconut crabs on Navy leased lands on Tinian. The northern 2/3 of the island is leased by the U.S. Navy for training activities.
There are four main habitat types in this area: native limestone forest, introduced tangantangan (Leuceana leucocephala) forest, grassland, beach strand and mixed tangantangan grassland.
Crabs were sampled in February, April and May of 2007.
In October, 2006 a sampling trip was made to Aguiguan, an uninhabited island several miles south of Tinian. It was hoped that this island would provide a less harvested control population to compare with Tinian.

METHODS Bait station transects Coconut crab abundances were initially measured by transect lines of fermented coconut bait stations. The fermented coconut is a local technique (called "Poni"), coconut meat is grated, and allowed to ferment in a closed container for 5~10 days. One handful of poni bait was set on the ground (1 station) to attract crabs. Transect lines of poni bait stations, spaced every 20 meters, were used to sample native forest, introduced tangantangan, mixed tangantangan forest, grassland and beach strand habitat types. A total of 12 transect lines were monitored (Figure 1.). Four in native forest, 5 in tangantangan and mixed forest, 2 in grassland and 1 in beach strand. Each transect had 20-30 stations and was monitored for 1 or 2 nights. On Aguiguan 55 stations (20 meter spacing) on two lines were set in native forest for 3 nights and one line of 18 stations (20 meter spacing) was set in tangantangan mixed forest for 1 night. Crab abundance was expressed as the catch per unit of effort (CPUE). CPUE was calculated by the number of crabs captured divided by the number of trapping nights. The number of trapping nights was the number of bait stations multiplied by the number of nights they were monitored. For example, 25 stations monitored for 2 nights was 50 trapping nights. Ten crabs captured on a 25 station transect monitored for 2 nights would be a CPUE of 0.20. Crabs captured between bait stations were also used in the CPUE calculation.
Figure 1. Location of bait station transect lines.
63

Mark recapture grids Bait station grids were used to establish coconut crabs densities. Two grids of 100 coconut bait stations were set up in native forest and tangantangan forest (Figure 2.). Bait stations were spaced every 20 meters and the grids were 10 stations by 10 stations (100 stations total, 180 meters by 180 meters) and covered an area of 3.24 hectares. The locations of the grids were selected based on the CPUE of the bait station transects. The native forest grid was set on the cliff line facing North Field and approximately 1500 meters northwest of Mt Lassa. The tangantangan grid was placed in one of the forest blocks immediately off of the southwest end of runway able.
Figure 2. Location of mark-recapture grids. Each bait station consisted of a whole coconut that had fallen off the tree but still had juice and had not yet sprouted. A small hole (~3 cm diameter) was cut into the coconut exposing the meat and juice. The coconut was wired to a tree or stuck onto a cut sapling tree so that the coconut was 10-30 cm off the ground. Vanilla extract was then poured into the coconut to magnify the scent. The crabs will stay on the coconut feeding and can be easily captured at night. Crabs on the ground at, and between, bait stations were also collected, marked and measured. The grids were monitored for 5 nights within a one week period. Crabs captured on the grid were measured for thoracic length, weighed, sexed, marked and released. Crabs were marked with, fingernail polish, permanent magic marker or clear epoxy glue over a paper number. Mark recapture data was analyzed using Program MARK to estimate the size of the population. This population estimate was then used with the effective area sampled (see below) to calculate the crab density for each habitat sampled. MARK also estimates the
64

capture probability and recapture probability.
Telemetry and Thread Bobbins A difficulty in trying to establish animal densities using trapping grids is determining how many animals come from outside the grid to be captured. So, the grid samples a larger area than its dimensions. It is often difficult to calculate the size of the sampled area and this is vital for accurate density estimates. A way to solve this problem is to fit animals with transmitters so that movements within and outside the grid can be ascertained. In this way a buffer strip can then be added to the grid boundary for density calculations. In other words, from telemetry data an extra 50 meters might be added to the grid boundary so that the true area sampled was 280m x 280m and not 180m x 180m. This problem is often overlooked or taken lightly in grid sampling but, small changes can have very large effects on the final density estimate.
Wildlife Track transmitters were attached to crabs with non-toxic marine putty. The transmitters weighed 10 grams and the putty added an additional 10 grams for 20 grams total. Crabs that were smaller than 150 grams were not fitted with transmitters. The transmitters have a 12 month battery life.
Crabs captured within the grids were weighed, measured for thoracic length and width, sexed and those larger than 150 grams were fitted with transmitters. Crabs were then released at the point of capture.
Barber thread bobbins were also attached (with non-toxic marine putty) to 8 crabs captured on the bait station transect lines. After attaching the bobbin crab was released. The thread feeds out and can be followed.
Comparison with a non-harvested population Coconut crab fieldwork was conducted on the island of Diego Garcia at the Mini Mini conservation area in July 2003 and March 2004. Because of tight security and access restrictions this area contains a true non-harvested coconut crab population. Population density and demographics were documented for this area and are used here as a control population for comparison.
RESULTS
Transect lines Transect lines in native forest had the highest CPUE with an average of 0.11 (range, 0.070.13). Tangantangan had a mean CPUE of 0.03 (range, 0-0.06). No crabs were captured in the grassland or beach strand habitats. The catch rates in tangantangan and native forest were very consistent.
Two bait station lines on Aguiguan produced a CPUE of 0.20. A bait station transect (20 stations, 20 meters spacing, monitored for 2 nights) on Diego Garcia in a mixed coconut/native forest produced a CPUE of 1.78.
65

Mark recapture grids
The native forest grid captured 34 crabs and the tangantangan grid captured 12 animals. This was consistent with the line transect data for these habitat types in that the native forest grid captured ~3 times as many crabs as the tangentangen grid.. There were no recaptures on either grid. The majority of the crabs were captured within the first 3 days: 82% on the native forest grid and 75% on the tangantangan grid. Since there were no recaptures, the data were analyzed as removal plots. Due to the short sampling period, the population was assumed to be closed (no deaths, births, immigration or emigration). Because of the behavioral response to being captured the model "Full Closed Captures with Heterogeneity" in program MARK was chosen for the analyses. This model takes into account the behavioral response to being captured and also individual heterogeneity in capture (different individuals have different capture probabilities). See Table 1 for the population estimates and capture probability estimates for the 2 mark recapture grids.

Telemetry and Thread Bobbins
Not as much data was collected as desired due to problems with the radio receivers. Both units initially worked for 1-2 days and then stopped picking up the signals. Another receiver was borrowed from COMNAVMAR but several days of data were missed because of this. All crabs left the grid area, or lost/destroyed the transmitter, 1-14 days after having the transmitter attached.

An apparent behavioral response was shown by all crabs with transmitters. All crabs took shelter in rock crevices and stayed there for 1-5 nights before resuming foraging. Eight crabs on the native forest grid were fitted with transmitters and 6 on the tangantangan grid. Twenty eight out forty six (60%) of the crabs, captured on the grids were too small for transmitters (less than 150 grams).

Two transmitters were found in the field having apparently fallen off the crab. One, in the native forest grid, was within 2 meters the capture point. The other was off of the tangantangan grid and was found 210 meters from the point of capture just outside of the forest on the runway tarmac.

The thread bobbins did not provide as much data as hoped due to the thread breaking within 40 meters of the release point. All crabs released with bobbins climbed trees within 15 meters of capture. The thread broke on 6 of the crabs within 15 meters after climbing down from the tree. One crab after climbing down the tree took refuge in a karst crevice where the thread broke. One crab stayed in a crevice 2 days and nights before moving out and then the thread broke.

Population densities
While not as much telemetry data was collected as hoped, enough was collected to estimate the actual size of the area trapped. The mean of the maximum distance moved (MMDM) by each crab, within the one week grid sampling period, was added as a buffer to the dimensions of the trapping grids. The data from both grids were pooled for this due to the low sample size. This was 50 meters. So the effective trapping area was 280 meters x 280 meters or 7.84 hectares for both grids. See Table 2 for the density estimates for each habitat type.

A similar crab mark recapture project with a bait station grid on Guam had an MMDM buffer strip of 44 meters (USFWS 2001). This MMDM was calculated by recaptured crabs on the grid (the distance between recaptures) and not telemetry but the similarity is noteworthy.

The density estimate for the Diego Garcia population, using quadrat sampling, was 233 crab/ha, 107-358. This is roughly 42 times higher than Tinian.

Using the area of each habitat type (Liu and Fisher 2006) we can estimate the total crab population for Navy lands on Tinian. Native forest (150ha) = 742 crabs; secondary growth forest (2021 ha) and tangantangan forest (2302 ha) = 7,911 crabs. Total population estimate for these forest communities is 6,653 crabs. Of this estimate, 421 crabs (6.33%) are legal size. Note, that since the catch rates of the bait station transect lines were similar for tangantangan and secondary forest, the densities are presumed to be similar.

Our study, to a degree, has calibrated the catch rate index (Charts 3, 4, and 5). A higher catch rate on the transect lines did in fact predict a higher density of crabs. Using the Aguiguan catch rate of 0.20 we can reasonably conclude that the density is at least double that of Tinian native forest which had an average catch rate of 0.11. So, we can reasonably conclude that Aguiguan has crab densities of about 10 crabs/ha. The area of Aguiguan is 699 ha and of this, 479 ha (68%) is forested (Chapter 2. this report). For the forested area, we estimate the Aguiguan population to be 4,790 crabs. We did not survey the non-forested areas (mostly dominated by introduced Lantana camara). So crab numbers on Aguiguan are undoubtedly higher than this estimate.

Population Demographics
Counting captures from the transect lines, the grids and road captures, a total of 79 crabs on Tinian, were measured and weighed in this study. Out 79 crabs, 5 were legal size (6.33%). Of the 79 crabs, 41 were female and 38 were male.

67

Comparing the mean sizes and weights with the Diego Garcia (non-harvested) population is interesting (Table 3). The differences are stark (Charts 1. and 2.). The graphs show that the reason the average weights at Diego Garcia are roughly 4 times higher than Tinian is due to an almost total lack of crabs above the legal size limit (~37 mm TL) on Tinian.

On Diego Garcia the most common size class, 41-50mm, represents about 35% of the population. On Tinian this size class is only 3% of the sample, and there were no crabs found that were larger than this size class. On Diego Garcia crabs larger than the 4150mm size class represent an additional 31% of the population.
This is further graphically shown in chart 3, comparing Guam, Saipan, Tinian and Aguiguan data with the Diego Garcia non-harvested standard. On these Marianas islands there is nothing above 50 mm TL and very few that are above 40 mm TL, while on Diego Garcia the majority of the population is above 40mm TL.
The data from Aguiguan is hampered by small sample size due to the short time spent on the island. While the catch rate was almost double that of Tinian the demographics were similar to Tinian (Guam and Saipan also) and indicate that Aguiguan is also overharvested (Chart 3, Appendix 2.). The proportion of the Aguiguan sample over the legal size limit, 12% (4 out of 25) was also double what it was on Tinian. This produces an estimate of 574 legal size crabs on the forested areas of Aguiguan.

We documented only 1 crab smaller than 20mm TL on Tinian. Crabs smaller than 20rnm TL are typically not well documented with surveys like these (Chauvet, C. and T. KadiriJan.1999). The habits of these smaller crabs make them harder to find and they are typically nearer to the ocean (Kadiri-Jan and Chauvet 1998). So we cannot comment on juvenile recruitment with this study even though this is obviously an important factor.

69

Calibration of the CPUE index
The CPUE index was strongly correlated with the number of crabs captured on the grid and the estimated densities (Charts 4, 5, and 6). The previously mentioned Guam study produced a CPUE of 0.15, captured 45 crabs and produced a density estimate of 14 crab/ha.
The Guam, and Tinian data fit well together with a very strong correlation between the CPUE, the total number of crabs captured (Chart 4.) and the estimated crab densities (Chart 5.).

When the Diego Garcia data is added, the correlation is very strong (Chart 6.). The relationship on the regression graph appears linear however there is a very large data gap
70

between the Marianas and Diego Garcia. The relationship might not be linear as the CPUE for Diego Garcia was 15 times higher than the CPUE for native forest on Tinian but, the true density was in fact 46 times higher. We suspect that there is a leveling off or saturation point with the bait stations, in that one can only get so many crabs on one station. So, the relationship is probably sigmoid and not linear.

DISCUSSION

This study has shown that the demographics of coconut crabs on Tinian favor much smaller crabs than a non-harvested population (Diego Garcia) There are few crabs over the legal size limit and population densities are much lower than the non-harvested population. Over-harvest is the suspected reason for this.

Crab surveys on Aguiguan in 2000 (Cruz et al. 2000) pointed to an over harvested population. The average width and weight (thoracic length was not measured) was 66 mm and 293 grams. In 2006 the average width and weight was slightly smaller at 61 mm and 245 grams. The catch rate in 2000, however, was much higher with 3.7 crabs/bait station for 1 night of trapping.
When compared with a non-harvested population, the differences are stark. At all sampling sites old bait stations from crab hunters were seen. Anecdotally, out of season poaching is reported to be rampant. There are also reports of crabs being sold (this is illegal) for $50-$100 per crab (depending on the size) (C. Sanchez pers. com.). The CNMI economy is very poor at present and it is possible that crabs are being sold to supplement household income.
The telemetry data shows 2 predominant movement patterns by the crabs. Crabs occupy a small area for a short period of time or constantly move in random directions and distances. The movement patterns increase the likelihood of over-harvest as one does not need to move trap lines after an area has been trapped out. Crabs will quickly move

71

back into the area. Kessler (2006) documented similar movements on Saipan, where a 3.25 hectare grid was trapped out in one week and 2 months later a similar number of crabs were caught on the same grid. This pattern is likely to contribute to the belief that crabs are very abundant on Tinian. Most people when informed we were doing a crab study commented on the abundance of crabs on Tinian. Many people also talked about how 15-20 years ago one could drive the North Field roads and runways at night and collect many crabs on the road.
Both grid trapping sites had similar capture probabilities (0.28 and 0.33). On both habitat types ~ 30% of the population can be captured on a given night. This is a high capture probability that also makes the crabs susceptible to over-harvest.
Given the movement patterns of the crabs and that North Field on Tinian has a fairly extensive road system, slowly cruising the roads at night would be a low effort method to harvest coconut crabs. Three crabs were captured on roads during this study, on the way home after checking bait stations on the grids or the transect lines. Fresh bait stations were also observed placed just off the road, 2-3 meters in the forest, leading to the Mt Lasso over look. This would also provide a quick and easy method for crab harvest.
Size data and telemetry suggest that small crabs are being harvested. The transmitter found on the tarmac of North Field appeared to have been purposefully removed by a poacher, as it was 210 meters from the release site out on the tarmac with no cover or vegetation The other transmitter that fell off did so within 2 meters of the capture site, suggesting that the putty had not dried sufficiently before the crab was released. This crab was far below legal size at 28 mm TL, 58 mm width and 154 grams weight.
Sustainable crab harvest should not exceed the natural, annual, mortality of the legal sized population (Fletcher and Amos, 1994). This was estimated to be 5% of the population. With the Tinian population estimate for Navy lands this calculates to 21 crabs that can be harvested this year and 20 crabs for Aguiguan.
Given the evidence for large scale harvesting, poaching, and the skewed demographics it is obvious that the Tinian (and quite possibly Aguiguan) population is being harvested at an unsustainable rate.
MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
The obvious recommendation is to stop out of season poaching with increased law Enforcement, strictly enforce size and bag limits during the crab season and keep records of this sizes of harvested crabs. In light of the current economic situation on Tinian and the dollar value for a single crab, this could prove very difficult.
The best way to help the crab population recover would be a 5 year harvest moratorium, with population monitoring. After the 5 year period is up, allow a well regulated and controlled harvest. The population would be estimated as was done in this study and then a harvest goal would be set. Once this goal is reached, then the season would be closed.
72

The 5 year time period is somewhat arbitrary but enforcing a longer period of time is probably not feasible.
Because the coconut crab is such a popular game species a total crab moratorium might not be feasible. A more realistic approach might be to close select zones to crabbing for 5 years while allowing crab harvest elsewhere. At the end of 5 years the closed zone is opened and other areas are closed.
More information is needed on small sized crabs (< 20mm TL). A specific study on this size class is recommended to quantify juvenile densities, juvenile recruitment and establish distribution patterns.
We also recommend doing more work on calibrating the CPUE index with the true population density. The data gap between the lower and higher densities needs to be filled. As a management tool, being able to quickly estimate population densities from 2 or 3 night bait station transects would be invaluable.

INTRODUCTION
This work covers the terrestrial (as opposed to marine) reptiles and amphibians of Tinian. For marine turtles see US Fish and Wildlife Service (1996), Pultz et al. (1999), and Kolinski et al. (2004). This report describes all herpetofauna within the land environment, including subterranean (= fossorial), terrestrial, and arboreal species.
The data reported herein were generated primarily during field work supported by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service using funding from the U.S. Navy. Why might the Navy care about the status of reptiles on Tinian? Presumably the Navy is interested in conserving the diversity of life on lands that they manage by preserving required habitats, or minimizing detrimental habitat change. Accordingly, the 2008 fieldwork was conducted exclusively on Navy-leased lands of Tinian and the geographic scope of this report is Tinian’s Military Lease Area. In addition, military operations of all services may impact Tinian’s biodiversity and quality of life by accidentally introducing new species to Tinian. Thus a focus of this study is the interaction between native and introduced species. Finally, the health and resilience of ecosystems is often reflected in the composition of the ecological communities found in a place, and the Navy may wish to conserve that health and resilience both for the direct benefits to residents of the Northern Mariana Islands and for the greater latitude it provides for addressing ecological problems created elsewhere. For example, Tinian might become a refuge for bird or lizard species extirpated on Guam, thereby minimizing operational restrictions that might otherwise impact military activities on Guam. Alternately, if the Brown Treesnake or another invasive species were to become established on Tinian, military use of Tinian would be negatively impacted because shipments leaving Tinian for pest-free areas would present a biosecurity risk to destination sites; this would necessitate inspection and
79

interdiction efforts for military cargo, with associated costs in time and money. Thus the Navy can prevent future expenses by maintaining a healthy natural community on Tinian. Toward that end, we provide a snapshot of the terrestrial reptiles of Tinian in 2008, and compile historical records indicating change over time.
In this report we assume that the conservation of native species is warranted, but the protection of introduced species is not. Why do native reptiles deserve precedence over introduced species? The easiest example is the ecological disaster associated with the introduction of the Brown Treesnake on Guam (Savidge 1987; Fritts and Rodda 1998). In that case, the introduction of a single new reptile eliminated many of the native birds, bats, and lizards of Guam (Rodda et al. 1999). The net result was a spectacular loss of global biodiversity, but despite this, Guam now has more reptile and amphibian species than it did prior to the arrival of the Brown Treesnake. The additions to Guam were common widespread species, whereas the lost species were unique local ones. From Guam’s perspective, local biodiversity increased. The snake’s arrival spread a common species over an additional island, but eventually removed unique local bird and bat species from the entire world – global biodiversity decreased. As the bottom line is global biodiversity, species introductions are normally detrimental and should be avoided.
At 10,180 hectares, Tinian is the sixth largest of the ~2500 islands of Micronesia. Despite its relatively large size, Tinian has experienced only two herpetological inventories. The first islandwide compendium was published in 1948 (Downs 1948), though the entomologist Townes (1946) gave earlier useful notes. Downs collected 35 specimens, but missed one common species (Mourning Gecko, Lepidodactylus lugubris) and at least five rarer ones. Owen (1974) provided much useful information, but did not attempt a comprehensive inventory. Forty years later Wiles et al. (1989) produced the first comprehensive review, including not only original field work but also a review of all earlier literature records. Rodda et al. (1991) put the Tinian inventory of Wiles et al. (1989) into the context of the entire Mariana archipelago. The methods of Wiles et al. (1989) however did not lend themselves to quantification of the population densities of any species; their surveys provided only qualitative descriptions of relative density. Thus Wiles et al. (1989) provided a baseline inventory, but did not attempt the task of monitoring populations. This study provides the first quantification of population densities, including field data from 1989 and 2008.
Pregill (1998) made a major contribution to our understanding of the nativeness of various species by sampling subfossil cave remains on several Mariana Islands including Tinian. He found that only the Brahminy Blindsnake, Ramphotyphlops braminus was unequivocally native (occurred in prehuman layers), though the prehuman sediment sample was very small. On biogeographic grounds, and species’ occurrence in the earliest prehistoric strata, it is likely that several other species arrived in the Marianas unaided by humans, as detailed in the species accounts. An unexpected result of Pregill’s study was the discovery that several species previously thought to have been in the Marianas since antiquity arrived on Tinian only following the time of Western contact
80

(Oceanic Gecko, Gehyra oceanic; Mutilating Gecko, Gehyra mutilata; Mangrove Monitor, Varanus indicus) and were undoubtedly human introductions on Tinian.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Two methods were used islandwide in 1989: glueboard surveys and visual searches. Three methods were used in 2008, exclusively in the Military Lease Area: glueboard surveys, visual searches at night, and total removal plots. All study sites are mapped in Figure 1. Habitat names follow Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg (1998), with the exception of the “mixed” category, which is intermediate in composition and structure between Leucaena forest and limestone forest.

Glueboard sampling. - Glueboard sampling methods are detailed in Rodda et al. (1993, 2005b). The glueboards used in the 1989 sampling on Tinian were of several manufacturers, and were subsequently determined to be suboptimal for density studies. Therefore, the 1989 samples (Table 1) are not directly comparable to the 2008 samples (Table 2), which were conducted with paper mouse glueboards (Victor, Lititz PA). These traps were set individually in lines of 12 on the ground in shade. The traps were separated by at least 5 meters and aligned in either a straight line parallel to a road, shoreline, or trail edge, or in a ring surrounding a total removal plot. The traps were checked every 30 min for three morning hours (2008) or periodically throughout the day for 24 h (1989 and 2008). Capture rates are expressed as captures per trap-hour.

Visual search method. - Visual search methods are detailed in Rodda et al. (2005a). Briefly, the searchers worked individually, walking at about 0.5 km/h, scanning the vegetation on one side of a trail or road, usually at night with the aid of a headlamp. Each reptile seen was identified to species and characterized by its perch height and perch taxon, though the latter data will not be reported here. Relative densities are expressed as captures per unit effort (detections per searcher-hour); sample sizes are given separately for 1989 (Table 3) and 2008 (Table 4). The headlamps used in 1989 were relatively dim narrow-beam dry cell lights (Justrite, Des Plaines IL). Those used in 2008 were the brighter and broader beam Brunton (Riverton WY) and Mila (Sweden) lamps used by orienteering teams (similar to Mila lamps whose effectiveness is reported in Lardner et al. 2007, under review).

Total removal methods. - Total removal methods are described in detail in Rodda et al. (2001). In brief, our objective was to physically isolate a 10 × 10 m patch of forest such that no lizards (other than very large Varanus indicus) could leave or enter. Arboreal lizard movement was blocked by canopy separation, and terrestrial movement was prevented by erection of a 0.4 m-tall fence of aluminum flashing which was buried in the ground to block shallow subterranean escape, and sprayed with white lithium automotive grease to discourage climbing. The vegetation was then cut down, carefully inspected, and removed in small quantities to discover all non-fossorial non-volant vertebrates present.
To prevent arboreal lizards from fleeing during canopy separation, canopy separation was conducted during the day, when almost all of Tinian’s arboreal species are in refugia. To prevent terrestrial lizards from fleeing during erection of the aluminum flashing, fence emplacement occurred at night when the terrestrial species (almost all are diurnal) were in refugia. Three species of lizard and one toad could potentially escape because their activity periods are anomalous in this regard: Cane Toads (Rhinella marina) and Pacific Slender-toed Gecko (Nactus pelagicus) lizards were potentially capable of escaping on the ground because they are terrestrially-active at night while the fence was being erected; Green Anoles (Anolis carolinensis) and Emerald Skinks (Lamprolepis smaragdina) are likewise theoretically capable of escaping because they are active in the trees during the day (for example, they might flee the area during canopy separation). We do not believe that these species avoided detection on a large scale by these measures, but we were not able to rigorously quantify any leakage that might have occurred.
The locations of the total removal plots on Tinian (Table 5) were selected by the Navy representative Scott Vogt, in order to best accommodate the technical challenges of erecting a lizard-proof fence while surrounding an area of characteristic vegetation. Thus the exact plot localities were chosen to maximize vegetation representativeness and soil depth (Table 6). They were not chosen with any knowledge of the constituent reptile densities and therefore should be unbiased reptile density samples.

Table 5. Characteristics of total removal sampling plots used on military lease land on Tinian, 2008. The date range is for vegetation modification stages only. The listed “Person-Hrs” is the effort needed to remove and inspect the vegetation. Roughly an equal amount of time was required for other tasks.

We can more precisely understand the relationship between species density and habitat features using the vegetation measurements of each plot (summarized in Table 6). In general, the basal area of Leucaena and the count of all woody stems (> 1 cm dbh) decreased in the sequence Leucaena-mixed-limestone forest and the number of large stems (>10 cm dbh) and the total vegetative biomass increased in the same habitat order. The dominant ground cover was about 60% leaf litter in all cases, but the amount of coarse woody debris tended to increase in the Leucaena-mixed-limestone forest sequence.

Table 6. Vegetative characteristics of the total removal plots. Reported woody percentages are of basal area for the entire plot (all woody stems > 10 mm diameter breast high (dbh)). Reported groundcover percentages are mean ground coverage. The secondary groundcover “CWD” is coarse woody debris.

Detection probability estimation and missed ratios. - We paired glueboard sampling with total removal plots to assess the trap detection probabilities of various species. The glueboards were placed as close to the plot as is possible while assuring a 7
86

m separation between traps (to minimize intertrap interference). On Tinian we always conducted the paired glueboard trapping prior to disturbance of the plot vegetation.
Similarly, we paired visual surveys with total removal sampling whenever the geography of surrounding vegetation made practical visual surveys in the same habitat sampled by total removal. This too allowed an estimate of detection probability from the absolute densities documented in the total removal plots. Detection probability is of interest primarily because it can be used to estimate the proportion of animals that are overlooked in a survey. For example, if the detection probability is 0.25, one out of four animals were detected, on average. Another way to state this is that four animals were usually present for every one that was seen (in other words, we missed three of four). This is the way we state it in this paper, a value we will call the “missed ratio,” the inverse of detection probability. In our example the missed ratio of 4.0 indicates that if we saw 8, 32 were most likely present.
When the “missed ratio” is multiplied by the mean detection rate for a habitat-byspecies combination (e.g., the Indo-Pacific House Gecko, Hemidactylus frenatus, in mixed forest) we obtain an estimate of absolute density for the habitat sampled. This allows a key check on whether the absolute densities reported from total removal plots were representative of the habitat. For example, using missed ratios we estimated that the Mourning Gecko, Lepidodactylus lugubris, was generally more common in Leucaena habitat than they were in our Leucaena total removal plots, but that our total removal samples of the Mutilating Gecko, Gehyra mutilata, were very closely matched to their sampled densities in almost all habitats (species specific evaluations included under species accounts).
While missed ratios are especially useful in this way, the pattern of missed ratios is also helpful in understanding which habitats, islands, and species are particularly favorable for detection (few missed) or particularly difficult (many missed). Tables of missed ratios are given under the relevant species accounts.
Validity of the sampling methods. - Of the various sampling techniques, total removal has the highest face validity (Rodda et al. 2001), in that the local population is totally enumerated (“censused”) rather than sampled (“surveyed”), but the total removal method is not strictly applicable to all species. For example, it is not intended for use on subterranean species such as the Brahminy Blindsnake, Ramphotyphlops braminus. Species that may aestivate underground – here the Cane Toad, Rhinella marina - could also be missed. Large climbing lizards such as the Mangrove Monitor, Varanus indicus can probably vault the barrier and are at such low density that quantification using total removal plots is unlikely to be informative. For the appropriate species, however, total removal sampling is unequivocal and precise, with no ambiguity about the size of the area sampled (unlike index methods and mark-recapture, for which quantification of the area sampled can be elusive) or the number of individuals found therein. Total removal is also the only method under consideration that provides size distributions, biomasses, sex ratios and other unbiased demographic information.
87

Glueboard sampling seems to work best for strictly terrestrial species such as the Curious Skink, Carlia ailanpalai (Rodda et al. 2005b). The technique’s primary weakness is that it is imprecise (wide confidence limits) and index values are often not strictly proportional to absolute abundance. Thus, for example, an index value of 6 cannot be interpreted as having twice the absolute population density found in a site where the same species has an index value of 3. Glueboard capture rates cannot be legitimately compared among species, and other restrictions may apply (Rodda et al. 2005b). For example, it may not give appropriate relative abundances when making comparisons among habitats or islands.

Visual surveys may be the best choice for estimating relative abundance of arboreal species (Rodda et al. 2005a), though the confidence intervals may be even wider than for glueboard samples, indicating low precision. Species-specific modulators of visual detection can be inferred from the visual missed ratio tables given in the species accounts.

RESULTS

Glueboard sampling. - Glueboard yields are given in Table 7 (1989) and Table 8 (2008).

Table 7. 1989 Glueboard capture rates (captures per trap-hr). An empty cell indicates that appropriate trapping did not occur for the indicated species at the indicated site. See species accounts for details of appropriate conditions. See Table 1 for placement and number of trap-hours at each locality. Single additional specimens of Lepidodactylus lugubris and Varanus indicus were caught at CPNB. Glueboards used in 1989 were of a different adhesive and configuration than in 2008, so capture rates are not directly comparable.

Table 10. Detection rates (sightings/person-hr) during nighttime visual surveys on military lease lands, Tinian, 2008. Values for BRN6 are somewhat approximate, as the large number of simultaneous detections made it difficult to scrupulously avoid double counting of moving individuals. See Table 4 for person-hrs and capture sample sizes. Omitted lizards had sighting rates of zero. BRN6 was also unusual in being isolated trees in the median of a road; therefore it was not averaged with LSUM to characterize mixed forest visual detection rates. Anolis carolinensis and Lamprolepis smaragdina were actively spreading their ranges at the time of our samples; therefore it was not appropriate to characterize their relative abundances in Leucaena forest by combining sites where the species was present with those sites not yet reached.

Total removal sampling. - For comparisons within a species it is appropriate to consider the absolute densities revealed by total removal sampling (Table 11), but for comparisons among species it is perhaps more appropriate to consider the biomass distribution, as one individual of a large species may consume many times the energy and space that is occupied by a smaller species (Table 12, Figure 2). The most striking attribute of the biomass distribution by fundamental niche (Table 12) is the paucity of terrestrial species biomass, especially in limestone forest, where it constituted only about 1% of lizard biomass. Native species did not constitute as much as half of the lizard biomass in any sampled habitat.

Figure 3. The Oceanic Snake-eyed Skink, Cryptoblepharus poecilopleurus.
Previous studies – Note that the nominal species is under revision and is likely to contain a number of island endemics in the South Pacific (Horner 2007, G. Zug, 2008 pers. comm.), but the form in the Mariana Islands is relatively widespread in the northwestern Pacific. Because this littoral clade has extensively speciated on islands (reflecting an evolutionarily long residence in the area of speciation), and because this particular species is endemic to the northern Pacific, it is assumed that this species reached many islands on its own (i.e., it was not introduced by man). Because it is very small and its skeleton is fragile, it is not a good candidate for preservation as a subfossil in prehuman remains. Thus we assume it is likely native despite the absence of reported subfossils in prehuman strata (Pregill 1998).
This species is found in a variety of microhabitats, including Casuarina (Australian pine) groves, rocky and sandy areas, grass, leaf litter around Cocos (coconut) palms, etc. (McCoid et al. 1995). The unifying factor in this range of habitat types, however, is that these microhabitats must be closely associated with the littoral zone. For example, C. peocilopleurus has been collected on and around Casuarina, but only when the trees are immediately adjacent to the shore. Vogt and Williams (2004) report occasional specimens from upland situations (limestone forest implied by not explicitly stated) on Saipan and the Northern Mariana Islands, though these may be associated with cliffs (also found around upland cliffs on Rota (Rodda, pers. obs.). The exception is on Guguan, where this species occurs throughout the island as a sand swimmer in ash fields (McCoid et al. 1995). Vogt (2008) comments that its former presence on Sarigan
1 Sizes given above photographs are ranges for specimens from the Mariana Islands.
95

(Northern Mariana Islands) may have been attributable to soil disturbance associated with dense populations of goats. It is possible that goat-churned soil could provide a loose soil niche similar to that found in ash fields on Guguan.
The first record of this species on Tinian was three specimens collected by Norm Scott and Herman Muna from Leucaena trees at the shrine at Puntan Tahgong (our site PTAH) in 1985 (Wiles et al. 1989). These Leucaena trees were immediately adjacent to a Pemphis belt that occurs in the salt spray zone of the point. We trapped the same place four years later (Table 1), but found only Carlia (Table 73). We did find Cryptoblepharus poecilopleurus in strand forest at nearby Unai Chulu in 1989 (Tables 3, 9). These were the only published records for Tinian prior to this study.
This study (2008) – We found the Snake-eyed Skink (Cryptoblepharus poecilopleurus) at only two sites: adjacent to Unai Chulu (beach) and in the B29W total removal plot just northeast of North Field. The Unai Chulu population was expected, as the species is associated with strand habitat. However, the B29W total removal plot was nearly 1 km inland, in North Field’s characteristic monotypic stands of Leucaena. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first record for this species anywhere in Leucaena habitat or at a great distance from cliff or strand habitat. On the windward side of North Field the Leucaena stands were stunted by the prevailing winds and salt spray, and therefore the B29W site was not as far inland in a habitat sense as simple distance from the coast would suggest. Nonetheless, this discovery undermines our confidence in predicting the full distribution of the species on Tinian. Prior to this discovery we would have confidently predicted that the species would occur only immediately adjacent to salt water, especially in the vicinity of Casuarina stands, strand vegetation or cliffs. However, the detection in a Leucaena stand indicates that it might occur in a variety of sites on the military lease lands of Tinian. It is not, however, present throughout, as we found it in only the two sites mentioned.
Management recommendations - The nominal species has an extensive distribution throughout the northwestern Pacific, though some of these localities may be of closely-related species. It is found along the coast of virtually all of the Mariana Islands, including the far northern islands. As presently understood the species is not considered to be at risk of endangerment or in need of special management. As with all of Tinian’s native species, the most important protection is prevention of new introductions. It is notable that Hawley (2008) and Vogt (2008) observed a recent apparent decline of this species on Sarigan; Vogt suggested that the species may benefit from soil disturbance by ungulates. Monitoring soil conditions in conjunction with monitoring populations of this species may shed light on limiting factors.

Littoral Skink, Emoia atrocostata
Body length: 28 - 85 mm Mass: 0.6 – 11.0 g
Figure 4. The Littoral Skink, Emoia atrocostata. Previous studies – This species was not previously known to occur on Tinian,
though it was known to occur on small islands both north (e.g., Saipan outlier Maigo Luao) and south (Aguiguan) of Tinian (Rodda et al. 1991). Throughout its vast range it occurs in two habitat types: mangrove mud flats and rocky coasts having tide pools. In Palau, it occurs in both of these habitat types. In the Marianas it is known only from tide pool areas (hence the alternate common name: Tide-pool Skink), especially associated with the shrub Pemphis, which occurs in the salt-sprayed area immediately inland of the intertidal zone on high-energy rocky shorelines. This is the only suitable habitat for this species on military lease lands of Tinian.
Because this species is strictly limited to the littoral zone, it would not be expected to be found in the upland caves sampled for subfossil material by Pregill (1998), and it was not found there. However, as this taxon is a superlative colonizer of remote islands, and is endemic to the Pacific basin (including Indo-Pacific areas), we treat it as a native species.
This study (2008) – We found the Littoral Skink (Emoia atrocostata) to be reasonably common in the Pemphis zone north of Unai Chulu. We did not find it in similar habitat at Puntan Tahgong (Ushi Point), or in strand forest 10-20 m inland from the Pemphis zone of Unai Chulu. Carlia ailanpalai is the dominant terrestrial lizard in the Pemphis zone at Puntan Tahgong and several other places where we looked, but it is likely that additional populations of E. atrocostata will be discovered in Pemphis habitat.
Management recommendations – As this skink is widely distributed (Pacific and Indian Oceans) and common, this is not a species of special concern. However, the absence of the skink from typical habitat such as that found at Puntan Tahgong, and its
97

possible replacement by the introduced Curious Skink (Carlia ailanpalai) suggests that monitoring of these two species be continued in the Pemphis zone to determine whether the introduced skink displaces the native one.
Pacific Blue-tailed Skink, Emoia caeruleocauda
Body length: 21 – 56 mm Mass: 0.1 – 3.7 g
Figure 5. The Pacific Blue-tailed Skink, Emoia atrocostata. Previous studies – The colorful and conspicuous Pacific Blue-tailed Skink (Emoia
caeruleocauda) is found from Borneo to Vanuatu and throughout the western Pacific on the ground and low in vegetation in forested areas (Brown 1991). Pregill (1998) found it in early prehistoric subfossil material, but did not record it in prehuman strata. However, it is endemic to western Oceania and therefore is presumably native to at least some of the islands therein. For that reason we treat it as native to the Mariana Islands.
In the Marianas it is the only common native skink still found throughout most islands (Rodda et al. 1991). However, on Tinian it has been largely replaced (Wiles et al. 1989) by the introduced Curious Skink. It is not known if this replacement has been due to direct interaction between the species or an indirect interaction, such as a reciprocal response to a habitat feature (e.g., one species prefers drier areas; the other prefers wetter areas). Previous studies have found the blue-tailed skink to be largely missing from the extensive Leucaena stands on military lease lands of Tinian (Wiles et al. 1989).
This study (2008) – Our observations corroborated earlier studies showing this species to be rare or possibly absent from most Leucaena habitat on military lease lands of Tinian. We found it only in or near native forest on Mt. Lasu (LASW total removal plot; seen near LASS; one trapped at LASN) in low numbers. It was present in the one of our mixed forest total removal sites that was on Mt. Lasu, but was absent from the one on North Field. From this limited information it is impossible to determine whether the difference is geographic or due to proximity to native forest.
