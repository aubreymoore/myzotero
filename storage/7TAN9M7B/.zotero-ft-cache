Genetic analyses using highly variable DNA-based genetic markers can provide useful information for developing conservation plans for migrant birds. For example, analyses of population genetic structure can help deﬁne demographically distinct management units (cf. Moritz 1994) while identiﬁcation of population-speciﬁc genetic variants enable the use of genetic ‘tags’ to study the movement patterns of individuals between breeding and wintering populations (Wenink & Baker 1996). Although a number of microsatellite loci have been isolated for some species of neotropical migrants (e.g. Dawson et al. 1997), the availability of loci for this group of birds remains limited. Here, we describe the isolation of variable microsatellite DNA loci which can be

used for individual and population-level genetic analyses of a member of this group, the Swainson’s thrush (Catharus ustulatus ).
We studied thrushes in Prince Albert National Park, Saskatchewan from May to July 1994. Blood samples were collected from individually marked adults captured using song play-backs to lure individual birds into mist nets. DNA was then extracted from these samples using standard phenol–chloroform techniques and quantiﬁed using a ﬂuorometer. We analysed DNA from 24 adults for the analyses described here.
To isolate microsatellite loci we digested 10 µg of thrush DNA (2 µg from each of ﬁve birds combined) with 10 U each of AluI, HaeIII, and RsaI and then cloned genomic fragments 350 – 450 bp in length into the SmaI site of the pUC18 plasmid vector. The screening of colonies was then performed by hybridizing ﬁlters with probes made by labelling three dinucleotide polymer tracts (TG)n (TC)n, and (GC)n (Pharmacia) with [α32P]-dCTP using random priming. Primary and secondary screening of approximately 17 000 colonies yielded a total of 27 positive clones. These clones were then cycle sequenced (AmpliCycle; Perkin-Elmer) and primers were designed to amplify regions containing a microsatellite repeat for six of these clones (Table 1).
To assay variation among individuals, PCR reactions were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 480 DNA Cycler in 10 µL volumes, each containing 50 ng of genomic DNA, 0.25 pmoles of the forward primer end-labelled with [γ33P]-ATP, 0.25 pmoles of unlabelled forward primer, 0.5 pmoles of unlabelled reverse primer, 300 µm dNTPs, 0.25 U AmpliTaq (PerkinElmer), 0.1 m Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 0.5 m KCl, and 2.5 mm MgCl2. Following an initial denaturing step at 94 °C for 3 min, 30

cycles of PCR were carried out, each cycle consisting of 45 s at 94 °C, 45 s at Tm in Table 1, and 45 s at 72 °C. Ampliﬁcation products were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide denaturing gels containing 7.7 m urea. Gels were run at 55 W for 2 h. Dried gels were exposed to BIOMAX (Kodak) X-ray ﬁlm overnight. Product sizes were determined by reference to a sequencing reaction of a known template, and a clone of known size for each locus run every 10 lanes.
All loci were variable with between 7 and 20 alleles among the adults surveyed; the frequency of the most common allele ranged from 0.15 to 0.58 (Table 1). Expected and observed heterozygosities are not signiﬁcantly different for any locus (Table 1) with the exception that there is a signiﬁcant (P = 0.029) deﬁciency of certain heterozygotes at Cuµ 05 as determined using exact tests in genepop (Raymond & Rousset 1995), suggesting the possible presence of a null allele(s) at low frequency at this locus. The usefulness of these loci for parentage analyses was determined by calculating the probability of detecting the occurrence of an extrapair fertilization by an additional male (assuming known maternity) (P[E] ) using the formula in Chakravarti & Li (1983). The overall P(E) value is 0.999, indicating that when the six loci are used for parentage analyses there is a 99.9% chance of detecting extrapair paternity within nests of this species. Finally, four of these loci (Cuµ 02, 04, 10, and 28) appear to amplify polymorphic loci in some distantly related passerine species. Speciﬁcally, the following loci are variable in these birds: yellow warbler (Dendroica petechia), Cuµ 28; grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), Cuµ 02, 04, and 28; ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), Cuµ 02, 04, and 28; brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater), Cuµ 04, 10, and 28.

Oryctes virus (OrV), ﬁrst described by Huger (1966), is an unusual virus which can infect some members of the insect family Scarabaeidae (Coleoptera). Presently designated as an ‘unassigned virus’ (Murphy et al. 1995), it is primarily a pathogen of the palm pest, Oryctes rhinoceros (rhinoceros beetle), against which it has been successfully used as a biocontrol agent throughout the Paciﬁc and Indo-Asia. The virus is also under assessment as a control agent for Papuana spp. (Scarabaeidae), pests of taro, which it is not known to infect naturally. Detecting OrV infections can be difﬁcult and usually involves examining for symptoms of a whitened, swollen gut (Zelazny 1978) with conﬁrmation by electron microscopy. We have developed a set of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) primers which speciﬁcally detect OrV from insect host material and could be used for the routine detection of the disease. Such screening will greatly enhance knowledge of the epizootiology of OrV, both in O. rhinoceros and potential new hosts.
HindIII and EcoRI fragments of the 17.7 kb PstI D fragment of OrV DNA (Fig. 1), originating from strain PV505 (Crawford et al. 1985), were cloned into the pUC19 vector and sequenced (GeneBank Accession no. AF126716). Primers were designed to amplify OrV fragments (Fig. 1; Table 1) and tested against larval and adult gut samples from O. rhinoceros and Papuana spp. collected in Papua New Guinea (PNG). The majority of guts showed no visual symptoms of OrV infection. Samples were stored at 4 °C in either 70% ethanol or buffer (0.05 m Tris pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). Tissue culture-grown OrV was included as a positive control and water as a negative control. Speciﬁcity of one primer pair, OrV15a/15b, was examined using gut extracts from a range of other Scarabaeidae, including the New Zealand species, Costelytra zealandica, Odontria sp., Chlorochiton sp. and Adoryphorus couloni, which had never been exposed to OrV.
Approximately 50 mg portions of insect guts were macerated in 500 µL of disruption buffer (100 mm Tris pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mg/mL proteinase K) and incubated either overnight at 37 °C or for 3 h at 65 °C. Samples were twice phenol–chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated and then resuspended in 200 µL of sdH2O.
PCR reactions (25 µL) contained 0.4 µm of each primer (Gibco BRL), 200 µm dNTPs (Boehringer Mannheim), 2.5 µL of reaction buffer, and 2 µL of DNA. Three polymerases were compared: Taq (0.625 U/reaction) (Boehringer Mannheim), ExpandTM High Fidelity Taq (0.7 U/reaction) (Boehringer Mannheim) and ‘Red Hot’ Taq (0.6 U/reaction) (Advanced

Biotechnologies, UK). A MgCl2 concentration of 2.5 mm per reaction was found to be optimal for both Expand and Red Hot Taq polymerases. Ampliﬁcation was performed in a Perkin-Elmer 480 thermal cycler using 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 45 °C and 2 min at 72 °C.
Replacement of Boehringer Mannheim Taq with Expand or Red Hot Taq signiﬁcantly improved detection. Both phenol–chloroform extraction and proteinase K disruption were necessary steps as ampliﬁcation from nonextracted insect tissue was poor. An extensive investigation of the optimal dilution of processed samples (100, 10 −1 and 10 −2) demonstrated that most virus-positive results came from the 10-fold dilution. Some larval samples with high levels of gut organic matter could not be puriﬁed and never produced OrV-positive bands.
Positive PCR results were strongly correlated with visual disease symptoms in O. rhinoceros adults. In addition, a high proportion of the insects that appeared healthy but probed positive were collected from sites where the virus was known to be present. The OrV15a/15b primer pair detected OrV in > 40% of the O. rhinoceros larval samples, which are particularly difﬁcult to visually assess for OrV infection. OrV was detected in Papuana spp. which had ingested large quantities of virus (exposed by swimming in virus stock), but no larval Papuana spp. collected from ﬁeld sites or New Zealand scarab samples produced positive results, indicating that the primers are speciﬁc to the virus. In conclusion, the primer pair OrV15a/15b has proven useful for the routine detection of OrV. The virus was detected from tissue before visual symptoms

Development of conservation and management plans can be aided by genetic data, and the utility of microsatellites for studies of genetic variability, population structure, gene ﬂow, and relatedness makes these loci appropriate for studies of declining natural populations. Wood warblers (Parulidae), a New World family of 115 species of 25 genera, have played an important role in studies of avian ecology, evolution, hybridization, and behaviour. Also, 7% of the species are threatened or endangered (Collar et al. 1992), and populations of other species are locally threatened or declining.
We developed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays of microsatellite loci for Swainson’s Warbler (Limnothlypis swainsonii), the only species in the genus Limnothlypis and among the rarest wood warblers in North America (Brown & Dickson 1994). Our PCR primers were tested for their ability to amplify orthologous loci in 19 other wood warblers and ﬁve other species of three different families.
Protocols used to obtain and score microsatellites (Glenn 1997) involved ligating 300 –700 bp fragments of genomic DNA into a plasmid and enriching for dinucleotide micro-

satellites using d(AG)12 and d(AC)12 or d(AG)12 and d(TG)15 (Ostrander et al. 1992). Transformed bacterial colonies were screened by hybridization with radioactively labelled d(AG)12 and d(TG)15. Sixty positive clones were sequenced following Meeker et al. (1993) or Rouer (1994) using Sequenase 2.0 (US Biochemical). PCR primers were designed from sequences ﬂanking the repetitive elements. Genomic DNA was extracted using a diatomaceous earth/guanidine thiocyanate extraction protocol (Carter & Milton 1993) and diluted to 20 ng/µL for use in PCR experiments.
Ampliﬁcation protocols for each primer pair were optimized to amplify Limnothlypis swainsonii DNA using the highest possible annealing temperatures, the lowest Mg concentration, dUTP when possible, and BSA when necessary. dUTP was substituted for TTP to allow enzymatic degradation of carryover contaminants (Longo et al. 1990). Because dUTP is incorporated less efﬁciently by Taq DNA polymerase, TTP was used for loci not amplifying with dUTP. Following optimization, ampliﬁcation experiments were conducted using Promega Thermo buffer (ﬁnal concentrations 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 9, 1% Triton X-100), 2 mm MgCl2, 150 µM dNTPs (Table 1), 1 unit Taq DNA polymerase (Promega), 0.5 µM each primer, and 80 ng of DNA. For some primer pairs, optimization included addition of 125 ng/mL BSA (Table 1). A Perkin-Elmer Model 480 Thermal Cycler was used with Midwest Scientiﬁc thermal tubes under

these conditions: 3 min 45 s at 94 °C; then 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, primer-speciﬁc annealing temperature (see Table 1) for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Negative and positive controls were used in all ampliﬁcation experiments. Twelve µL of completed PCR reaction were run in 1.5% agarose minigels containing ethidium bromide. GelMarker I (Research Genetics) was used to judge relative size and yield of PCR products. Results were examined under UV light and an Eagle Eye I was used to record ﬂuorescence.
Following optimization, variation within L. swainsonii was assessed at each locus using two individuals each from ﬁve breeding populations (North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Louisiana, Arkansas). Cross-species ampliﬁcation experiments were conducted by testing individuals for ampliﬁability using each primer pair separately in a 50 µL PCR reaction.
Five of the 15 microsatellite primer pairs ampliﬁed loci showing no variation within Swainson’s Warbler (GenBank Accession nos: AF129098–AF129102). Two showed polymorphism, but were not scoreable (Table 1). In both cases two loci may have been amplifying. The eight remaining loci

showed 2–8 alleles among the 10 individuals screened (mean of 6.4 alleles/locus; Table 1). Linear regression showed no correlation between maximum repeat length and the number of alleles occurring at each locus.
In cross-species ampliﬁcation experiments only Limnothlypis ampliﬁed at every locus. Considering only perfect ampliﬁcations (‘ + ’ in Table 2), other Parulidae showed ampliﬁcation at from 0 to 8 loci (mean of 4.9; Table 2). Species in the families Ptilonorhynchidae, Thraupidae, and Turdidae ampliﬁed at from 0 to 4 loci (Table 2), with a mean of 2.0 loci.
Loci developed in Limnothlypis ampliﬁed broadly, but with notable variability, among other species of songbirds. It is anticipated that these loci will prove useful for investigations of population genetics, geographic variation, speciation, hybridization, paternity, migration, and behaviour in this widely studied group of birds.

Thousands of microsatellite loci have been identiﬁed as part of the Human Genome Programme. Their evolutionary conservation allows for successful cross-species ampliﬁcation in related species using the same primers and ampliﬁcation

conditions (Coote & Bruford 1996). Human polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers have been applied to several primate species (e.g. Morin et al. 1994; Gerloff et al. 1995; Kayser et al. 1996). Similar degrees of polymorphism are found at the equivalent primate microsatellite loci, and they can be used to discriminate between individuals. As more than ﬁve alleles often segregate within a population (e.g. Morin et al. 1994), microsatellites are highly suited as Mendelian markers for pedigree and population analyses (e.g. Coote & Bruford 1996). Sequential typing of up to 12 such loci from 20 individuals can accurately characterize genetic variability within a population (Altmann et al. 1996). We report data about cross-species ampliﬁcation in western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) for 32 human microsatellite markers. This work forms part of a population genetic study examining microsatellite variation throughout the lowland gorilla range using shed hairs as the DNA source material.
Genomic DNA was extracted from blood collected from 10 captive gorillas (Wickings & Dixson 1992). DNA was extracted from hair as follows: roots of 3– 6 hairs from each individual were agitated in 250 µL of 5% chelex, 10 mm Tris pH 8.0 for approximately 24 h at 56 °C. Samples were vortexed vigorously, boiled for 15 min, vortexed and spun for 3 min. The supernatant was stored at 4 °C.
PCR ampliﬁcation at 32 microsatellite loci was carried out using blood-derived DNA, in a 20 µL volume using a Hybaid Omnigene Thermal Cycler. Twenty pmoles 5′-primer was end-labelled using T4 polynucleotide kinase with [γ 32P]ATP. The reaction mix contained 20 –100 ng of DNA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mg/mL BSA, 0.2 mm dNTP, 20 pmoles labelled primer, 20 pmoles 3′-primer and 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase. For dinucleotides initial denaturation was for 3 min at 93 °C followed by seven cycles of 30 s at 93 °C, 60 s at either 50 °C or 54 °C and 90 s at 72 °C, followed by 30 cycles of 45 s at 93 °C, 90 s at 55 °C or 59 °C and 120 s at 72 °C with 10 min at 72 °C after the last cycle. For tetranucleotides initial denaturation was 2 min at 93 °C followed by 35 cycles of 10 s at 94 °C, 15 s at 58 °C and 15 s at 72 °C, with 10 min at 72 °C after the last cycle. PCR products were electrophoresed on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized on autoradiographic ﬁlm exposed for 12 –72 h. Allele sizes were determined by comparison with previously sequenced human alleles or a M13 sequence ladder.
At the 32 loci tested, three or more alleles were detected at 21 loci (Table 1). As the aim of this study is to characterize a series of loci for use in noninvasively collected hair samples, these 21 loci were examined in hair-derived DNA from wild gorillas; only eight ampliﬁed consistently, i.e. gave identical ampliﬁcation products in at least two PCRs (Table 2). Heterozygosity was reduced in this larger sample set, perhaps due to errors associated with using DNA derived from shed hair, as observed in other studies (Taberlet et al. 1996; Gagneaux et al. 1997). In this study marked differences in ampliﬁcation success and accuracy were seen between DNA extracted from blood or from shed hairs. We are currently characterizing 16 different gorilla populations using these polymorphic microsatellite loci.

The acorn barnacle Semibalanus balanoides is widely distributed in the intertidal rocky shores of both East and West Atlantic, north of Cape Atteras (USA) and northwestern Spain. The species also occurs on the Paciﬁc coast of southern Alaska (Flowerdew 1983). S. balanoides has been traditionally used as a model organism in studies of factors shaping marine invertebrate communities (Menge & Sutherland 1976). Much less work has been devoted to the molecular ecology of this species. Of particular interest is a recent study of S. balanoides populations from the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Canada) that revealed a genetic discontinuity of allelic frequencies at two enzymatic loci (Mpi and Gpi) in the vicinity of the Miramichi estuary in the southern part of the Gulf (Holm & Bourget 1994). These authors proposed that selection imposed by thermal gradients was probably responsible for such genetic patterns in the absence of physical barriers to gene ﬂow. In order to further elucidate the respective roles of selection and gene ﬂow on the genetic structure of S. balanoides from that region, we developed primers for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ampliﬁcations of ﬁve microsatellite loci. DNA was extracted from whole barnacles collected in Le Goulet, New-Brunswick, using standard phenol– chloroform techniques (Sambrook et al. 1989). Fifty µg of genomic DNA was digested using Sau3AI restriction enzyme. DNA fragments ranging from 400 to 900 bp were selected (as suggested in Estoup & Turgeon 1996), excised from a 1.7% agarose gel and puriﬁed using a QIAGEN extraction kit. The puriﬁed DNA was ligated into the pUC18 BamHI/BAP vector (‘Ready to go’ kit, Pharmacia). The ligation products were transformed into XL-1 Blue competent cells following Estoup & Turgeon (1996). Approximately 3000 recombinant clones were obtained and screened with the following probes: (CT)10(GT)10 (CAC)5(CA), CT(CCT)5, CT(ATCT)6 and (TGTA)6, using the nonradioactive DIG nucleic acid detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim). A total of 24 putative positive clones were extracted using the QIAprep plasmid DNA prep kit (Qiagen). Sequencing reactions were obtained using ABI prism BigDye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kits (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems) and run on a 373 stretch XL automated sequencer. Only seven of the 24 clones contained sequences with more than six repeats. Primers could be designed for ﬁve loci using both OSP (Hillier & Green 1991) and OLIGO™ version 4.0 (National Biosciences) software programs (Table 1). PCR ampliﬁcations were carried out using a Perkin-Elmer 480 DNA thermal cycler using α35S in 20-µL reactions containing template DNA (50–100 ng), 10 pmol of each primer, 75 µm each of dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, 5 µm dATP, 1.5 µCi of [α35S]-dATP, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1× Taq buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9), 50 mm (KCl) and 0.25 units of Taq polymerase. The PCR conditions were: denaturation for 3 min at 95 °C, followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 30 s of annealing at 59 °C, extension for 1 min at 72 °C followed by a ﬁnal elongation step of 5 min at 72 °C. Electrophoresis, ﬁxation, drying, and autoradiography were performed following standard procedures (Sambrook et al. 1989). The M13 sequence was used as a size control.

To assess polymorphism at each locus, we screened 30 individual barnacles from Anse Bleue, New-Brunswick. Observed and expected heterozygosity at each locus were calculated using version 3.0 of the genepop software package (Raymond & Rousset 1995). All ﬁve microsatellite markers revealed high polymorphism, with numbers of alleles per locus ranging from 3 to 16 for the population studied (Table 1). Gene diversity at each locus varied between 0.37 and 0.83. Signiﬁcant deﬁcits in heterozygotes were observed for locus Sebal98, and particularly for Sebal916. This may indicate the presence of null alleles at those loci. Alternatively, departures from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium for other reasons, such as ﬁne-scale structuring and/or selection, cannot be ruled out at this stage.
To our knowledge, these loci represent the ﬁrst published microsatellites for barnacles. The level of polymorphism detected with microsatellites is much greater than what has been found for allozymes (Flowerdew 1983) and will be adequate to address population structure questions. In addition, the most polymorphic loci (Sebal14, Sebal35 and Sebal98) should also be of interest for paternity analysis.

The black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) was once widely distributed across Africa but is now listed as endangered (Baillie & Groombridge 1996). Since the 1970s, poaching has reduced the total population by 96%, and at the present time less than 2400 individuals remain in highly fragmented populations spanning 9 –12 countries (International Rhino Foundation 1998). Two D.b. michaeli individuals from Kenya and a group of D.b. minor from Chete National Park in Zimbabwe form an ex situ breeding conservation programme at Western Plains Zoo, Australia. Here we describe 11 (CA)n microsatellite

loci ampliﬁed from D.b. minor and D.b. michaeli that were developed to assess genetic diversity in this captive colony.
Microsatellites were isolated from a partial genomic library, generated from HaeIII-, HpaI- and EcoRI-digested D.b. minor genomic DNA, as described by Burns & Houlden (1999). Microsatellite loci were ampliﬁed using M13 primers. Cycle sequencing was performed using ﬂuorochromelabelled nucleotides and the dideoxy termination method (Sanger et al. 1977). Sequencing was conducted using Pop6™ or Pop4™ acryilamide gels and a 310 capillary system (ABI)®. Primer pairs were designed for 11 loci using primer 0.5 (Lincoln et al. 1991) (Table 1). Microsatellite ampliﬁcation was obtained using 0.5 Units of Red Hot™ thermostable DNA polymerase (Advanced Biotechnologies, Australia), 0.25 mm dNTPs, 1.5 – 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm (NH4)2SO4, 75 mm Tris-HCl pH 9.0, 0.01%(w/v) Tween-20 (Buffer IV, Advanced Biotechnologies), and 5 –15 pmol of each primer in 25 µL. The PCR proﬁle was as follows; (95 °C for 3 min, 58 – 64 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 30 s) for one cycle (95 °C for 30 s, 58 – 64 °C for 20 – 30 s (Table 1), 72 °C for 30 s) for 30 cycles and (95 °C for 30 s, 58 – 64 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 min) for the ﬁnal cycle. Products were electrophoresed on Pop4™ acryilamide gels on a 310 capillary system (ABI)®. Genescan-500™ TAMRA was used for fragment size calibration. Statistical analysis of microsatellite variation was performed using biosys (Swofford & Selander 1981).
A high degree of allelic diversity remained in the captive populations, despite the recent severe bottleneck experienced

by wild founder populations. Between two and seven alleles were detected at each locus (Table 1). The mean number of alleles per locus (± standard error) for the D.b. minor (n = 5) and D.b. michaeli (n = 2) subspecies were 3.1 ± 0.3 and 2.6 ± 0.2, respectively, with a mean of 4.2 ± 0.5 for all D. bicornis individuals (n = 7). Each locus showed moderate to high levels of heterozygosity overall (Table 1). Levels of expected heterozygosity (± standard error) were 0.594 ± 0.068 for D.b. minor and 0.682 ± 0.085 for D.b. michaeli, and 0.686 ± 0.043 for all D. bicornis individuals.
Although our sample size is small, the high level of observed heterozygosity is consistent with those observed in studies by Swart & Ferguson (1997). These results contrast with earlier studies using allozyme analysis (Osterhoff & Keep 1970; Merenlender et al. 1989).
