 Hafa Adai Dr. Moore,

 

I hope all is well out on Guam.

That is a good question about Borrelia burgdorferi and Guam.  It is sometimes confusing when you see a distribution map of Lyme cases and they show up in odd locations such as Guam or Hawaii.  The cause of the discrepancy is that cases are recorded where they are reported not where they are acquired.  That is just a fact of life for public health reporting systems.  Tourists from the mainland USA or parts of temperate Asia could easily arrive with Lyme disease and present at a clinic.

I have a paper somewhere from the nice folks at the territorial public health dept. that detailed all of the various zoonotic and vector borne diseases from Guam.  It a short 2 page list of events with a few annotations.  I can look to see if they presented any more on that Lyme case.

 

The short answer to the question is "Definitively No".  

Lyme and Borrelia burgdorferi are essentially temperate region in distribution.  The major vectors are all Ixodes spp. in a relatively small subgroup of Ixodes on a whole.  You do not have any of the vectors of Borrelia burgdorferi on Guam.

 

Back a few years ago I did some work with tick , flea, mite, and louse-borne pathogens on Guam and some other islands out in the Pacific.  I'll attach those papers.  Basically you have a few tick borne spotted fever and flea-borne pathogens such as the agent of cat scratch disease.

 

Regards

 

Will

Abstract—We conducted a 3-week field study of ectoparasites of humans

and domestic animals throughout Guam. Thirteen species of ectoparasitic

arthropods were collected. Ectoparasites of medical or veterinary sig- nificance included the ticks Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Rhipicephalus

microplus, fleas Ctenocephalides felis and Xenopsylla cheopsis, and

the head louse Pediculus humanus capitis. Polymerase chain reaction

based screening for rickettsial and protozoan pathogens detected patho- gens in eight arthropods. These included Anaplasma platys, Anaplasma

marginale, Coxiella burnetii, Babesia canis vogeli, and Hepatozoon canis.

Guam is a tropical Pacific island with a history of vector-borne disease out- breaks. Based on unpublished epidemiological data from the Guam Public Health

Department, there have been epidemics and introductions of numerous vector- borne tropical diseases throughout the history of the island. Infected individuals

arrive in Guam from neighboring islands, Asia, Australia, and the Americas and

present at hospitals. For example, an outbreak of Japanese encephalitis occurred

in the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands in 1990 (Paul et al. 1993),

and some infected individuals traveled to Guam for treatment. Other diseases

such as murine typhus and tick-borne rickettsial diseases are inevitably present on

Guam and remain unreported or misdiagnosed.

Ectoparasite-borne rickettsial diseases have historically caused significant

morbidity and mortality for militaries throughout the world (Moe & Pedersen

1980). Projected military buildups on Guam increase the chances of human and

vector exposure. There is no active surveillance of vector-borne diseases at major

ports of entry, major military installations, National Guard facilities, or by the

Guam Public Health Department.

Most published reports of vectors and pathogens on Guam are 30–60 years

old (Alicata 1948, Kohls 1957, Hammon et al. 1958, Hopkins 1961, Wilson 1967,

1972a, 1972b) and probably no longer accurate. Continuous surveillance for vec- tors is critical for protecting human and veterinary health. New exotic species and

associated pathogens can be introduced on planes or ships when tourists and their

pets travel to Guam. For example, exotic black flies (Simuliidae) were discovered

on Guam in 2010 (Reeves & Adler 2011). Thousands of tourists travel to Guam

annually, and when even small percentages are infected with pathogens, the risk

for introducing disease is significant. For example, a Japanese tourist with schis- tosomiasis was documented traveling to Guam when he presented at a hospital for

complications (Matsuda et al. 1999). Unfortunately, many vector-borne diseases

can be misdiagnosed as better known diseases such as measles, rubella, hepatitis,

or nonspecific “flu-like” illnesses. Outbreaks of introduced diseases are possible,

so continued vigilance is needed to detect and prevent epidemics. The combina- tion of a year-round tropical climate, introduced pathogens, established vectors,

and lack of medical surveillance could be disastrous. With plans for a continued

military buildup on Guam, an active surveillance system is critically needed.

We conducted a 3-week vector and pathogen survey in March 2010 on mili- tary bases and civilian sites throughout the island and collected a wide range of

arthropods of medical and veterinary significance. New records of mosquitoes,

black flies, and biting midges are reported elsewhere (Nunn et al. 2011, Reeves &

Adler 2011, Rueda et al. 2011, Swanson & Reeves 2011). We report on the ecto- parasites and molecular surveillance of associated pathogens.

Materials and Methods

Ectoparasites were collected by hand by U.S. Department of Defense, Depart- ment of Agriculture, and Guam Public Health Department personnel at veterinary

clinics during routine examinations or from dead animals trapped by pest control

personnel or found on roads. Head lice were collected by Guam Public Health

Department personnel from humans. Specimens were identified by comparison

to reference materials or with the taxonomic keys and published records for fleas,

lice, and ticks (Wilson 1967, 1972a, 1972b, Hopkins 1961, Kohls 1957).

Reeves et al.: Pathogens and vectors in Guam. 227

Initially each ectoparasite was macerated with a sterile razorblade and crushed

with a Teflon pestle before digesting the remains with Protinase K. Total DNA was

extracted from individual or pooled ectoparasites (Table 1) with a DNeasy Blood

& Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California) and resuspended in 10% tris-HCL and

nuclease free water. Extracts were screened for DNA from Anaplasma, Bartonella,

Coxiella burnetii, Ehrlichia, and Rickettsia by real time polymerase chain reaction

(PCR) following the protocols described by Loftis et al. (2006). Ticks from dogs

were tested for Babesia spp. and Hepatozoon canis using the PCR assays described

by Kledmanee et al. (2009). Fleas, mites, and chewing lice were tested for filarial

nematodes using the PCR assays described by Nuchprayoon et al. (2005). Posi- tive samples were further characterized by sequencing DNA from PCR amplicons.

Controls included a distilled water negative control and a positive control consist- ing of unique synthetic DNA oligonucleotides that corresponded to the primers

and probe. These oligonucleotides have sequences unlike any known agent and

can be differentiated from real agents by DNA sequencing if positive control con- tamination was suspected. We amplified DNA from the 17 kD antigen gene of

Rickettsia using Primer-1 and Primer-2 (Webb et al. 1990), the bacterial 16S rRNA

gene of Anaplasma and Ehrlichia using the EC12A and HE3 primers (Reeves et

al. 2006a), and the gltA gene of Bartonella using the BhCS.781 and BHCS.1137

primers (Norman et al. 1995). In addition, we amplified the 16S rRNA gene

from selected samples with the RickF1 and RickR4 primers described by Reeves

(2005). PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 4% agarose gels and

visualized under ultraviolet light with ethidium bromide. Products were purified

with a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California). Sequencing

reactions were performed with a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit

(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California) using PCR primers, and excess dye

was removed by ethanol precipitation. Sequences were determined using an ABI

3700 capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California), aligned

and assembled with Chromas Lite 2.01 (Technelysium, Australia) and ClustalW

(Kyoto University Bioinformatics Center, Japan), and compared to sequences in

GenBank using the BLAST 2.0 program (NCBI, Bethesda, Maryland).

Voucher specimens for the ectoparasites collected were deposited in the Geor- gia Southern University Parasite Collection or the U.S. National Tick Collection. No

DNA sequences were deposited in GenBank, because there were no novel genotypes.

Results

We collected 13 species of blood-feeding or ectoparasitic arthropods (Table

1). The majority of the specimens were collected on domestic animals. Some of

these are unlikely to be vectors of either human or veterinary diseases. Rickett- sial and protozoan pathogens were detected in eight arthropods (Table 1). These

pathogens included Anaplasma platys, Anaplasma marginale, Coxiella burnetii,

Babesia canis vogeli, and Hepatozoon canis. Coxiella burnetii is the agent of Q

fever, a potentially significant disease in humans and animals. The other pathogens

were primarily veterinary.

Abstract—Modern surveys of ectoparasites and potential vector-borne

pathogens in the Republic of the Marshall Islands and Wake Island are

poorly documented. We report on field surveys of ectoparasites from

2010 with collections from dogs, cats, and rats. Five ectoparasites were

identified: the cat flea Ctenocephalides felis, a sucking louse Hoplopleura

pacifica, the mites Laelaps nuttalli and Radfordia ensifera, and the brown

dog tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus. Ectoparasites were screened for rick- ettsial pathogens. DNA from Anaplasma platys, a Coxiella symbiont of

Rhipicephalus sanguineus, and a Rickettsia sp. were identified by PCR

and DNA sequencing from ticks and fleas on Kwajalein Atoll. An uniden- tified spotted fever group Rickettsia was detected in a pool of Laelaps

nuttalli and Hoplopleura pacifica from Wake Island. The records of

Hoplopleura pacifica, Laelaps nuttalli, and Radfordia ensifera and the

pathogens are new for Kwajalein Atoll and Wake Island.

Introduction

Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands houses the U.S. Army

Kwajalein Atoll/Regan Test Site, which is inhabited by over 1,000 civilians, con- tractors, active duty military personnel and their families. Kwajalein Atoll has been

occupied by the US military since 1944. Kwajalein Island, the largest island in the

atoll, measures over 3.1 km2

with an average elevation of 1.8 m above sea level. It

is tropical, situated near the equator at 8o43' N, 167o43' E, and receives over 25 cm

of rain a year. Wake Island is an atoll and part of the unincorporated territories of

the USA. Wake Island is located further north at approximately 19o18'N, 166o38'

E. The island is over 3.3 km2

with a similar elevation to that of Kwajalein. There

are no native human populations on Wake Island but up to several hundred military

affiliated personnel work on the island. There is no natural standing or free flowing

fresh water on either atoll.

Surveys of vectors of human and animals diseases were conducted throughout

the Pacific after World War II, but very little continued research has been focused

on the smaller islands or island nations of the Pacific. Vector-borne diseases

have emerged on several occasions on Kwajalein or the neighboring atolls of the

Republic of the Marshall Islands. For example, an outbreak of dengue on Kwaja- lein in 1974 spread throughout the Pacific (WHO 1975). The arthropod fauna of

Kwajalein Atoll was reviewed by Sugerman (1972, 1979). Medically significant

arthropods included three mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti (L.), Aedes marshallensis

Stone & Bohart, and Culex quinquefasciatus Say. In addition, the brown dog tick,

Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Latreille), and the cat flea, Ctenocepalides felis (Bou- ché), were reported from the atoll (Sugerman 1972). No other ectoparasites of

humans or animals were reported. A scorpion, Isometrus maculatus (De Geer),

was also reported from buildings on the island (Sugerman 1972). Wake Island has

historically been free of fleas and most biting arthropods. However, Ae. aegypti

was established on Wake Island (Rosen et al. 1948). There are no current reports

of biting arthropods or ectoparasites on Wake Island. Large populations of Rattus

spp. are known from Kwajalein Atoll and Wake Island (Spennemann 1997), but

their ectoparasites are largely undocumented.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a field survey of ectoparasites that are potential vectors of

pathogens of medical and veterinary importance on Kwajalein Atoll from 19 -

23 July 2010. In addition, we spoke with the veterinary clinic staff on Kwajalein

Atoll about historic records of parasites, pathogens, ticks, and fleas. Vector- borne pathogens and parasites were rarely documented at the clinic, but local

animals on Ebeye Island (Kwajalein Atoll) were suspected of harboring signifi- cant tick populations. A walking survey of Ebeye Island revealed numerous tick

infested local dogs. Ticks were removed from 2 local dogs with the owner’s

permission and stored in 95% ethanol. Adult fleas were collected from pets on

Roi Namur Island (Kwajalein Atoll) by the veterinary staff and shipped to our

laboratory.

Both Kwajalein Atoll and Wake Island have rodent infestations. Rats are

routinely trapped by pest control personnel. We examined a freshly killed rat

from the housing area on Kwajalein Island. The terminal 1 cm of the tail was

clipped off and stored in 95% ethanol. The remainder of the rat was vigorously

washed in 35% ethanol for approximately 1 min and carefully examined. All

ectoparasites visible on the rat or in the ethanol wash were collected and pre- served in 95% ethanol. In addition >100 rodents from Wake Island killed during

routine activities in June 2010 were examined for ectoparasites by the local envi- ronmental officer. All ectoparasites and the rodent tails from Wake Island were

preserved in RNAlater (Qiagen) and shipped to our laboratory for further study.

Arthropods were identified using keys for Micronesian species (Kohls 1957,

Hopkins 1961, Wilson 1967, 1972a,b) or compared to reference specimens. Rep- resentative voucher specimens of each species were submitted to the Georgia

Southern University Ectoparasite Collection, the US National Tick Collection,

or the arthropod collection at the Public Health Command Region - Pacific.

Nucleic acids were extracted from arthropods and rodents. Arthropods and

rat tails were washed prior to DNA extraction by rinsing in distilled water for 30

seconds. Total DNA was extracted with a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen,

Valencia, California) and resuspended in 10% tris-HCL. DNA was screened for

Anaplasma, Babesia, Bartonella, Coxiella burnetii, Ehrlichia, Hepatozoon canis,

and Rickettsia spp. using real time PCR protocols described by Loftis et al (2006a)

or Kledmanee et al. (2009). Positive samples were further characterized by tradi- tional PCR and DNA sequencing.

The 16S rRNA gene was amplified from Anaplasma/Ehrlichia positive sam- ples using the primer pairs EC12A and HE3 and RickF1 and RickR4 (Reeves

2005, Reeves et al. 2006). We amplified DNA from the 17 kD antigen gene of

samples positive for Rickettsia using Primer-1 and Primer-2 as described by Webb

et al. (1990) or by pairing Primer-1 and Primer-2 with the real time PCR primers

to amplify smaller fragments. Controls for each assay included distilled water as

a negative control and synthetic DNA oligonucleotides that corresponded to the

primers and probe but have unique sequences as a positive control. The synthetic

oligonucleotides can be differentiated from real agents by DNA sequencing.

PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 4% agarose gels and

visualized under ultraviolet light with ethidium bromide. Products were purified

with a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California). Sequencing

reactions were performed with a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit

(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California) using PCR primers, and excess dye

was removed by ethanol precipitation. Sequences were determined using an ABI

3700 capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California), aligned

and assembled with Chromas Lite 2.01 (Technelysium, Australia) and ClustalW

(Kyoto University Bioinformatics Center, Japan), and compared to sequences

in GenBank using the BLAST 2.0 program (NCBI, Bethesda, Maryland). DNA

sequences from the 16S rRNA gene of a novel Coxiella sp. were deposited in Gen- Bank (Accession # HQ116458) as was the 17kD antigenic gene sequence from a

Rickettsia from Wake Island (Accession # HQ322623).
