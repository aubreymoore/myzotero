Research in Support of the Guam Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle Eradication Project
Cypermethrin Applied to Coconut Palm Crowns as a Prophylactic Treatment for Prevention of
CRB Damage
Prepared by Aubrey Moore University of Guam Cooperative Extension Service November 5, 2013∗
After learning that some pest control operators on Guam are attempting to protect high value ornamental palms from CRB damage by spraying crowns with cypermethrin, we decided to test this method as a valid IPM tactic. We applied biweekly spray applications of cypermethrin to the crowns of 32 young coconut palms along the entrance road to the University of Guam Agricultural Experiment Station at Yigo, Guam. As a damage index, we counted how many of the youngest four fronds on each tree showed signs of CRB damage. The damage index fell from 4.00 to 0.62 during 5.5 months of treatment. Speay residue collects at the base of petioles which is the site at which CRB initiates bore holes. In daily inspections of the ground under each treated palm, we found 29 dead or dying CRB adults, indicating that they were knocked down prior to boring into the crowns.

1 Methods
A row of 32 young coconut palms planted along the entrance road to the University of Guam Agricultural Experiment Station in Yigo were sprayed with cypermetherin on a biweekly schedule (Table 2, Figure 1). These trees ranges from 8 to 20 feet in height. As an index of CRB damage, I count how many of the four youngest fronds had distinctive CRB damage. If a spear (an unopened frond) was present, this was considered to be the youngest frond. Damage assessments were performed at the start of the experiment on May 19, 2013 and on November 5, 2013. I checked for and collected daead or moribund CRB adults under each tree each morning.
2 Results and Discussion
All trees were very heavily damaged at the start of the experiment. All of the youngest four fronds on each tree bore signs of CRB damage (Table 1). Thus, the average damage index, on a scale of 0 to 4, was 4.000.

When the trees were observed 5.5 months later, the average damage index had dropped to 0.625. Eighteen of the 32 trees (56%) had none of their four newest fronds damaged and only one tree had all four new fronds damaged.
During the same 5.5 month period, 29 dead or dying beetles were collected beneath the treated trees.
This study was more of an emergency control operation than an experiment. Because we did not reserve untreated trees as an experimental control, we do not know if the reduced damage to new fromds is in response to the cypermethrin applications. However, this is probably the case, because we did observe mortality of adult beetles attacking the treated trees. Because cypermethrin has a quick knockdown eﬀect, as with most pyrethroids. It is likely that the beetles were intoxicated shrtly after arriving and before they were able to bore into the crown. It should be noted that when the canopy is sprayed, the liquid runs down the inside of the petioles and collects at the angle between the petioles and the trunk at the location were CRB initiate their bore holes.
