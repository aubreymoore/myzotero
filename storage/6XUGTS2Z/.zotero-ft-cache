ABSTRACT Dynastinae beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) are important due to their role in recycling plant material and promoting nutrient turnover. However, some species are phytophagous and can attack crop plants, thus becoming pests. Here, we provide information on the biology and behavior of the rhinoceros beetle Enema pan (F.) (Oryctini), an abundant species in the area of Cerrado-Pantanal ecotone, Aquidauana, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Adults were collected with a light trap deployed daily from January 2006 to December 2007 in the experimental farm of the Universidade Estadual de Mato Grosso do Sul (Aquidauana campus). Adults were maintained in plastic containers and observations were made daily. Temporal distribution of adults of E. pan occurred in September and October (2006) and from October to December (2007). Flight started at 1930 hours and ended at 2330 hours. Twenty-four eggs (3.28 mm in length by 2.32 mm in width) with a whitish color were ovipositioned directly in to the soil. Adult longevity averaged 22.0 d in the laboratory conditions. Cephalic horn length, body length, and width of E. pan males are greater than those of females. The weight of adults of both sexes was similar. Cephalic horn length of the males of E. pan was positively correlated with his body size. Mating occurred between 0800 and 1030 hours and lasted on average 18.1 min in the laboratory. Several Þghts among males and other behaviors involving males and females were observed and are reported.

Dynastinae beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) are distributed throughout the world and are most diverse in the tropics, especially in the Neotropics (Ratcliffe 2003, Gasca-A´ lvarez and Amat-Garcõ´a 2010). Adults range in size from 4 to 160 mm (Ratcliffe 2003), and some of the largest insects on Earth [e.g., Dynastes hercules (L.); Dynastini] fall into this subfamily. Males in some species posses prominent and often spectacular horns on the head and/or thorax, which together with their large size, have given rise to such popular names for them as “elephant,” “Hercules,” “rhinoceros,” and “unicorn” beetles (Ratcliffe 2003).
Oryctini (Scarabaeidae: Dynastinae) is one of the most diversity tribes because of the number of species, its worldwide distribution, and the considerable areas of endemism in Central and South America (Mizi-

numa 1999). It comprises 26 genera and 230 species
worldwide, with more than half of the genera and
species occur in the Neotropical region (Ratcliffe and
Cave 2006). Adults are active at night and often are
attracted by light sources. During the day, they seek
refuge and remain hidden. Some species feed on de-
caying plant matter or rotten fruit, whereas others bore into the stems of plants, such as sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) and palm trees (Ratcliffe 2003). Larvae
develop in soil, plant debris accumulations, within the
stems of plants, within ant hills or in rotting tree trunks
and roots (Moro´ n 1985, Ratcliffe 2003). Some species are pests of plants of economic interest, principally
attacking the roots and stems of palm trees (Bodkin
1919, Cockerell 1946, Lourenc¸ a˜o et al. 1999) and sugarcane (Ratcliffe 2003).
Enema Hope (Dynastinae: Oryctini) includes Enema endymion Chevrolat, which is distributed from Mexico to Bolivia and Brazil and Enema pan (F.),
which occurs in tropical Central and South America
(Ratcliffe 2003, Gasca et al. 2008). Endro¨ di (1976, 1985) reported four morphotypes described as sub-
species based on differences in the male pronotal and head horns: Enema pan aeneas (Kirby), Enema pan chorinaeum (F.), Enema pan enema (F.), and Enema pan pan (F.). These morphotypes are considered synonyms of E. pan and represent variation within a single
species (Ratcliffe 2003, Gasca et al. 2008). Despite

their large size and occasional local abundance, little is known on the life history of these species (Ratcliffe 2003). Adults are nocturnal and attracted to light, and the larvae probably feed on humus in the soil (Ratcliffe 2003). E. pan seems to be restricted to forested areas, whereas E. endymion has been found both in forested and secondary scrub areas, often in very large numbers (Ratcliffe 2003).
In Brazil, few studies have been developed with the objective of studying the biology, behavior and/or diversity of Dynastinae beetles. The most recent work focuses on biological aspects of Cyclocephala verticalis Burmeister (Cyclocephalini), an abundant species in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, which can be encountered in crops, pasturelands, and native palms (Puker et al. 2009; Rodrigues et al. 2010a, 2011). Andreazze (2001), Andreazze and Fonseca (1998), and Andreazze and Motta (2002) reported Dynastinae diversity in some localities of the state of Amazonas, and Gasca et al. (2008) provided a synopsis of Oryctini of the Brazilian Amazon forest. Some papers dealing with economic aspects of Dynastinae in Brazil were published for Diloboderus abderus (Sturm) (Pentodontini) and species of Strategus Hope (Oryctini). The former has signiÞcant importance and is commonly found causing damage and losses in crops during the winter and early spring in some areas of the state of Rio Grande do Sul (Silva and Costa 2002). There are some reports found in literature dealing with biology and behavior (Silva and Loeck 1996, Morelli 1997), biometrics (Silva and Gru¨ tzmacher 1996), level of economic damage (Silva and Costa 1998), and pest control (Silva 1997, 2000; Silva and Boss 2002). Interaction of the species Strategus with palms (Arecaceae) was evaluated by Lourenc¸ a˜ o et al. (1999).
Motivated by the little knowledge on diversity and biology of Dynastinae occurring in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul (Brazil), studies were initiated to gather information on the species encountered in the Cerrado-Pantanal ecotone. The Brazilian Cerrado is a complex mosaic of native vegetation, including grassland, savanna and forest (Oliveira and Marquis 2002). The Pantanal is a large wetland of Ϸ160,000 km2 in the center of the South American continent with average elevation of 100 m and is located in Brazil (states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul), Paraguay, and eastern Bolivia (Alho et al. 1988). In a transition area between these ecosystems a great abundance of the rhinoceros beetle E. pan is found all years both in rural areas (e.g., crops, patches of Brazilian savanna and pasturelands) and in the city of Aquidauana (Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil) at illuminated areas. In this work we provide information on the biology and behavior of this beetle.
Materials and Methods
This study was developed at the Universidade Estadual de Mato Grosso do Sul (UEMS) (Aquidauana campus), in Aquidauana, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil,

Temporal Distribution and Time Flight. Adults of E. pan were collected with a light trap model Luiz de Queiroz (Gallo et al. 2002) deployed daily from January 2006 until December 2007. The trap used a 20 watt ßuorescent lamp operated from 1800 to 0600 hours and was placed 1 m above the soil between crops and pasturelands at the experimental farm of the UEMS. This type of trap is considered efÞcient for collecting Scarabaeidae, being that several species are attracted to light, including E. pan (Ratcliffe 2003, Gasca et al. 2008). Flight time of this beetle was studied checking the light trap every 30 min from 1800 to 0600 hours from 14 to 23 October 2007 (methods of Stone 1986).
Biological and Behavioral Aspects. Captured adults were Þrst taken to the laboratory where they were quantiÞed and sexed (females, smoothed prothoracic horns; Fig. 1A and B). Sixty-two females were dissected to determine the stage of reproductive period (methods of Crocker et al. 1999). To study the female reproductive system of E. pan, specimens were boiled for Ϸ3 min and then the abdomen was detached and placed in a KOHÐwater solution for 2Ð3 d before the terminalia were ready to be removed. Terminalia were

Biological observations were made of 90 couples. Sixty couples were kept in 10 large plastic containers (55 by 35 by 20 cm) (six couples per container) and 30 couples in 30 smaller plastic containers (30 by 19 by 12 cm) (one couple per container). Containers were Þlled with soil and rotting wood and were covered with a cloth. Sprouts of Brachiaria decumbens Stapf “Basilisk” (Poaceae) were planted in each container. Each container was checked daily for collection of eggs (which were counted), behavioral observations, and removal of dead insects. Ripe native palm fruits [Acrocomia aculeata (Jacq.) Lodd. ex Mart.] and decomposing mango (Mangifera indica L.) (Anacardiaceae) were offered ad libitum to adults of E. pan. Fruit from this palm species were offered based on previous observations in the laboratory and mango because of reports made by Pardo-Locarno et al. (2006).
One hundred and seventy dead adults were pinned, labeled, and dried at 60 Ϯ 1ЊC during 48 h. Specimens were then weighed and measured (body length, cephalic horn length and prothorax width of males and females) (modiÞed method from Silva and Gru¨ tzmacher 1996).
Additional information on the behavior of E. pan was obtained by inspection of the beetles that were attracted by Þve lighted areas of the UEMS experimental farm during the period in which their ßight time was studied (see above).
Statistical Analyses. Previously, to verify whether there was a difference between times of ßight for E. pan, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed. The data did not show homogeneity of variance and normal distribution; thus, a KruskalÐWallis (KW) test was used for analysis. The correlation of monthly precipitation and average monthly temperature with the number of individuals was done using the Spearman correlation (R). Meteorological data were obtained from the weather station at the UEMS (Aquidauana, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil) 300 m from the light trap. Biometric data were submitted to the ANOVA analyses using the dimensions or weight as the response variable and sex of the individuals as the explanatory variable (P Ͻ 0.05). A Spearman correlation analysis (R) was performed between the length of male head ornaments with their body size (length and width of the body).
Identiﬁcation and Deposit of Voucher Specimens. Specimens were identiÞed by Dr. Sergio Ide and vouchers were deposited in the “Colec¸ a˜o Entomolo´ gica Adolph Hempel” from the Instituto Biolo´ gico (IBSP, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil) and the UEMS.

Results
In 2006 ßight activity occurred between September
and October. One hundred and Þfty-Þve individuals
were collected, 93 in September and 62 in October. In
2007, the ßight activity initiated in October and ended
in December. Sixty-Þve adults were collected in Oc-
tober and another 46 in November, but only one in December. Populational ßuctuation of E. pan was not
correlated with precipitation and temperature of the
area where this study was conducted (2006, precipitation: R ϭ 0.0397, P Ͼ 0.05; temperature: R ϭ Ϫ0.0191, P Ͼ 0.05; 2007, precipitation: R ϭ 0.1438, P Ͼ 0.05; temperature: R ϭ 0.3655, P Ͼ 0.05). Adults were observed in ßight from 1930 to 2330 hours, with greatest activity from 1930 to 2030 hours (KW test: KW ϭ 22.5364; P Ͻ 0.01) (Fig. 2).
The sex ratio was roughly 2:1; 267 specimens (174
females and 93 males) were collected during the 2 yr.
In dissected females, the mean number of eggs in 2006
was 20.1 in September and 22.1 in October. In 2007,
females presented mean egg counts of 14.8 in October
and 21.2 in November (Table 1). The terminalia and
reproductive tract have sclerotized, narrow parap-
rocts over the anal opening (Fig. 3 and 9); proctiger
(Figs. 4 and 5, 9) divided in two longitudinal narrow
plates and the apical ovipositor; gonocoxites (Fig. 3)
lateral to genital opening (Fig. 6) with large, pubes-
cent apex (Fig. 6); large and sacular bursa copulatrix
(Fig. 7 and 8); elongated spermatheca and spherical
accessory glands (Figs. 7 and 8). In the laboratory, adults of E. pan fed on ripe palm
and mango fruit. When mango was offered, the adults
of dug tunnels just below the fruit. Tunnels averaged 12.0 cm in depth (range, 10.0 Ð14.0 cm; n ϭ 7) and 2.5 cm in diameter (range, 2.0 Ð3.0 cm; n ϭ 7). Twentyfour eggs (n ϭ 3 females) were found in the recipients where the adults were maintained. Eggs are white and
have average dimensions of 3.28 mm in length by 2.32 mm in width (n ϭ 24). After 6 d, just one egg hatched. The Þrst-instar larva survived only 9 d and the width
of the head capsule was 3.2 mm.
Mean longevity of adults was 22.0 d in the laboratory. The average longevity for females (n ϭ 112) was 23.0 d (range, 2.0 Ð95.0) and 19.5 d (range, 2.0 Ð35.0) for males (n ϭ 93). Males of E. pan measure, on average, 39.3 mm in length and 20.1 mm in width.
These dimensions are signiÞcantly different from
those of the females, which measured on average 38.4 mm in length and 19.1 mm in width (length: F1,168 ϭ 7.5002; P ϭ 0.007; width: F1,168 ϭ 17.8919; P Ͻ 0.001) (Table 2). Mean length of the head horn in males was
16.0 mm, which is signiÞcantly different from that of females (7.0 mm) (F1,168 ϭ 682.6504; P Ͻ 0.001) (Table 2). There were no signiÞcant differences in weight
between males and females (1,362.2 and 1,331.4 mg, respectively) (F1,168 ϭ 0.5539; P Ͼ 0.05) (Table 2). Length of the horn of E. pan males was positively correlated with their body size (length: R ϭ 0.2990, P ϭ 0.007, width: R ϭ 0.5241, P Ͻ 0.0001), i.e., the longer and wider the male, the larger his cephalic
horn.

In the laboratory, seven matings were observed
occurring between 0800 and 1030 hours and lasted an
average of 18.1 min (range, 8.0 Ð27.0). Calling behavior
or pheromone release was not observed before cop-
ulation. The male walked toward the female, which
remained immobile, mounted her and copulation commenced. We observed that some males (n ϭ 3) stayed on top of females for Ϸ15 min (range, 11Ð19) after copulation ended. Behavioral aspects of E. pan were observed in the Þeld. Occasionally (n ϭ 7) males held females between the thoracic and head horns for Ϸ11.1 min on average (range, 1.2Ð75.0), after which the females were released (Fig. 10A and B). Females
held by males usually produced a sound that would attract other males (n ϭ 14). Attracted males used their horned against the male holding the female and
also walked on the couple. It was expected that cop-
ulation occurred just after the female was released, but during the time that this was observed (n ϭ 5) copulation did not occur. When males were observed next to other males (n ϭ 10), they moved their head horn up and down, trying to hold each other. Males who

managed to hold other males (n ϭ 5) would walk with the other upheld for 38 cm on average (range, 20 Ð70 cm). The males being held attempted to free themselves and stridulated.
Discussion
In this study, we recorded the presence of E. pan in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul (Cerrado-Pantanel ecotone), amplifying the understanding of its geographical distribution (see distribution of E. pan in Brazil in Moro´ n 2004 and Gasca et al. 2008). Currently, little is known in regards to the life history of E. pan. Here, we monitored the daily ßight activity of these rhinoceros beetles during 2 yr. It was veriÞed that the beetles were encountered in ßight during a short period of the year (SeptemberÐ December considering the 2 yr of the studies). In Mexico, adults of E. pan were captured with light traps in May (Moro´ n 1979) and August (CarrilloRuiz and Moro´ n 2003). In countries such as Costa Rica and Panama, the temporal distribution of E. pan

occurs between April and September (Ratcliffe 2003). Adults of E. pan may be encountered during
practically the entire year in the Brazilian Amazon
(Gasca et al. 2008). Therefore, seasonal variation of

the species in different regions is probably related to the adaptation of the populations to the different biotic factors, abiotic factors, or both of each location.

In this study, no relationship was encountered between the abiotic factors (precipitation and temperature) and population ßuctuation of E. pan adults, probably for a short temporal distribution of insects and the rainfall highly distributed throughout the year (Fig. 11A and B). Although not statistically proven by the correlation analysis, we believe there is a soil moisture threshold that stimulates and/or facilitating the emergence of the adults of E. pan. In 2006, the Þrst adults of E. pan were captured only in mid-September, after a yearly precipitation accumulation of 673 mm (Fig. 11A). In the following year, there was no rainfall in September and adults of E. pan were not collected. Only in the beginning of October and after accumulation of 679.9 mm of rainfall that the Þrst adult of E. pan was captured in the light trap (Fig. 11B). In Costa Rica and Panama, adults of E. endymion are abundantly attracted by light traps, especially during the beginning of the rainy period (Ratcliffe 2003). This relationship has been observed for other Dynastinae and Rutelinae beetles, as for example in Cyclocephala signaticollis Burmeister (Cyclocephalini) (Mondino et al. 1997) and Leucothyreus dorsalis Blanchard (Geniatini) (Rodrigues et al. 2010b).
The peak of greatest ßight activity lasted roughly 1 h (1930 Ð2030 hours), and this is probably related with

decreasing luminosity, as well as a decrease in temperature and possibly increase in soil moisture content, which may function to stimulate ßight activity. The time of ßight activity of other Oricyni has not yet been effectively studied, but it is known that in Mexico, adults of E. pan remain below the soil during the day and emerge in large number at dusk (Moro´ n 1979). Individuals of Xyloryctes thestalus Bates and Xyloryctes ensifer Bates (Orictyni) are captured with light traps with greatest incidence between 2000 and 2100 hours for the Þrst species and between 2000 and 2200 hours for the second species (Moro´ n 1981). In Colombia, adults of Podischnus agenor (Olivier) (Oryctni) have frequently been observed ßying in lighted areas between 2000 and 0500 hours, and individuals of Heterogomphus dilaticollis Burmeister (Oryctni) have been observed in ßight between 1830 and 0500 hours (Neita and Orozco 2009).
During the 2 yr (2006 and 2007) in which adults of E. pan were collected, some females were selected to verify the presence of eggs during the ßight period. Females that were captured by the light trap possessed developing eggs; therefore, it can inferred that the beetles exit the soil sexually mature. To better understand the reproduction of this rhinoceros beetle species, the female reproductive organs were analyzed, helping to expand knowledge on morphology of the female reproductive system in Dynastinae beetles.
Adults were conÞned to the plastic containers and fed ripe palm and decomposing mango fruit. Adults of E. pan dig tunnels below the mango fruits. In nature,

these tunnels are probably constructed for shelter, to store the aliment for its progenies, or both (e.g., Knaus 1924). Other species of Oryctini also produce galleries similarly to E. pan, including for example, adults of Coelosis biloba (L.) (Oryctini) that dig tunnels for refuge during the day and are night active only (Pardo-Locarno et al. 2006); adults of X. thestalus (Oryctini) were observed both in the Þeld and in the laboratory digging individual galleries 20 Ð25 cm in depth where they remained during the day (Moro´ n and Zaragoza 1976); and larvae of Strategus cessus Leconte (Oryctini) may be encountered feeding within the tunnels (40 cm in depth) constructed by the adults (Moro´ n and Deloya 1991). Males of H. dilaticollis, when sexually mature, produce galleries in the soil of up to 60 cm deep; however, mating occurs outside the tunnels (Neita and Orozco 2009).
Eggs were ovipositioned individually in the soil, but only one hatched. The small number of eggs and females ovipositing is believed to be due to laboratory conditions, especially the volume of soil present in the containers and the food offered that may be inadequate to stimulate egg laying. The low viability of eggs may be caused by a series of factors related to conÞnement of the adults (e.g., small space for ßying, low number of matings, unavailability of food suitable for the progeny). The size and characteristics of the eggs of E. pan that were found in this study were similar to other Oryctini, Strategus mormon Burmeister (Knaus 1916).
Average longevity of E. pan males and females is little Ͼ20 d in laboratory conditions. However, one female remained alive for 3 mo in the laboratory. We observed that the adults fed on palm and mango fruit, different from C. biloba, which can survive for weeks in the laboratory without feeding (Pardo-Locarno et al. 2006).
Specimens of E. pan encountered in Panama (Ϸ 47 mm in length by 28.2 mm in width) (Ratcliffe 2003) and in the Brazilian Amazon (males, 45.0 Ð58.5 mm in length by 23.5Ð31.6 mm in width) (Gasca et al. 2008) are notably larger than those encountered in the Brazilian Cerrado-Pantanal ecotone. The different food source may have contributed to the difference in size among adults. Males from in the Brazilian Amazon, Costa Rica, and Panama are larger than females (Ratcliffe 2003, Gasca et al. 2008), a pattern similar to that encountered in the current study. As was observed in E. pan, males of D. abderus are signiÞcantly larger than females, but weight was similar in both sexes (Silva and Gru¨ tzmacher 1996).
In the laboratory, behavioral activity involved before, during, and after mating was observed (see Results). Adults were observed mating during the morning in the laboratory, but we cannot be sure that this occurs in nature. In the Þeld, this probably occurs with the formation of couples at night and later adults may dig nests to perform intercourse, perhaps at day or night. Several studies report information on the construction of nests and perhaps this is extremely important to allow that adults can mate. For E. pan, this need be studied in-depth in the Þeld. It is known, for

example, that mating of H. dilaticollis (Neita and Orozco 2009) frequently occurs at the entrance of the galleries that are dug in the soil. Mating of Strategus aloeus (L.) (Oryctini) (ϭStrategus julianus; see the revision of Ratcliffe 1976) seems to occur spontaneously, without prior courting and lasting between 5 and 15 min (Moro´ n 1976), as was observed here in E. pan.
We found that males had larger cephalic horn than females and also possessed prothoracic horns (Fig. 1). During this study, through observations performed in the Þeld, we observed the fascinating behavior of males to capture and carry other males and females using their horns. Similarly to others Dynastinae (see Beebe 1944), we believe that the signiÞcant relationship between body size of males of E. pan and its head ornament may be possibly related to sexual selection and the reproductive success of males. Those with larger horns probably have higher reproductive success because they can carry females, thus decreasing sexual competition. Moreover, males with smaller body and horn sizes probably rely on a different strategy to ensure his partner. Besides this function of transporting the female and/or apparatus for defense against other males, the horns can play an important role in the excavation of nests for the couple. Similarly, adult males of S. aloeus use their horns in combat with other males (Moro´ n 1976). Battles between males of S. aloeus in defense of feeding and/or reproduction territories may last up to 3 h, suggesting that this conduct is involved with sexual selection (Moro´ n 1976). We think that to produce horns is expensive for insects and small ornaments cephalic were observed in females of E. pan. However, the use of this apparatus was not observed both in laboratory conditions and Þeld.
When males carry the females or when Þghting with other males, the adults emit sounds (males and females), but little is known on its origin and/or function. We suspect that the tentative release of females held by males is a result of the stridulatory sounds produced by the females. Stridulation by held males did not attract other males or promote release. When studying other Dynastinae, Forrest et al. (1997) found auditory organs behind the head of Euetheola humilis Burmeister (Pentodontini); they reported that the same type of structure can be present in species of Cyclocephala Dejean, Dyscinetus Harold (Cyclocephalini), and Oxygrylius Casey (Pentodontini). Moro´ n and Zaragoza (1976) reported the presence of stridulatory organs located in the upper leg and cavities of this region in adults of X. thestalus (in males and females). These authors suggest that the beetles use this mechanism to attract the opposite sex, and may be used by males to intimidate other males; combat between males is probably due to possession of females.
However, we believe that the sound emitted by the female of E. pan may be a mating strategy, as it attracts other males. As disputes typically occur, it is likely that the largest male intimidates its opponents and is the male selected for mating. Evolutionary this strategy of the female may be interesting, because their offspring

may possess large horns. The genetic potential and the quality and quantity of food ingested during the larval stage also certainly inßuence the morphology of adults.
In conclusion, we provide interesting information on the biology and behavior of E. pan, but in general, little is still known on the life history of other Neotropical Dynastinae. This is even more pronounced for Brazilian species that inhabit the Cerrado and Pantanal ecosystems for which the understanding of biology, diversity, and ecology of these beetles is very limited. Life history of E. pan and especially the actual role of the cephalic horns of males in selection and sexual conßict must be better evaluated in future studies.
