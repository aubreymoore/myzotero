Summary. We adapted a four-arm olfactometer (55 × 55 × 5.5 cm) for bioassays of large insects and its usefulness was evaluated by testing the responses of three beetles, the palm weevil Rhynchophorus palmarum (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidea) and two Dynast scarabs Strategus aloeus (L.) and Oryctes rhinoceros (L.) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) to plant odours and aggregation pheromones. This olfactometer was coupled to a volatile delivery system dispensing highly volatile semiochemicals at constant concentrations. We materialized airflows in the olfactometer by discolouring sensitive papers with acid vapours under various conditions (air straighten by stainless steel grids in inputs and output, 500 ml/min per arm) to visualize air turbulence and to test air-tightness. The volatile delivery system can be used to mix and dispense a broad range of concentrations of semiochemicals in air from diluted aqueous solutions. It was calibrated by measuring the release of the pheromone using solid phase-microextraction (SPME). Dose-response curves to synthetic pheromone were obtained for O. rhinoceros of both sexes. Coupling the volatile delivery system to the fourarm olfactometer provided a system with which the responses of R. palmarum and S. aloeus to their synthetic aggregation pheromones and to natural plant volatiles could be readily observed and studied.

Introduction
Many large tropical insects, such as palm beetles, are major pests (e.g. Bedford 1980). As efficient control methods are lacking, chemical ecology studies of some species aim to develop olfactory trapping, particularly using pheromones. Chemical communication appears highly developed in palm beetles as in most Coleoptera. Various attractive pheromones and plant odours have been identified and evaluated in the field (Giblin-Davis et al. 1996; Hardie & Minks 1999;

Rochat et al. 2000, 2002, 2004). Successful mass trapping using synthetic pheromones and plant co-attractants has been reported for Rhynchophorus spp., Oryctes spp. and Scapanes autralis (Abraham et al. 2000; Chung 1997; Oehlschlager et al. 1992, 1995, 2002). For most of these species, the need to add plant material to synergize pheromones has limited implementation of olfactory trapping on a large scale. Often, mass trapping did not reduce damage in spite of important captures of pests. For example, this technique could not control Rhynchophorus ferrugineus invasions in the Middle East (Ollivier and Rochat, 2003).
These limits and failures could be due in part to lack of data concerning variability of olfactive responses of palm beetles and factors that could influence responses: age, sex, density, climatic conditions … None of these species have been the subject of detailed laboratory experiments measuring the effect of these factors on their behavioural responses to semiochemicals active in mass trapping.
So far, two constraining factors have limited the study of the behaviour of palm beetles in the laboratory: first, the very large size of these insects compared to most insect pests studied previously. And second, the difficulty to deliver the highly volatile semiochemicals they respond to (typically C2 to C10 molecules, e.g. ethanol, ethyl acetate, and 2-butanone: pheromone component of Strategus aloeus; Rochat et al. 2000a, b), at concentrations maintained constant over time using simple classical dispensers such as rubber septa, filter papers or glass capillaries (Baker and Cardé 1984).
We developed a tool to study, under laboratory conditions, behavioural responses to highly volatile semiochemicals, for example, the synergistic responses of palm weevils to plant odours and pheromones (Saïd et al. 2005), and factors affecting the responsiveness of beetles to their pheromones. Among the devices described in the literature (Baker & Lin 1984; Harari et al. 1994; Visser 1976), the four-arm olfactometer initially developed for small insects such as aphids, hymenopteran parasitoids or mites (Kaiser et al. 1989; Le Conte et al. 1989; Pettersson 1970; Vet et al. 1983) offered a design a priori favourable for studying synergistic responses to semiochemicals in a choice situation and has several advantages: it presents a dynamic system, with permanent reverse-choice possibilities and high statistical power (Kaiser et al. 1993; Vet et al. 1983).

addition, it retains its properties when enlarged to study 1-2 cm long insects such as honeybees (Bakchine-Huber et al. 1992; Pham-Delegue et al. 1991, 1993) or West Indies sugarcane weevils (Ramirez-Lucas et al. 1996). Nevertheless, enlarging an olfactometer to a size adapted to stocky palm beetles generated many difficulties and required a new longer set up. In addition, to precisely control volatile delivery to insects, we used the volatile delivery system described by Bartelt and Zilkowski (1998). As the volatile delivery system and the four-arm olfactometer are two dynamic systems with opposite air flow controls (air respectively blown or drawn), the coupled system had to be adapted. Here, we investigated its physical functioning and biological relevance for the American palm weevil, Rhynchophorus palmarum and the dynast beetle, Strategus aloeus. The suitability of the olfactometer, without volatile delivery system, was evaluated for another dynast beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros.

Materials and methods
Insects
The palm weevil R. palmarum came from Colombia and French Guyana, the dynast scarabs S. aloeus and O. rhinoceros came from Colombia and Indonesia, respectively. The palm weevil is 40- to 45-mm long, rather flat, and the scarabs are 50- to 70-mm long and very stout, especially the major males. We tested field-collected insects that had been brought subsequently to France. Males and females were kept separately on sugarcane under tropical conditions (23-28 °C; R.H.: 75-90 %; L13:D11). Ten to 15 days conditioning to their new photoperiod were necessary to eliminate any physiological disturbance due to the time lag. One day before tests, insects were isolated in small boxes without food. Half an hour before tests, subjects were transferred to the bioassay room and allowed to acclimate for at least 30 min.

Physical set-up
Olfactometer
The four-arm olfactometer (Laucoin s.a., Thoiry, France) had the same shape as the one described by Pettersson (1970; in Vet 1983), but was enlarged (55 × 55 × 5.5 cm) (Fig. 1). Due to its size, we had to integrate specific elements to minimize the turbulence of airflows; plastic clamps (cl) were added to improve the air-tightness in the four corners of the olfactometer. Either stainless steel (5-mm thick porous sheet; Syntech, Hilversum, the Netherlands) or plastic (Mamison, Scamark, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France) grids (gd) were used to create laminar airflows at the inputs (∅ = 20 mm) and the output (∅ = 60 mm).
The olfactometer was made of opaque high density polyethylene (HDPE) with a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) transparent lid. It consisted in three parts: - the base with the air output, - the intermediate part, which delimited the walking chamber (3-cm high, 1-l volume) with the four air inputs, and - the lid (1-cm thick) with a 9-cm circular central opening to introduce insects. Two Neoprene® rings and four large thumb screws ensure the tightness between the three parts.
A diaphragm pump (Cole Parmer, U.S.A.) was used to draw air at constant flow rates. Four flow-meters (fm; Brooks, U.S.A.) controlled airflows into the olfactometer. We used the same constant flow rates in all four arms. Air was brought to the olfactometer through Tygon® 2275 plastic tubes (ty; ID = 10 mm) that had high chemical inertia and good flexibility.
Initially we reproduced Vet et al.’s (1983) protocol to check air-tightness of the device and turbulence of airflows in the central zone of the exposure chamber. The pump sucked white ammonium

CHEMOECOLOGY
chloride smoke (HCl reacting with NH4OH) onto a dark paper (Ecokraft; Maildor, France) stuck on the floor of the olfactometer chamber. However, as the ammonium chloride particles rapidly blocked the air inputs and stuck onto the lid, observation of the flows was impossible. Nevertheless, the acid vapours had a discolouring effect on the paper. Therefore, we used this acid property. Two opposite arms were connected to the acid flasks and ventilated for 5 min, and this induced clear discolouration. Five configurations (A: no grids; B, C: plastic grids either in the air inputs or output; D: plastic grids in both air inputs and output; and E: stainless steel grids in both air inputs and output), were tested for four different airflow rates (150, 250, 500 and 1000 ml/min per arm). Each configuration was evaluated four times for each flow rate.
The acidic prints on paper were recorded with a Tri CDD JVC KY camera equipped with a macro-photographic objective (Microcoputer-Nikkor 60 mm F: 2.8). The camera was connected to a microcomputer (Apple Macintosh Quadra 650) via a digitisation card (RGB Image Grabber 24). The images were processed either with Photoshop v. 4.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., U.S.A.) or Picture Publisher V. 6.0 (Micrografx Inc., U.S.A.) software.
Volatile delivery system
Our volatile delivery system (Fig. 1) was an adaptation of Bartelt and Zilkowski’s (1998) model. Our system contained the same elements except that we used a capillary Teflon® tube (restrictor tube; ID = 0.5 mm, L = 5 cm) instead of a stainless steel needle to create the back pressure read on the manometer (ma). The odour source was a gently ventilated (9 ml/min) silanised glass vial (Sou: 250 ml; Fig 1) filled with 100 ml of a diluted aqueous solution of a volatile organic compound (VOC). Part of the VOC evaporated until equilibrium between head space concentration and aqueous concentration was reached (Henry’s law; Betterton 1992). Mass delivery rate of the VOC was then constant. The percentage of the mass delivery rate (10-100 %) oriented to the mixture zone was regulated by a precision valve (V1); the remainder was evacuated through a low vacuum (Vac). The percentage of the mass delivery rate oriented to the mixture zone was correlated to the manometric difference indicated by the manometer (ma). Delivery rate of air flows from the mixture zone to the olfactometer could be regulated by eliminating part of the air flow through a vacuum (Vac) using an On/Off valve (V2). Several independent sources can be connected to the mixture zone (Fig. 1).
We followed Bartelt and Zilkowski’s (1998) procedure to set up the volatile delivery system. This consisted in determining: first, the constant that governed the equilibrium of the pheromone source (Henry’s constant; Bartelt 1997); second, the concentration delivered in the air at the device output and, third, the relationships between these values and the associated manometric differences obtained by adjusting valves V1 (Fig. 1).
Analytical chemistry
Solid phase microextration (SPME) was used to sample the VOCs in gaseous phase from the source. An SPME fibre was inserted into the tube carrying the airflow from the flask (Fig. 1: S1) and exposed to the VOC-laden air for 30 min. This duration was sufficient to obtain equilibration. The fibre coating was 100 µm PDMS (Supelco, Bellefonte, USA). The affinity constants of the fibre for the VOCs were determined according to Bartelt (1997). FID response factors of the chromatograph to the VOC were established from serial dilutions. Therefore, concentrations of VOC in the airflow coming from an odour source (ng/ml) were calculated directly from the GC peak area. These concentrations and the volumetric airflow rates (9 ml/min) gave the mass delivery rates of the VOC (ng/sec).
We used the male aggregation pheromone of the palm weevil Rhynchophorus palmarum to calibrate our volatile delivery system (see Bioassay section for chemical characteristics). SPME samples were analysed with a Varian Star 3400 Cx gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a WCOT

CPSil8-CB column (25 m × 0.32 mm (ID) × 0.4 µm d.f.). To calibrate the pheromone of R. palmarum, the column was operated from 50 °C (for 1 min) to 70 °C at 20 °C/min (plateau for 5 min), then to 250 °C (maintained finally for 3.5 min) at 8 °C/min. The injector and detector were heated at 230 and 260 °C, respectively. To calibrate the pheromone of S. aloeus, the column was operated from 15 °C (for 1 min) to 40 °C at 10 °C/min (plateau for 1 min), then to 80 °C at 5 °C/min (plateau for 1 min) and to 240 °C (maintained finally for 1.5 min) at 20°C/min. The injector and detector were heated as previously.
Olfactometer bioassays
First, the four-arm olfactometer was tested without coupling to the volatile delivery system. We studied the response of Rhynchophorus palmarum males and females to extracts of natural volatiles

(males feeding on sugarcane). We established the dose-response of O. rhinoceros to synthetic aggregation pheromone. The stimulus was deposited on a 15 × 15 filter paper placed in a 100 ml glass flask connected to an olfactometer input. The volatile delivery system could not be used for O. rhinoceros pheromone because it is not very soluble in water.
Second, responses of R. palmarum and S. aloeus to their synthetic pheromones were tested by coupling the four-arm olfactometer to the volatile delivery system.
Odours tested
The odour stimuli were prepared as follows: R. palmarum - Natural volatile extracts containing R. palmarum
pheromone and sugarcane volatiles. We sampled the odours emitted by 10 males fed on sugarcane for three days. Insects and food were placed in a 1-l glass flasks connected to a cartridge filled with

320.qxd 2/4/06 12:06 PM Page 12

an adsorbent (Supelpak-2, Supelco). An empty flask was prepared for control. Moistened and charcoal-purified air was drawn through the device at 100 ml/min. The adsorbent-trapped odours were eluted by 4 ml dichloromethane and concentrated under a nitrogen flow. GC analyses showed that the final pheromone concentration was 18 ng/µl. We used 20 µl of this extract, deposited on filter papers previously treated with 10 µl mineral oil (Sigma Chemical Co., U.S.A.) and renewed for each test. A solvent control was delivered through another randomly chosen arm.
The synthetic pheromone (Rochat et al. 1991), 2-methyl-(5E)hepten-4-ol (purity > 98 % by gas chromatography [GC]; E.G.N.O.Chimie, Tancarville, France), was diluted in ultra-pure water. At a pheromone concentration of 5 µg/ml with valve V1 open to give 50 % of the total delivery rate, a mass delivery rate of 1.1 ± 0.1 ng/s passed into the olfactometer. At a pheromone concentration of 1 µg/ml with valve V1 open to give 10 % of the total delivery rate, a mass delivery rate of 30 pg/s passed into the olfactometer.
S. aloeus - The synthetic pheromone (Rochat et al. 2000b) is a mixture (98:1:1 (v/v)) of 2-butanone (> 99.5 % GC; Janssen, Belgium), 3-pentanone (> 98 % GC; Aldrich, Gillingham, U.K.) and sec-butyl acetate (> 99 % GC; Aldrich, Milwaukee, U.S.A.). An aqueous solution of the pheromone was prepared at 50 ng/ml. The valve V1 was fully open and allowed 100 % of the total delivery rate to pass into the olfactometer, yielding 25 pg/s of the pheromone.
O. rhinoceros - The synthetic pheromone (Hallett et al. 1995) is ethyl 4-methyloctanoate (> 98 % GC; E.G.N.O.-Chimie). Six pheromone solutions in high grade hexane (10-1 to 105 ng/µl; decadic steps) were prepared. One µl of pheromone solution was deposited on a 15 × 15 mm filter paper previously treated with 10 µl mineral oil (Sigma Chemical Co., U.S.A.) for each test. A solvent control was delivered through another randomly chosen arm.

Bioassay procedure
We used configuration E (Fig. 2) with a flow rate of 500 ml/min in each arm. To facilitate movements of insects, a plastic lattice (4 mm2 mesh, 1 mm thick) was stuck onto the floor of the exposure chamber. Bioassays were conducted under the red light when the activity of these insects peaked. R. palmarum and O. rhinoceros were tested within the first three hours of the scotophase, at 25 ± 1 °C. S. aloeus were tested between the second and the sixth hour of the scotophase, at 28° ± 1 °C. Insects were placed individually in the centre of the olfactometer. Tests lasted 10 min. Movements of insects in the different fields were recorded by an adapted data-processing software (EVEN v. 1.0; INRA, France). Each of the four fields was considered a separate zone, when recording beetle positions and responses to test volatiles. A fifth zone, CZ, in the exposure chamber corresponded to a 9 cm circular central zone where the airflows from the four arms mixed.
We followed the insects visually and recorded their entries into the different fields with the keyboard. EVEN software (INRA, France) calculated time spent in each field. A test began once the insect started to move. We considered that an insect entered a given field when its entire thorax crossed the zone boundary. A test was not retained when - an insect remained motionless in the central zone for more than 5 min or in one field for more than 9 min, - it fell on its back more than six times, or - time spent in the central zone was more than 10 % of the test duration. Seventeen to 20 R. palmarum and O. rhinoceros (ca. 1:1 male/female ratio) and 20 to 23 S. aloeus of each sex were tested for each dose.
Approximately 10-15 bioassay tests could be conducted with the olfactometer in one day. Assignment of treatments to the olfactometer arms was the same throughout a test day but was re-randomised for the next test day.

Response criteria and statistical analyses
Two criteria quantified behaviour: 1- time spent in each field; 2- number of insects that chose the odorised field at the beginning of the test (first choice). One-way ANOVAs compared mean times spent in each of the four fields [(x+0.5)1/2 transformed data; insects

Results and discussion
Vet et al.’s (1983) protocol, using smoke to visualize airflows in a four-arm olfactometer was incompatible with the use of our thin mesh grids. Therefore, visualizing airflows by discolouring sensitive papers with acid vapours proved to be an interesting method to determine airflow limits and paths. Airflows were visualized for four airflow rates and five configurations of the set-up. In the first configurations (no grids, or only either in the air inputs or in the output; Fig. 2A-C) airflows were turbulent and extended beyond the theoretical limits of each field into the exposure chamber. Stainless steel grids yielded symmetrical prints showing that the atmospheres of the different fields did not mix (Fig. 2E). Therefore we chose configuration E for bioassays. Among the four different airflow rates tested, the 500 ml/min airflow rate gave the best digitized acidic prints (Fig. 2). However, the 150 ml/min flow gave a discolouration gradient decreasing from the airflow input to the central air output. On the other hand, the 1000 ml/min flow appeared too strong. Therefore, we chose the 500 ml/min flow for bioassays.
A circular central zone (CZ: ∅ = 9 cm) in the exposure chamber surrounding the central air output was discoloured independently of the field tested. The airflows from the four fields mixed in this central zone. This was not an inconvenience and, in fact, allowed the large beetles to perceive all the odours at the beginning of a test. Therefore, we adapted our recording procedure by adding a fifth zone: CZ.
The aqueous solution of R. palmarum pheromone reached Henry’s equilibrium in about 2 h that was maintained for 4-5 h under our experimental conditions. Relationships

Fig. 3 Relationships between manometer differences (cm H2O) versus pheromone (rhynchophorol) delivery rates (black triangles) and the air flow calibration curve (open circles), in two situations: volatile delivery system connected (top) or not (bottom) to the fourarm olfactometer. The aqueous pheromone solution (50 µg/ml) was ventilated by 9 ml/min charcoal-purified air at 25 °C
between airflow rates through the restrictor tube and pressure readings on the manometer were linear, whether the volatile delivery system was connected to the olfactometer or not (r2 = 0.99) (Fig. 3). Quantities of pheromone delivered by the volatile delivery system, connected or not to the olfactometer, were proportional to manometric differences (Fig. 3; linear adjustment r2 of 0.99 and 0.98, respectively). Coupling the volatile delivery system to the olfactometer did not influence VOC delivery rates for the same manometric difference.
Coupling the four-arm olfactometer to the volatile delivery system did not impair the physical functioning of either of the two devices. One advantage of the volatile delivery system was the absence of organic solvents, thus providing true blank controls and thereby eliminating risks that insects responded to the solvent. The only delicate factor was the intrinsic sensitivity of the volatile delivery system to temperature variations, because it was based on thermodynamics equilibrium (Betterton 1992). Nevertheless, in the thermostatic experimental room, small temperature variations (1 °C) had negligible effects on the pheromone mass flow actually delivered (2 to 5 %).
All three species responded significantly to their synthetic pheromones (Fig. 4-5). In most test series data for only one or two, out of a dozen insects, had to be discarded (no reaction after 5 min). Insects generally spent less than 1 min in the central zone. They entered the odorized field quickly when presented most of the tested odours. When insects moved out of the odorized field into an adjacent field, they tended to stop for a short time, to pick up their antennae, and then to return to the odorized field. Although

these beetles are good flyers and approach their host plants by flight, they walked most of the time in the olfactometer. O. rhinoceros made a few flying attempts and when they occurred tests aborted rarely and only if beetles fell on their backs more than six times.
When presented extracts of natural volatiles in the fourarm olfactometer, R. palmarum spent only a short time in the central zone (< 1 min) and chose rapidly one of the odour fields. Males (n = 20) and females (n = 14) chose the field odorized by the natural extract, respectively in 75 and 78 % of the tests (P < 0.001; binomial test). As soon as insects crossed this odourized field towards an adjacent one, they stopped for a moment, straightened their antennae and then went back to the odourized field. Insects spent significantly more time in the odourized field than in the other fields (females: F(3,39) = 14.02; P < 0.001; males: F(3,57) = 15.92; P < 0.001) (Fig. 4).
Oryctes rhinoceros spent significantly more time in the pheromone field than in the control field (blank and solvent) when presented 103 to 105 ng doses on filter paper (Fig. 5). When presented 10 ng doses, time spent in the pheromone field did not differ significantly from time spent in the solvent control field (27 ± 8 % test duration), but was significantly greater than time spent in the blank field (14 ± 3 and 17 ± 6 % test duration). The preference for the pheromone field reached a plateau at the three highest doses (103, 104 and 105 ng) (between 42 ± 4 % and 45 ± 5 % test duration). The first choices (50, 70, 70, 72 and 68 % of the tests) for the pheromone field were significant from 1 to 105 ng (P < 0.0; binomial test).
R. palmarum responded similarly to a constant concentration of the pheromone delivered by the volatile delivery system. Only two tests had to be discarded as those insects had not reacted after 5 min. Insects chose significantly the pheromone field at the beginning of 62 and 75 % of the tests when stimulated by 30 pg/s and 1.1 ng/s respectively (n = 20; P < 0.001; binomial test). They remained in the pheromone field (40 ± 4 % and 64 ± 5 %) significantly longer than in the control field when stimulated by 30 pg/s (F (3,57) = 25.19; P < 0.001) and by 1.1 ng/s (F(3,57) = 7.95, P < 0.05) (Fig. 4).
Male and female S. aloeus responded differently to the synthetic aggregation pheromone dispensed by the volatile delivery system. Females spent significantly more time in the pheromone field (46 ± 8 % of the test duration) than in the control fields (F(3, 57) = 8.27, P < 0.05) (Fig. 4). The pheromone field was chosen first by 60 % of the females (P < 0.01, binomial tests). Males spent as long in the pheromone field as in the control fields. At the beginning of the tests, males avoided the pheromone field and 52 % of them chose the opposite field (P < 0.005, binomial tests).
Behaviour of palm beetles was reliable and replicable in the four-arm olfactometer. The fact that a high proportion of the subjects chose the odourized field first, where, in addition, they spent the most time, showed that these insects could perceive and discriminate the odour and the limits of each field and confirmed that the atmospheres of the fields did not mix.
Insects responded to much lower doses of pheromones and significant responses were obtained with fewer individuals in the four-arm olfactometer, whether it was coupled or not to the volatile delivery system, than in the pitfall or

Fig. 4 Responses of Rhynchophorus palmarum and Strategus aloeus in the four-arm olfactometer to natural extracts and synthetic aggregation pheromones after 10 min. The natural extract of volatiles emitted by R. palmarum on sugarcane (natural pheromone and plant odours) was deposited on filter paper (20 µl). The synthetic aggregation pheromones of R. palmarum (1.1 ng/s and 0.03 ng/s) and of S. aleous (25 pg/s) were dispensed by the volatile delivery system. Mean times spent in each of the four fields with the same letters do not differ significantly (NewmanKeuls’ tests; P < 0.05)
Y-tube olfactometers. R. palmarum appeared less stressed in this olfactometer than in a pitfall olfactometer or in a modified wind tunnel (Rochat et al. 1991, 2000a). In a pitfall olfactometer, 10 ng of aggregation pheromone on a filter paper and 63 R. palmarum, each tested for 30 min, were necessary to obtain a significant result. Here, a significant result was recorded with only 20 weevils tested for 10 min and using 30 pg/s or 1.1 ng/s pheromone delivery rates. In a pitfall olfactometer, O. rhinoceros, reacted only to pheromone doses equal or greater than 1 µg, and 80 insects were necessary to obtain a significant result (Rochat, unpublished data), whereas results were significant in the four-arm olfactometer for 10 ng/s and 17 insects. Stimulation by constant controlled concentrations yields a more precise measure of the response threshold of insects to chemical signals. Hallett et al. (1995) reported positive responses of this species, but they used as much as 612 ng pheromone (600 ng ethyl 4-methyloctanoate + 12 ng ethyl 4-methylheptanoate) and 68 individuals in a Y-tube olfactometer; they did not report the number of nonresponding beetles. S. aloeus females reacted significantly to about 1 000 times less pheromone (15 ng/10-min test) when 20 µg was deposited on filter paper (Rochat et al. 2000b). Reactions of males at the lowest doses showed that some individuals clearly avoided the pheromone.
The literature gives few examples of laboratory studies of the responses of large flying Coleoptera to semiochemicals. In most cases, these studies either used large devices (wind tunnels or Y-shaped tubes) or were conducted in bioassay rooms: e.g. cerambycids, responding to either kairomones (Monochamus alternatus, Hope; Sakai & Yamasaki 1990) or pheromones (Xylotrechus pyrrhoderus,

Bates; Iwabuchi et al. 1986). Despite extensive field experiments, responses of palm beetles to semiochemicals have rarely been investigated in the laboratory (Gunawardena et al. 1998; Hallett et al.1995; Jaffé et al. 1993; Rochat et al.1991). Coupling gas-chromatography with electroantennography allows the identification of semiochemicals potentially active for palm beetles (e.g. Gries et al. 1994a, b; Gunawardena et al. 1998). This technique can be used for screening, but it cannot give any indications about the behavioural impact of the compounds. Laboratory bioassays, other than ours, implied generally Y-shaped olfactometers, operated with high doses of semiochemicals (> 10 µg; op. cit. references). Various sizes of the four-arm olfactometer have been used successfully to study hymenopteran parasitoids, the honeybee Apis mellifera, and the sugarcane weevil Metamasius hemipterus (Pham-Delègue et al. 1991; Ramirez-Lucas et al. 1996; Vet et al. 1983), but no olfactometer large enough to house palm weevils had previously been tested.
To conclude, coupling the volatile delivery system to the four-arm olfactometer provides an efficient tool to deliver low doses of very volatile compounds such as the pheromone of S. aloeus and plant odours, and to eliminate the presence of solvents that, in some cases, can have an attractive or repellent effect. As shown by Bartelt and Zilkowski (1998), the volatile delivery system controls concentrations of natural stimuli and synthetic stimuli with the same efficiency. This property is interesting as it allows investigation of the effect of natural compounds at realistic doses. Recently, a six-arm olfactometer, developed by Turlings et al. (2004), enabled observation of insect attraction to simultaneously trapped natural odours. The advantage of our system is the possibility to modulate odour doses using the same source. The four-arm olfactometer coupled to the volatile delivery system is suitable for different large beetles and should enable investigation of their behaviour such as responses to several semiochemicals in multi-choice

configurations. Saïd et al. (2005), evidenced a clear synergistic response of male and female R. palmarum to mixture of pheromone and plant odour (acetoin), using the four-arm olfactometer. Detailed dose-response relationships and synergy evaluation to pheromone and plant odour in R. palmarum, using the volatile delivery system, are reported in Saïd & Rochat (submitted).
