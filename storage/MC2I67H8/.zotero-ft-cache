Step 5. Wrap polyethylene tubing twice around the extended telescoping pole and secure with tape just after the twist lock of the second section. (This will act as an extension limiter, preventing the pole from over extending and coming out when in the field).

Step 7. Use electrical tape again to attach the trigger end of the wand to the pole four feet up from the base of the pole.

Aspray wand extender can be used to safely apply pesticide directly to the crowns of tall palm trees. The DIY wand extender was designed to control adult Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle (CRB) damage to palm trees. Commercial and home applicators often use elevators or ladders, which are potentially dangerous. The spray wand extender reduces the amount of offsite pesticide movement and is a more cost effective method for pesticide application in tall palms. Here are step-by-step instructions to Do-It-Yourself! But, first…

Step 1. Cut the sprayer wand into two equal parts with the handsaw.

Step 3. Insert the other half of the polyethylene tubing midway into clear vinyl tubing connected to the nozzle half of the spray wand. Repeat process on other end of the sprayer wand. Use zip ties to secure the tube ending.

ALWAYS READ AND FOLLOW THE PESTICIDE LABEL!
When handling and applying pesticides, use all the label-required Personal
Protective Equipment, and follow all dosage instructions and handling procedures that is
stated on the pesticide label.

Step 2. Cut clear vinyl tubing into two, 2 inch long pieces and insert them midway over the cut ends of the sprayer wand.

Step 4. Fully extend the telescoping pole top end and tape the nozzle to the top end on the pole.
