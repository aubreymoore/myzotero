Abstract

In 1972  to 1973 the non-endemic Oryctes Nudivirus (OrNV) was established at three sites on Viti Levu, Fiji, where the introduced rhinoceros beetle Oryctes rhinoceros was causing heavy damage to coconut crowns and frequently killing the palms. The establishment of OrNV, and its dissemination by adults, was followed by a marked reduction in the beetle population and damage. When re-surveyed 35 years later, damage was still at a low level. It is postulated that Oryctes Nudivirus is still helping to lower damage and manage O. rhinoceros populations at those sites.

Key words: Oryctes rhinoceros, Oryctes Nudivirus, coconut, Larvae, breeding site rhinoceros beetle.

Abbreviation:

OrNV, Oryctes Nudivirus.
