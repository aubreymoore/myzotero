The 2016 Festival of Pacific Arts will bring in about 2,500 delegates from across the region to share their cultural traditions and art from May 22 — June 4.

The festival’s biosecurity committee must work hard to ensure it doesn’t bring in anything unwanted, notably invasive species that could wreak havoc on the island’s environment.

More than 20 island nations will bring materials with them to help them demonstrate a variety of cultural arts and activities. The biosecurity committee — which includes the Guam Customs and Quarantine Agency, Port Authority of Guam, A.B. Won Pat International Airport Authority of Guam and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service — are charged with making sure those materials don’t include insects or other organisms that pose a threat to Guam.

In March, a container of cut nipa leaves from the Philippines had blue flies , according to Customs and Quarantine. The leaves were meant for use on the concrete huts built at Paseo for the festival.

Even though the container had a certificate stating it was fumigated before leaving the Philippines, blue flies were found and the container resealed. Though the USDA says the blue flies are “non-actionable,” meaning they’re not known to have any economic damage, the container was treated repeatedly. A follow-up inspection showed it was free of any live pests or invasive species.

And the visiting nations also are counting on these agencies to ensure that nothing from Guam leaves with them — like the coconut rhinoceros beetle , little fire ants and brown tree snake — when they return home after FestPac.

The committee will provide guidance and will screen materials before they leave Guam, he said.

Kudos to Customs and Quarantine for catching the blue fly threat and neutralizing it. The community is relying on all the agencies involved with biosecurity for FestPac to continue this vigilance and ensure the protection of Guam and the visiting islands.
