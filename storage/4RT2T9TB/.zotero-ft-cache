21 Challenges in measuring global insect decline
22
23
24 ABSTRACT
25 Global rates of insect decline will be very hard to measure. Conclusions regarding drivers and 26 rates of declines can be unreliable due to biases - including sampling location and omission 27 of relevant publications through narrow search terms. Extrapolation of global species declines 28 from a few regions or a sample disproportionately including population loss at range-margins 29 is indefensible, and the projected global rate of loss can be seriously overestimated. Samples 30 of insect declines (e.g. reviewed publications) must not overlap in space and time, which 31 would violate observation independence. The threat from climate change can be inflated if 32 declines are not separated from the effects of seasonality and activity. Measures of density, 33 not activity-abundance, are most valuable. No extinction can be firmly attributed to 34 anthropogenic climate change unless the climate trend can also be attributed to humans. The 35 role of pesticides will be inflated if developed nations dominate in the samples. We suggest 36 some minimal methodological requirements when reviewing declines and extinctions. Given 37 these strictures, we reaffirm that declines in most non-marine invertebrate groups will have to 38 be estimated using previously calibrated indicators such as birds and freshwater fish.

47 1. Introduction
48 Meeting policy targets on preventing biodiversity loss requires measures of rates of loss, and 49 insects will likely be a major fraction of terrestrial extinctions. Recent reports of insect 50 decline (Lister and Garcia, 2018; Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhus, 2019) have received 51 considerable and often uncritical media reporting (e.g. BBC, 2019, Carrington, 2019) which, 52 if overstating the rates, will erode public confidence in science and be detrimental to 53 conservation. Here we demonstrate that it is not possible to measure directly the overall
2

54 global rates of population decline, biomass decline or extinction in insects, since data are too 55 sparse and measuring insect abundance is challenging, even in the short term.
56
57 General reviews of threat and extinction rates (e.g. Thomas et al., 2004; Stork, 2010; 58 Hambler et al., 2011; Hambler and Canney, 2013) reveal the challenges of estimates and the 59 paucity of data on most invertebrate taxa. The shortage of taxonomists and studies render 60 extinction risks in most groups of organism very poorly known and controversial (Minelli et 61 al., 2010; Stork, 2010; Lockwood, 2011; Costello et al., 2013).
62
63 It has been proposed (Hambler et al., 2011) that in addition to measuring loss of habitat area, 64 calibrated indicator taxa such as birds and freshwater fish can provide the best information 65 available on extinction rates - now and in the future. Some work suggests extinction rates and 66 the proportions threatened are similar for insects and vertebrates (May et al., 1995; Hambler 67 and Speight, 2004; Hambler et al., 2011; Hambler and Canney, 2013). Regional extinction 68 rates for British butterflies are higher than for British birds, although many reported global 69 and regional rates for invertebrates are much lower than for vertebrates (Thomas et al., 2004; 70 Hambler et al., 2011). Similarity of extinction rates is in accord with habitat loss as the main 71 driver of declines and extinction through species area effects (Hambler et al., 2011).
72
73 We consider here the requirements when performing direct measurement of large-scale trends 74 in invertebrate populations, biomass or species. We examine how bias can arise in a review 75 of global rates of loss of and how to reduce bias.
76
77
78 2. Methodology
79 2.1 Regional bias
80 To obtain a general global extinction rate would require a representative sample of population 81 changes, such as a random sample from the planet. If the sample used is spatially 82 unrepresentative (as in Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhus, 2019) then extrapolation cannot be 83 defended.
84
85 2.2 Range margin bias
86 Global extrapolation of the declines would require a sample from a representative part of 87 each species' range. In contrast Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhus (2019) use numerous regional
3

88 declines, several from range margins of species. The range margin species may have higher 89 extinction rates (Shaw, 2005; Hambler et al., 2011; Henderson and Magurran, 2014).
90
91 The use of regional or national 'red lists' in a review (such as Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhus, 92 2019) will inflate the calculated extinction rate. The percentage of 'endangered' species will 93 be overstated because regional red lists include species that are globally not threatened - for 94 example butterfly species in Britain. Regional 'red listing' using IUCN trend criteria is 95 unacceptably influenced by short term-trends and start dates (Fox et al., 2018).
96
97 In a long-term study of an entire fish and crustacean community the core community was 98 notably stable while a larger number of transient species fluctuated greatly and often went 99 locally extinct. These transient or tourist species were typically adapted to conditions found 100 elsewhere, predominately the more species-rich waters to the south (Magurran and 101 Henderson, 2003; Henderson and Magurran, 2014). There is now an extensive literature 102 showing the existence of core and transient components of stable ecosystems with continual 103 loss and gain of species on the edge of their range.
104
105 2.3 Taxon bias
106 'Red lists' for insects are unrepresentative of insects: they are mainly available for species107 poor, conspicuous, charismatic groups (e.g. butterflies, odonates) and tend to focus on groups 108 already known to be at high risk (e.g. saproxylic insects; odonates). Several of the taxa used 109 in Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhus (2019) are relatively thermophilous and are at the high end of 110 regional extinction rates in Britain (Hambler et al., 2011) or Scotland (Shaw, 2005). There 111 has been a long debate on how typical termophilous taxa (such as butterflies) are of other taxa 112 (e.g. Thomas et al., 1994; Hambler and Speight, 2004; Thomas et al. 2004; Thomas and 113 Clarke, 2004).
114
115 Regional rates of decline have been recorded for very few insect taxa. Sánchez-Bayo and 116 Wyckhus (2019) were able to discover fewer than 100 reports meeting their very narrow 117 criteria. These authors gave a headline figure of insect species in decline which appears to be 118 an average only of the taxa in their review, rendering their conclusions on global declines 119 indefensible.
120
121 When comparing rates with taxa such as vertebrates, the samples of other taxa should also be 122 representative. In contrast, Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhus (2019) suggest the global rate of 123 extinction of vertebrates to be "a large margin" lower than for insects, yet fish do not appear 124 to be included.

125
126 2.4 Search Term scope and bias
127 The search terms used in any literature review must be fit for purpose: a sole focus on decline 128 (as in Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhus, 2019) will bias against trends of population growth, and 129 miss extinctions or population stability. Searching only for "insect*" will miss some titles on 130 invertebrates, or on animals, which include insects. Terms such as "trend" or "extinction" 131 would reveal other studies of declines.
132
133 A limited search can lead to factual inaccuracy, as in Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhus (2019) 134 who make false statements on lack of data for ants, saproxylic beetles and Orthoptera. Yet 135 Hambler et al. (2011) list regional extinctions in these groups over a specified timeframe (200 136 years) in Britain, and other highly relevant data are available (Shirt, 1987; Bratten, 1991; 137 Shaw, 2005). Hambler et al. (2011) provide data on aquatic insects but these were not found 138 by Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhus (2019), and only one study was found for Hemiptera 139 missing the major long-term study by Southwood et al. (2003).
140
141 Search bias could lead to oversights: for example Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhus (2019) do not 142 include the evidence on extinction rates from several relevant studies (e.g. May et al., 1995; 143 Shaw, 2005; Stork, 2010; Hambler et al., 2011; Hambler and Canney, 2013).
144
145 2.5 Literature bias
146 A broad net is required to capture published data in invertebrate declines. Sánchez-Bayo and 147 Wyckhus (2019) "aimed at compiling all long-term insect surveys conducted over the past 40 148 years that are available through global peer-reviewed literature databases." This was 149 reportedly attempted primarily through a search on the online Web of Science. Such a 150 specialised database can omit books, book chapters and possibly relevant grey literature (all 151 of which can be peer-reviewed, although this is no guarantee of quality).
152
153 2.6 Reporting bias
154 We suggest few ecologists are motivated to publish a report on 'healthy' insect populations. A 155 notable exception is Shortall et al. (2009).
156

159 2.7 Extrapolation risks
160 Net trends are required for extrapolations. If only declining trends are extrapolated, it will 161 erroneously lead to exaggerated conclusions of losses. For example Sánchez-Bayo and 162 Wyckhus (2019) and Sánchez-Bayo (quoted 2019) apparently extrapolate an estimated 2.5% 163 annual loss in a sample of publications to complete loss of all populations and species of 164 insect by the year 2100!
165
166 Extrapolation from declining species ignores the chance that some of these would be 167 temporary declines, or population cycles, as with fish (Henderson and Magurran, 2014). 168 Moreover, rates may diminish after the initial loss of the most sensitive species (Hambler et 169 al., 2011) or during relaxation after habitat loss (Hambler and Canney, 2013).
170
171 Consider also the reverse trend: if search terms acquire selectively publications showing 172 species gains over a specified timescale, this could be extrapolated to suggest that the world 173 would have a larger number of species by 2100. Indeed, depending on the studies used and 174 the net rate of species gain a prediction could be made that Earth would trend to holding an 175 infinite number of species.
176
177 2.8 Driver attribution
178 The subjective selection of types of potential driver of decline (habitat change, pollution, 179 biological traits, climate change) can inevitably make some factors appear important. If driver 180 categories are lumped, or split, in alternative ways then their relative contributions can be 181 arbitrarily adjusted. Terminology on threat is also likely to vary between the various 182 publications, with some authors more likely or prepared to use some terms.
183
184 When performing meta-analysis of a range of reviews, it is crucial that the number of species 185 in each case is accommodated: otherwise declines in taxa with many species such as 186 Hymenoptera will be given equal weight to taxa with far fewer such as butterflies. If each 187 study is given equal weight the proportion of global species being driven by each factor 188 cannot be calculated - yet Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhus (2019) attempt this.
189
190 It will be very difficult to make attributions of population declines to anthropogenic climate 191 change, given uncertainties in attributing global, and particularly regional, climate trends to 192 pollutants (IPCC, 2013). It is more difficult to distinguish an anthropogenic climate signal 193 distinct from natural variation prior to 1950 (IPCC, 2013). Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhus 194 (2019) conclude (on the basis of only 3 tropical studies) that climate change is "particularly
6

195 important in tropical regions". Yet the higher levels of endemism of tropical insects are 196 evidence of how robust to climate changes the tropical species have been and should remain 197 (Hambler and Canney, 2013).
198
199 It is crucial that there is not double-counting of drivers, for example in climate categories. In 200 Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhus (2019) the method of attribution of climate change as a driver in 201 6.9% of studies is insufficient for replication, but perhaps assumes 5% from "climate 202 warming" plus all "bushfires" (1.9%). However, some bushfires are natural. Globally, the 203 area burnt decreased from 1996 and 2012 and regional attribution of fire is highly 204 problematic (Doerr and Santín, 2016; Ward et al., 2018). Moreover, bushfires might be 205 caused by warming (Doerr and Santín, 2016) so these criteria are not independent - yet are 206 apparently treated as such in Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhus, (2019). The net result of 207 overlooking these considerations would be to inflate the role of climate change, as may 208 subsequent media reports (e.g. BBC, 2019).
209
210 Alternatively, the global Red List (IUCN, 2019) can be searched by 'threat' for putative 211 drivers of declines. For example, this reveals four 'extinct' insect species assessed as possibly 212 impacted by climate change (natural or anthropogenic), and none of these global insect 213 extinctions can be firmly attributed to post 1950 climate change.
214
215 As another example, the proportion of species allegedly affected by pesticides could be an 216 artefact if there is location bias towards industrialised regions with more surveys in intensive 217 agricultural landscapes, as in Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhus (2019).
218
219 2.9 Statistical rigour
220 Any review of declines must not make statistical errors.
221
222 Independence of data points is a typical requirement of statistical tests such as ANOVA. Yet 223 several of the 73 studies reviewed by Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhus (2019) are non224 independent in space and / or time. For example trends in butterflies in the U.K. are in more 225 than one study, and also overlap with data for Europe. The trend in Odonata for the world 226 may include the regional studies of this taxon.
227
228 It can be problematic to test for differences in rates of species in decline using ANOVA. 229 Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhus (2019) compare percentage declines in various regions and taxa.
7

230 This is unwise as these data inevitably lack independence in the observations, the residuals 231 will not be normal and the data will not be homoscedastic. A possible approach would be to 232 use a generalized linear model, but this may still be problematical if the various data sets are 233 not independent.
234
235 Similarly, non-independence of studies could render the overall proportion of publications 236 reporting a driver of decline potentially invalid as a summary statistic. This introduces errors 237 of pseudoreplication and duplication (double-counting) as in Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhus 238 (2019).
239
240 2.10 Reproducibility of methods, and standard IUCN criteria
241 It is important to be able to replicate some key results of a review of declines. This is not 242 always the case: Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhus (2019) claim "conservation status of individual 243 species follows the IUCN classification criteria (IUCN 2009)", but this reference is omitted 244 from the review's references. However, for some taxa the review uses national lists explicitly 245 distinguished from IUCN criteria (e.g. New Zealand carabid beetles, McGuinness, 2007).
246
247 Assigning the actual levels of threat such as "endangered" and "vulnerable" in a review 248 should be done in a consistent way for different taxa (Stork, 2010), if relevant specifying the 249 regional or global IUCN sub-criteria used (e.g. Fox et al., 2018). Attempts by non-specialist 250 authors to convert various declines into IUCN threat status using percentage declines over 251 unclear timeframes are problematic.
252
253 2.11 Accurate citation of past studies
254 It is important to represent accurately the results in any paper that is included in a review of 255 declines. As an example of inaccurate interpretation, Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhus (2019) 256 state that vertebrates in Puerto Rico declined "as a result of invertebrate food shortages", 257 which misrepresents Lister and Garcia (2018). It confuses correlation with causation - which 258 was unproven by Lister and Garcia (2018).
259
260 2.12 Measure abundance, not activity-abundance
261 Any study of decline requires accurate measures of abundance. In contrast, we argue Lister 262 and Garcia (2018) is deeply flawed because it misrepresents 'activity-abundance' measures 263 (Henderson and Southwood, 2016) as 'abundance'. The efficiency of sampling using traps and 264 visual observations will be dependent on weather and climate. Any trends in climate could
8

265 influence movements and phenology of invertebrates and vertebrates, even in the absence of 266 population change. Activity-dependent methods should not be used without consideration of 267 weather. Absolute samples (density measures) including knockdown sampling and vacuum 268 sampling are required (Hambler and Canney, 2013; Henderson and Southwood, 2016) yet 269 many published studies use pitfall traps, flight interceptor traps, baited traps, visual 270 observations or similar (e.g. Hallmann et al., 2017; Lister and Garcia, 2018).
271
272 2.13 Adequate time series, and measuring past rates
273 A reliable proof of trend cannot be obtained from sampling at only two points in time, a 274 notable failing of Lister and Garcia (2018). Consistent methods are required for long-term 275 monitoring (Hambler and Canney, 2013, and due to allegedly inconsistent climatology Lister 276 and Garcia (2018) is currently subject to a retraction request (Homewood 2019). This is one 277 of the tiny number of tropical studies (n = 3) in Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhus (2019); it is thus 278 absolutely crucial to that review's conclusions on climate and tropical insect decline, and to 279 implied subsequent effects.
280
281 In order to know if extinction rates are relatively rapid - perhaps even a mass extinction, 282 previous rates need to be known. This is extremely hard for insects. Yet Sánchez-Bayo and 283 Wyckhus (2019) claim that rates of loss are the largest since two mass extinctions (Late 284 Permian and Cretaceous. This conclusion is not possible for most invertebrates, even for the 285 mid Holocene. Subfossils reveal numerous insect species went extinct during the 286 deforestation of Britain in the Holocene (e.g. Buckland, 2008; Elias et al., 2009); the peak 287 extinction rate in this period and before it is unknown. Hambler et al. (2011) list numerous 288 19th Century regional insect extinctions, demonstrating high losses before pesticides and 289 anthropogenic climate change.
290
291 2.14. Rates of loss of biomass
292 The rate of loss of worldwide insect biomass will be particularly hard to estimate, despite 293 requiring less taxonomic effort. The average mass of a representative sample of regions and 294 taxa would have to be known, and these data are not available given the limited work in the 295 tropics. Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhus (2019 attempt to derive such a rate from a review of 296 studies showing biomass decline, yet these are unrepresentative taxonomically.

301 3. Conclusion and synthesis of recommendations 302 Any review of declines must not have structural bias and its methods and uncertainties must 303 be presented. We argue a review of declines with numerous methodological problems 304 (Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckhus, 2019) has already facilitated damaging uncritical reporting that 305 all insects on the planet may be extinct by the end of the century (e.g. BBC, 2019).
306
307 In the light of the biases and other problems discussed above, we suggest these minimal 308 standards for reviews of population trends and extinctions:
309
310 a) Representativeness of the locations of regional samples if claims are to be made about 311 global loss.
312
313 b) Representativeness of taxa if claims are to be made about much higher taxonomic levels 314 and about biomass.
315
316 c) Representativeness of search terms for population time series, including those that can 317 detect gains, losses, declines, increases, regional and global extinctions, colonisations and no 318 trends. Terms should ideally be in a range of languages. Publication and reporting bias 319 against studies showing no trend should be acknowledged.
320
321 d) Avoidance of pseudoreplication in reviewed studies. Studies of declines must be 322 independent in space and time, or if not, suitably nested in analysis.
323
324 e) Avoidance of double-counting of drivers, using nested classifications and interaction 325 terms if appropriate.
326
327 f) Searches need to include a wide range of literature not listed in the Web of Science.
328
329 g) Clarify when the IUCN has made or endorsed a threat assessment, such as "Endangered", 330 as opposed to authors claiming to have used IUCN classification methods.
331
10

332 h) Clarify the use of 'endangered', 'threatened' and 'extinct', if these are only regional, at all 333 points in a publication in which they might be misinterpreted.
334
335 i) Methods should be presented in sufficient detail for reproducibility.
336
337 j) If population trends are extrapolated to the future, or to other taxa, state the assumptions 338 being made.
339
340 k) Do not extrapolate trends from time series with an inadequate number of data points 341 (times).
342
343 l) Prioritise studies with consistent methods through time.
344
345 m) In headline statistics, give the error range and uncertainty.
346
347 In sum, we argue these requirements make direct measurements of invertebrate declines 348 impossible for the foreseeable future. Even if a very large number of insect density 349 monitoring stations were set up globally, and sampled frequently, it could take many decades 350 to detect trends - let alone attribute drivers. Without taxonomic knowledge and autecology 351 sufficient to assign species quality (Hambler and Canney, 2013) it would be hard to know if 352 trends were of concern.
353
354 Proxies such as rates of loss of birds, fish and habitat area are the only realistic methods of 355 assessing global wildlife decline. We may indeed be in a mass extinction (Barnosky, 2011; 356 Hambler and Canney, 2013), but the best evidence for this is presently from vertebrates.
