Description

My id, Telostylus philippinensis is a guess based upon images and comments in
https://diptera.info/forum/viewthread.php?thread_id=59435

There is a good match with images of the type specimen which are available at https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/1321561989

There seems to be some confusion on spelling of the genus: Telostylus in some references and Telostylinus in others.

Curt Fiedler sent me an image of Achaea janata caterpillar feeding on Euphorbia lactea being sold as an ornamental plant. The HOST database lists several species of Euphorbia as larval host plants for A. janata , but not E. lactea . So this may be a new host record.
