Executive Summary

XThe research was carried in FELDA Plantations in LEPAR UTARA 5, 9 and 14 under

FELDA Plantation Sdn. Bhd. Central Pahang between September 2003 and January

2006. This is the first kind of research on replanted oil palms (0-4 years old) on the

effect of zero burning on the bionomics of rhinoceros beetles (0. rhinoceros) (RB) and

its attack on the young palm:vc The decomposing felled trunks provided ample breeding

sites for RB immatures. ihe damages caused by RB on Tissue Culture (TC) palms were

higher than on the DXP palms. The mean percentage of damages was high as up to

(

67.4% in 1-2 years old TQ' Damages on different topographies were similar.

\ .'

.ABased from the pheromone trapping technique, some fresh information was revealed.

There was a distinct demarcation of direction that the beetles migrated from old mature

palms to nearby sites where felling and chipping of trunks were carried out. As the

migration is almost simultaneous with replanting, it would be essential to place the traps

alongside the fringes bordering mature palm before placing the traps within the replanting area.'{

t Pheromone traps can be installed within the replanting area after about 6 to 7 months

after Felling and Chipping (MAF), to coincide with the new emergence of adults. Adult

trapping can be stopped when first harvesting starts. At the same time, good trapping can

reduce the numbers of gravid female in field and decrease the probability of reproductive

female to lay eggs into the habitats:

-'- Field efficacy of Marshal, Furadan and naphthalene balls showed some effect of the RB.

Overall, a Marshal 5G 12 gram is the most effective than the other treatments but it had

the highest number of palms scorched. However it has the highest numbers of dead

1

beetles found followed by Marshal 5G 6 grams, Furadan 3G 30 grams and Marshal 5G 3 grams. 12 grams, 6 grams, and 3 grams Marshal 5G showed the best reduction of damages. The damage levels were below 10% damages after lOWeek of applications. This indeed demonstrated the reduction of damage percentages caused by rhinoceros
.... beetles at the end ofthe treatments due to the efficacy ofMarshal5G.

~
The immature of Rhinoceros beetle were sampled in decomposing trunks from 3 month
after felling and chipping (MAF) until the 18th months. Overall, in the 3, 4 and 5 MAF no

(

beetles of any stages were found. However, at 6 MAP RB immature started to appear in

the rotting trunk chips with a total 3 larvae from third instar, 1 prepupae, 1 pupae, and 5
•
adults, respectively. Started from 6 MAF, a significant of immature beetle population in

the rotting trunks, started to appear. Almost every month after 6 MAF, the first ,second

and third instars larvae were continuously observed in the samples until the end of sampling, the 18th MAF. The highest density of RB immatures and adults were found in

13 MAF. •

CHAPTERl
DAMAGE CENSUS CAUSE BY RHINOCEROS BEETLES IN REPLANTED OIL PALMS.
Objective: To evaluate the damages cause by rhinoceros beetles (Oryctes rhinoceros)
in replanted oil palm in zero burning area at FELDA Plantation Lepar Utara, Pahang according to planting materials, ages of palms and different topographies.
1.1 Introduction
Natural instinct has lead the rhinoceros beetles destroying developing young palms in fields. Prolonged and severe damage can result in delayed palm maturity. In 1999 (Chung et aI., 1999) combined the average crop loss for 569 palms plot caused by rhinoceros beetles had been estimated to be 53.16%. The result is more than the 40% value given by Liau and Ahmad (1993), and less than the 79% given by PPKS (1996) (Chung et. aI., 1999). That is why the census is needed to estimate effect of pest damage during immature phase on the early yields of oil palm. This procedure should be carried out in estates to determine the condition of estates. Infestation of RB continuous should be controlled by chemicals during serious attack is the best way and may reduce the yield loss by RB attack. The infestation is usually brought down by selective control in estates carrying out regular spraying of Cypermethrin at 0.05% every two weeks. Monitoring the
2

population dynamic by using pheromone trap is important in order to know the economic
injured level (EIL) of rhinoceros beetle in immature estates. This section will be
discussed later in Chapter 2.

The pests cause infestation by attacking the vegetative as well as the reproductive parts of

the palm namely the spindle, leaf, and petiole. The pest attack is more on the petiole

region with permanently marked holes than on the spindles and leaves. On the leaves RB

()

causes inverted "V" shaped cutting mark, which is due of the pest eating the leaf in the

crown stage before emerging out. On the spindle the pest causes the chewing marks,

which may lead to the breaking and drooping and also causes a conspicuous permanent

hole on the leaf petiole making the fond to break or snap with light winds (Kalidas, 2002)

(Table 1.0). Furthennore, it can leads to the invasion of secondary pests like red palm

weevil, earwig (Dermaptera), stag bug, and bud rot causing fungi.

L -, 1.1.1 Recognition of damages symptoms
Several symptoms of damage caused by RB on the canopy of oil palm are recognized and summarized in the table 1.0 below:

1.2 Materials and Methods
1.2.1 Evaluation of damages on palms in the 20 hectares plots.
Location of Sampling The study was conducted for three times in different location from May 2004 to January 2005 located at Ladang Lepar Utara 14 and09, FELDA Plantation, Jerantut, Pahang.
(
Sampling Procedures
The evaluations of damage palms caused by O. rhinoceros were initiated from a subplot ina20 hectares area. Census was taken by systematic sampling for 1300 palms, at every
even line. From visual assessment on the severity of damage, of 1300 palms each the
following categories were selected: severely damaged; more two injured/dead unopened spears (easily pulled out, fan shaped cut frond) or more than two fronds were bored or
snapped, slightly damaged; lrss than two unopened spear or l-2 fronds were injured,
dead/bored/snapped, and NiUnegligible; palms with no RB attack (Table 1.1 and Figure 1). Damage assessments on the number of damaged fronds and spears were evaluated. Each census was taken three times (May, September 2004 andJanuary 2005) for various location and type of planting materials for eight months (Table 1.2 and 1.3). The result showed the varying incidence level of damage in the wide area (20-hectares), different severity of damage on different ages of plantings and types of planting materials.

Census Procedures

From visual assessment on the severity of damage (severely damaged palms, slightly damaged palms and palms with no damage), 120 immature palms (1 ha) were selected
randomly from more than I hectare of various topographies. Damage assessment

evaluations were done on the number of damaged fronds and spears (Figure l) and were conducted in June 2004, September 2004 and January 2005. The description of the varying topographies such as roadside, hillside, hilltop, swamp and valley, and border of mature palm were detailed (Table 1.3). The result showed the varying incidences level of

1.4 Discussion
Palms in replanting areas are at risk because of the decaying logs of the former stand of oil palm providing breeding ground for RB larvae. The larvae of RB develop in rotting
organic material (Wood, 1968). Besides the zero burning, the eggs and larvae of RB are
abundance in the rotting palms. Nowadays, FELDA introduced two types of planting material in plantations; Dura X Pisifera (DxP) and Tissue culture (DxP). Lepar lJtan 14
was planted with more than 40 hectares with tissue culture varieties in Block 31 PM 80A. From the visual damage assessment, we found that tissue culture suffered more RB t,
damages due to the beetle foraging. Tissue culture (TC) 0-1 year at LU 14 (PM80A) showed 67.4% palm damages and TC l-2 years at LU 09 (PM84B) had49.7o/opalm
damages. This showed that O. rhinoceros preferred on tissue culture plantings than the DXP seedling planting materials. However, the incidences of RB damage will de reduced when palms is more three years old in all planting materials.

Evaluation of damages was carried in 5 different topographies (hilltop, hillside, roadside,

bordering to mature palms and swamps and valleys). Plantations of immature plants

L_1

bordering mature palms faced high risk to RB damage with a mean of 47.92% of palm

damages. This is because we believed that mature palms were providing second breeding

or foraging home to Oryctes(see Chapter 2). Similarly, the result had showed or proved

that different topographies did not contribute and related to the level of damages by

Oryctes to young oil palm. We can conlude i) Damages on palm caused by Oryctes did,

not inlluence by topographies, and or ii) Damages level of palms on various topographies

were almost similarlv.

CHAPTER 2

BIONOMIC OF ORYCTES RHINOCEROS ADULTS IN IMMATURE PALM CAUGHT BY PHEROMONE TRAPS
Objective: To investigate dynamic of Oryctes rhinoceros adults in immature oil palms for 14 months using pheromone traps in 4O-hectare plots at Lepar Utara 05, 14 and 09,
FELDA Plantations.
(
2.1 Introduction

Rhinoceros beetle is one of the impoitant pests of palms (family palmaeceae). Use of

aggregation pheromone ethyl4 - methyloctanoate was observed to be a potential tool for

controlling the beetles (Ho, 1996). The aggregating pheromone (Ap), oryctalure

@roduced by Chemtica International, Costa Rica) is responsible for effective trapping of

beetles and it has been used as another additional tool for control approach. Traps are

(_

used at a tate of two to fiveftra where there is good interrow legume cover. pheromone

trapping is one of safe chemical control components; it is ecologically safe and

environmentally friendly tool in IPM. The AP has been used for mass trapping,

monitoring and integrated with biocontrol and chemical conffol agents. Nevertheless, it

can decrease the population of adult in estates if rightly established. However the

reduction remains insuffrcient especially in plantations with high incidence of beetles.

T7

Noor Hisham et. al., (2001), recommended the rhinoceros aggregation pheromone, ethyl 4 - methyloctanoate to lure the beetle adults by keeping on ratio 1: 5 or l:10 hectare for situation in non-serious incidence or average caught is below 10 adults per trap per week.
But if the population increases or high incidence, it is recommended that one trap for every 2 ha of planted area. The recommendation was also stated by Norman et. al.,
(1999). Research carried by Pusat Pertanian Tun Razak (PPTR) Sungai Tekam, found that 56yo - 70% beetles caught were female. lndirectly, it will reduce the populations of
female adult especially gravid females and the next generations.
This lure has been found to be highly effective in Malaysia for mass trapping, by using
traps at the rate of one tap/2 ha, during low pest population, Le. < l0 to 15
beetles/traplweek (Turner et. a1.,2003). Sime RB pheromone was designed to dispense the pheromone aggregation for about one and half month to two months and varied
considerably in different weather conditions and how it was applied in the field. This study also will show how the sachet of Sime RB and trap is best manipulated in the frelds. Three sites were selected (i) Lepar Utara 05 planted in July 2004; ii) Lepar Utara 14 planted in planted in June 2003 and (iii) Lepar Utara 09 planted in June 2001.

The study was focused on the determination of population trends and infestation levels of

"

Oryctes rhinoceros in the oil palm replanted areas. The traps were evaluated ,rary

considerably on the height and age of young palm canopy. The bioeffrcacy of aggregation

pheromone (AP) into an 18-L bucket/bottle hung at the height of palm on a wooden

support with a black-painted vane to guide the beetles at a density of one trap per two

hectares for twenty hectares per location. Small drainage holes at the bottom of each

bucket and bottle were made to remove rainwater. Lepar Utara 0g (3-4 years old palm)

t9

used an 18-L bucket added water ( to avoid beetle crawling out of bucket) on a stand of
2.8 meter wooden support, while Lepar Utara 14 (t-2 years) and Lepar Utara 05 (0-1 year old) used bottle traps (FASSB design) on a stand of 2.0 meter wooden support (Figure
2.1). The traps were serviced weekly. The beetles caught were sexed, and counted. The trapping was carried out for thirteen months. The AP sachets were established with cover and were replaced when either beetle catch decreased to zero or very low number or the lure odorless, approximately every two months.

(

The economic- injury level (EIL) is defined as the lowest number of Oryctes that will

cause economic damage, or the minimum number of insects that would delay the

growth/yield equal to the gain threshold. While, General Equilibrium Position (GEP) is a

population long-term average density.

2.3 Results

The trap was effective in trappings adult beetles (Figure 2.1) and the oryctalure was

covered to prevent evaporation. In term of strategies, some ethyl 4 - methyloctanoate was

manipulated by covering the sachet in order to minimize excessive evaporation process.

It is important to use the pheromone optimally (up to two months). However, the

(-.

longevity of the lure may vary considerably according to the prevailing weather

conditions. Drop in beetle number captures was observed during drought season

(February, 2005 -April, 2005).

The haps were laid in the second weeks of October 2004 (i.e 3 Month After Replanting -

MAR) at Lepar Utara 05 (PM0IB). Mean numbers of beetles OINB) caught by the traps
for 3 months after replanting (MAR) was below l0 individuals' ha-2 week-r trap- I

(IPHsWT) in fust five weeks (Figure 2.2). Startng from weeks two in December 2004,

the GEP and EIL were lying on similarly level but suddenly increased above EIL after l0

(i

MAR. The highest mean numbers beetles (I\AIB) were caught in the end of September,

2005 (i.e 14 MAR), with 39.6 MNB and the lowest MNB (7.0 MNB) was in first week in

February 2005 (i.e 7 MAR).

After l0 MAR, the number of beetles increased suddenly and continued to increase
above the economy injured level @IL). The increase was very fast and two months later

22

(i.e 12 MAR) the number of beetles caught was above from the general equilibrium position (GEP). The situation was very serious in 15 MAR.

Traps at LU 14 were installed one year after planting (i. e 12 MAR). A total 42.41ha

were planted by tissue culture material in block 31 PM 80A. The mean number of beetles

(lvtNB) was 29.8 in first week of 12 MAR (Figure 2.3). The highest MNB was shown in

second week of November 2004 (16 MAR) with 68.2 MNB and the lowest numbers of

beetles was found in first week of May, 2005 (i.e. 22 MAR) with 6.1 MNB. General

{l

Equilibrium Level was around GEP when the MNB were between 30 to 40. At last, it

suddenly decreased in first week of 18 MAR but still above of the EIL. Mean number of
beetles were below l0 individuals' haz week-l trap- t (IPHsWT) after 8 month of

installing the trap or 21 MAR. But the beetle population increased again after 24 MAR.

The numbers of beetles after first week of June 2005 (i.e. 24 MAR) were increasing from
ll.2to 18.3 until the evaluation of traps were ceased.

Meanwhile, the traps were laid in third weeks of May 2004 (i.e. 34 MAR) in LU9. Mean

(,

numbers of beetles caught by the pheromone traps at LU 09 showed the highest record in

September 2004 (i.e.38 MAR) with 35.0 MNB and the lowest was in 39 MAR with

mean numbers of beetles is 1.2 (Figure 2.4). Only after 39 MA& the MNB was below
EIL. It is believed that the infestation levels of Oryctes rhinoceros were maintained

below l0 individuals' haz trap- ' (IPHsWT) after 38 MAR. General equilibrium position

of Oryctes populations was always above 15 IPHsWT before 39 months after replanting

(MAR).

2.4 Discussion

Pheromones are biochemicals used for communication between two or more animals of a
single species. The most conspicuous use of pheromone by insects is causing other members of the same species to aggregate in a particular area (Chung, lggT).ln term of strategies, utilization of pherotraps in replantations or a large scale covering a year of planting completely, instead of individual blocks where heavy attack occur would
possible maintain the Orytes population under EIL. Norman et al.,(2001) documented
(,
with high-density trapping, infestations levels were maintained below l0 individuals m2 (IPMS) and were not detect in the heaps after a period of 16 months of replanting. In the
normal trapping density, the populations were also maintained below 10 individuals m2 (IPMS) were found present in the heaps for up to 24 months.

Study on bionomic of adult beetles was conducted for 13 months. It provided new

experiences and data with weather and some inferences. When the numbers of beetles

reached the Economy Injured Level (EIL) that would put the estates in the ready state to

L;

manage the pest attack. Where General equilibrium position (GEP) provides the

population long-term average density. When GEP is above the EIL then the combination

of crop, environmen! time and lack of parasitoid or predator was probably caused the

population abundance of Oryctes in plantation. The GEP must be below the EIL for

achieving good profit.

28

Three trap designs were evaluated and were found higtrly effective in mass trapping. A new design was introduced as a modification from FASSB model. It is easy to handle in the field. Costing and time saving were the factors considered with low maintenance (Figure 2.l.iii). Using the trap will directly monitor the population level or reduce the population of RB. From the three graphs above (Figure 2.2,Figare2.3 and Figure 2.4) It is predicted the Figure 2.5 will be a pattern of RB in estates started from palm planting
until up to 46 months after replanting (MAR). The high level is caused by the
intraspecies-competition and lack of breeding sites or food. The beetle populations were
decreasing slowly until palms become 4 years old (48 MAR) (Norman, 2001) but RB will not be eliminated in oil palm estate monoculture.
The mean numbers of beetles (MNB) at Lepar Utara 14 and 09 were always below the EIL although number of adults bounce back in June 2005 at Lepar Utara 14 but for LU
05 MNB it is predicted to increase as the situation of MNB caught at LU 09 and LU14. At least, this is an indicator that the trap catches were insuffrcient to bring down the
population to below economic injury level (EIL).

Figure 2.5: Prediction on pattern of abundance of rhino beetles caught by traps from
replanted oil palms of 0-4 years old.

In mid of June 2005, Lepar Utara 05 was carrying out felling and chipping which started

from June 15 to August 20,2005 for 487.57 ha bounder by mature palm, block PM 0lB.

This situation has related with the phenomena called "Desperate immigrations" by adults

(;

RB and is shown by traps on PM 0lB (see also Figure 2.2) where the adult beetles caught

on traps suddenly increased especially in border areas. A more recent study has suggested
that in certain areas, O. rhinoceros can readily migrate to infest an area as soon as

replanting is conducted, i.e. when there is an abundance of oil palm trunk chips (Noman

et al., 1999). From the inspection, we observed that traps bordering on the mature palm

were showing continuously high density of RB catches.

30

The cause of the increasing in numbers of beetles caught by pheromone trap at LU 14 on
the 24 months after replanting (MAR) was probably due to the installation of "sponge pif' application in field. The empty fruits bunches (EFB) were dumped in 5" x 16' x 4,,
sponge pit for soil moisturizing and nutrient which became the breeding site for Oryctes.

2.5 Conclusion

(.
Based from the trapping technique, some fresh information was revealed. From the figure
2.2, there was a distinct demarcation of direction that the beetles migrated from old
mature palms to a nearby site where felling and chipping of trunks were carried out. Thus field was abundant with RB coming to our traps and may cause the increase in damages
on the palms. As the migration is almost simultaneous with replanting, it would be
essential to place the traps alongside the fringes bordering mature palm before placing the traps within the replanting area.

(;

With such suggestion, pheromone traps can be installed within the replanting area after

about 6 to 7 months after Felling and chipping (MAF), to coincide with the new

emergence of adults. For best result, adult trapping can be stopped when frst harvesting

starts. At the same time, good trapping can reduce the numbers of gravid female in field

and decrease the probability of reproductive female to lay eggs into the habitats. This is

observed as the adult population was high in Juty until end of october.

'

Predation by the rats Rattus tiomanicus and R. argiventus, black cobra, fox species and

iguana on the RB caught were the interference the tap catches. The interferences were

common among kaps in border to forest area. The predators decreased the accuracies of

data.

CHAPTER 3

FIELD EFFICACY STUDY OF SEVERAL INSECTICIDES AGAINTS ADULT OF Oryctes rhinoceros (L.)

Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of several insecticides against Oryctes rhinoceros in
immature sensitive oil palms.
( 't. d
3.1 Introduction

.

Several methods of controlling the rhinoceros beetles in oil palm plantations have used

.

employed. These methods include culture practice such as destruction of breeding sites,

ground cover crop, manual hand picking and application of chemical like Furadan

(Carbofuran), Cypermethrin and pheromone trap. Adult beetles "*"rg. from the breeding sites and need to feed in order to gain energy before becoming mature sexually (3-4

weeks). Commonly, the adult attacks the palms nearest to the breeding site. Thus, palms

(j

nearby chipping trunks have the high-risk of being attacked. Hence, such incidences may

have been the results of specific agronomic and land preparation practice during

replanting, such as chipping of oil palm trunks, underplanting and the use/disposal of empty fruit bunches (EFB), which increase the risks of associating numerous suitable breeding sites with vulnerable palms (Chung er. ol., 1991). Wood et al., (1973)

considered that the yield losses in the first 18 months of harvest from badly damaged

-

palms were relatively small. Previous studies had reported that the efficacy of the three

JJ

dosages of insecticide Marshal 5G (12 gftrms, 6 g, and 3 g) over l-2 years oil palms. The
results of the studies showed the insecticides were significantly different with the
Naphthalene balls, manual handpicking and untreated (Christa et al., 1997). Ho (19S8) stated that controlled release formulation of Carbosulfan (at 20 glpalm) was most cost-
efflective treafinent, with one application provided six months control in young oil palms.
Toh and Brown (1978) found that Carbofuran granules in the base of the spears would both protect palms and reduce the beetles population in the locality. This measure has been widely used for prophylactic control in young oit palms. Application rates of 14-28
- g (0.5 1 oz) Furadan 3G per palm, applied at 4-6 weeks interval, appear to bring about a
marked decline in the incidence of damage (Chung et. al., 1991). Gurmit, (1987) reported
the significant control Naphthalene balls in controlling Oryctes in heavily infested
coconut and oil palm replants. Applications were most effective, giving more than 95 per cent control, followed by dust or granular formulations of BHC and Carbofuran. Such
informations were expected to enhance leads towards more detailed studies on
application insecticides as safer altematives for the control of rhinoceros beetles. Some researchers stated the effectiveness of some insecticides to n control rhinoceros beetles in fields (Toh and Brown, 1978; Ho, 1988; Chung et. a1.,199; Christa et a1.,1997; Gurmit, 1997). The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of insecticides and their phytotoxicity
to immature palms.
34

3.2 Materials and Methods
The study was conducted in FELDA Plantation, Lepar Utara 14, Pahang, Malaysia. The
trial was carried in immature oil palms (1-2 years) (Tissue culture seedlings). The
treatment is shown in table 3.1. Each replicate of a treatment has 20 palms. The study was conducted in randomized complete block design (RCBD) (Tables 3.1,3.2).
First applications of insecticides were done after the pre-treatments count of palm
damages (Table 3.3) and continued at 1, 2,3, 4, and 5 months after application (MAA)
except Naphthalene balls were applied every 2 weeks interval for 5 months. All Insecticides were applied by using the ice-cream plastic (0.04 x lYz" x 14") around to the
crown of the leaves and fronds. Observations on new leaf/frond damages on the palm were carried out every two weeks up to 20 weeks. Short and long-term phytotoxicity and
beetles dead/live count were observed and noted. Statistical analysis was carried out on
new leaflfrond damaged, dead count beetles, and phyotoxicity to evaluate the efficacy of all the treated. Further analysis by used rukey HSD test was carried out (p < 0.05). (_,t

3.3 RESULTS
(i) Efficacy in 20 weeks of treatment.
Table 3.4 showed the efficacy of several insecticides against Oryctes rhinoceros in immature oil palm (Tissue culture-planting materials). Palms treated by 12 grams, 6 grams, and 3 grams Marshal 5G, 30 grams Furadan 3G and Mothballs showed some reduction on damages by RB in the later part of treatment (Week 4, 10, 12 and,20) and
significantly different from untreated (control). On Week 2 andWeek 6 treated patms by 12 grams Marshal 5G and 30 grams Furadan 3G were significantly different from untreated (control). On week 18 after application,12 grams Marshal 5G has showed the 0% damage for all blocks or replicates.
Overall, a Marshal 5G 12 gram is the most effective than the other treatments but it had the highest number of palms scorched (Figure 1) (Table 3.5). However it has the highest numbers of dead beetles found followed by Marshal 5G 6 grams, Furadan 3G 30 grams
and Marshal 5G 3 grams (Table 3.6). lz giams, 6 grams, and 3 grams Marshal 5G
(
showed the best reduction of damages by (Figure l). The damage levels were below l0olo
damages after l0 Week of applications. This indeed demonstrated the reduction of
damage percentages caused by rhinoceros beetles at the end of the treatments due to the efficacy of Marshal5G.

(ii) Phytotoxicity on oil palm treated.
The results are sunmarized in Table 3.5. Palms that received granular treatment of Marshal 5G 12 grams and 6 gftrms (Carbosulfan) were scorched at the treated portion after the first round of treatment. Fifty-eight palms were scorched by Marshal 5G 12 grams and 21 palms by Marshal 5G 6 grams. After second application, 12 palms for
Marshal 5G 12 grams and l0 palms for Marshal 5G 6 grams were scorched. The
symptom of scorching disappeared after the 6th week application. Marshal 5G (3 grams), Furadan 3G (30 grams) and Mothbalts (6 balls) granular treatments did not cause any visible symptom of scorching.
(iii) Effect of 5 chemical treatments for control of rhinoceros beetles (RB) in
immature oil palms.

More dead beetles were detected in plots with the more effective treatments. However,

these numbers do not correlate closely to occurrence of damage, but indicating the

(i

relative effectiveness of treafinents in actual killing of the beetles. Table 3.6 showed that

12 grams Marshal 5G (M5G) treated palms from week 2 trntil week 20 have killed 122

rhinoceros beetles adults. Numbers of dead beetles on pahn were reduced at the end of

applications. Meanwhile, Naphthalene balls acted as a repellent for insects and did not

cause mortality to RB.

3.4 DISCUSSIONS
This study was conducted in 4 hectares tissue culture seedlings planted. At present, the
age palm was more than 2 years. Some of the palms werebreeding sites already
producing fruit bunches, male and female inflorescences. This plot have encountered serious damaged by rhinoceros beetles. The usual Lepar utara 14 estate practice in controlling RB is the cyclic treatments to the palms by Cypermethrin and Furadan 3G in rotation for one-month interval. Pre-assessment'was done on the day before the first applications. The pre-assessment has showed the critical damaged (Slight and Severe)
were more than 50% in each replicate (Block l: 5}Yo;Block 2: ll}Yo;Block 3 :75%o
d Block 4:75Vo). Applications of the granular insecticides was easy to handle, safer to
the applicator and accurate applications.
Beetles activities in field showed by Figure 1. The up and down damage percentages
showed that the beetles populations in field were attacking the palms. The beetle
population suddenly reduced in the end of experiment including control plots. That is the population of beetles in area was decreasing. Thus we can reduce beetle population and
damage percentages (Table 3.6) if the treatments are continued for a long term.
Meanwhile, numbers of dead beetles on palm were red.uced at the end of applications showing the affect of chemical to the feeding activities of rhinoceros beetles. Dead beetles were found either on top spear or based of palms. Sometime 3-5 dead beetles
were observed in the same palm in the interval two weeks (Table 3.6).

CHAPTER 4

STT]DY ON ORYCTES RHINOCEROS IN THE DECOMPOSING
TRTINKS IN A NEW REPLANTING AREA

Objectives: To investigate the rotting of palm chip ages/times in relation to the

abundance and to find the life duration of Oryctes rhinoceros in a new replanted area.
Two types of study sites were identifred; A: Zero burning and B: Partial burning.

Sampling was done by random in 40 hectares where each sampling has 9/m2lsampling

(,

samples to run in for each type.

4.1 Introduction

With the new directive from the Department of Environment (DOE) on the environment,

open burning activities are prohibited in order to avoid excessive release of smoke, which

has a major effect on the air quality and visibility in the area undergoing replanting

Khalid et. al., 2002). The policy of zero buming for replanting oil palm is currently

considered desirable since it minimizes air and water pollution and may also enable the

(i;

development of more economically sustainable practices based on nutrient supply from

organic maffer management (Mohd Hashim et. al., 1993). Replanting of oil patm is

normally carried out after about 20-25 years due to the harvesting problem and other

economic considerations. Heong (1981) observed that the pest infestation of RB was

often related with the availability of the breeding sites. In Malaysi4 the zero buming bans

encouraged the explosion abundance of rhinoceros beetles due to the existing of oil palrns

residues that were left to rct in situ thus chipping the crop residues into small pieces (+10

45

(
(_-

cm) and avoiding a thick pile formation of the residues is recommended to reduce the
breeding sites and outbreaks of RB.
Oil palm residues take 3-4 years to rot completely. Within these periods, young oil palms were exposed to many pests especially by Oryctes rhinocreros. The nutrients released from the biodegradation of the palm residue, partly supply the total nutrients required by
the young palms in subsequent years. In special cases, where open burning is still
practiced because of pest and disease problems, the palm biomass is left to dry before burning. However, law requires prior permission from the DOE before burning allowed
(Khalid et. a1.,2002).
Larvae of RB, like many others of the subfamily Dynastinae, feed on heaps of decaying organic matter. When feeding is completed, the larvae pupate and later emerge as adult beetles. Adult of rhinoceros beetles feed on the growing leaf tissue of young palms. The
incursion will lead the disaster to the oil palm cultivation and if it becomes severe palms can be stunted or die. Outbreak of RB infestation in oil palm from rhinoceros beetles
resulted after the implementation of a zero buming technique environmental policy in the 1990's (Ho, 1996; Wahid et. a1.,2000). Palms in replanting areas are especially at risk because the decaying logs of the former stand of oil palm provide breeding ground of the larvae, which develop in rotting organic material (Wood, 1968). Beetles are athacted to organic matter in the early stages of trunk decomposition, where gravid female beetles lay eggs, in which the larvae to feed in the decomposed trunk.

46

Besides decaying oil palm trunks, the beetle also breeds in other decomposing materials, such as coconut trunks, woods, sawdust, Pandanus trunks, cocoa pod shells, cattle dung, paddy straw, rubber stumps, failed oil palm female inflorescence, leaf axils filled with
humid organic wastes and empty oil palm fruit bunch (EFB) heaps (Cumber, 1957;
Burlow and Chew, 1970; Bedford, 1976c; Dhileepan, 19Sg).

The Lepar Utara 05 estate started the partial burning at random in 496 hectares replanting

area. This contributed different environmental conditions to rhinoceros beetles. Beside to

('

investigate the rotting age of palm chip for optimum life cycle and the abundances of

Oryctes rhinoceros in a new replanted area, the study will also discuss the sifuation on

decomposing trunks in two environmental conditions i) Zero burning, and ii) Partial

buming.

4.2 Materials and Methods
4.2,1 Location of Samplings
(-;
The study was carried out on 40 hectares of heaps of chipping trunks to investigate the abundances and the rotting ages of palm chip for optimum life cycle of Oryctes at Lepar
Utara 05 for 16 Months (June 2004 - September 2005). Study sites include all types of
topographies which consists of hilltop, hillside, and roadsideo border to mature palms, and swamps and valleys.
47

4.2.2 Sampling Procedures

The evaluations of the optimum life cycle of Oryctes rhinoceros in a new replanted area were initiated from a subplot measuring 40 hectares for 16 months. Two type of study
sites were identified; A: Zerc burning and B: partial buming (Appendix l). Sampling
was done at random in 40 hectares, in which each sampling has 9 lln-4sampling samples
to run at fortnightly interval per month.

(.'

Mechanical method by a hoe and manually handpicking were used to collect stages of

rhinoceros beetles. Total of number of difFerent stages of beetle in decomposing heaps

were recorded in-situ (Appendix 2) and were identifred immediately by researchers

before eradicated. Some specimens were taken to the laboratory for future study. Two-

way ANOVA (without replication) was carried out with number of Oryctes of different

stages in zero burning trunks sampling, and partial burning trunks and month after felling
& chipping (MAF). Analyses were performed on the log transformation for numbers of

Oryctes stage in the decomposing trunks.

Li
4.3 Results

For the period of 16 months sampling of rhinoceros beetle immature in the decomposing
trunks; the trunks and stem roots contained the high numbers of abundances of O.
rhinoceros. The highest number of beetle stage that was regularly found in trunk chipping was the third and second instar larvae. While the pupal and prepupal was easily observed
48

in all parts especiatly in decomposing fronds and deep in the ground (one foot). This phenomenon was clearly depicted in the numbers of the Oryctes in the decomposing
trunks (Figure 4.1.A & 4.1.B). Based on the observation, we can easily detect the
immature stage by the feces in the chip and the condition of trunks especially for larvae of second and third instar (Appendix 5).

The study was carried out in the area which was almost entirely chipped completely and

felled for three months ago before samplings was caried out. tn the 3 months after felling

(

and chipping (MAF), 4 MAF and 5 MAF showed no Oryctes stages were found both on

sites. But, on the 6 MAF in the zero burning (Figure 4.1.A), the numbers of newly

emerged adult were 0.1 adulVm2/sampling (Mss-'; aud partial buming (Figwe 4.1.B)

increasing especially for second instars and third instars larvae. Peak numbers recorded

were 13.5 of third instars larvae in the sample of the partial burning area in April 2005,

13 months after felling and chipping (MAF) (Figure 4.1.B). Figure 4.2 shows the

(-,

density of the third and second instars larva where both instars were highest in numbers

during 13 MAF with 12.5 individual per m2 of third instars and 9.9 individuat per m2 of

second instars. Abundance of Oryctes were more significant after 9 MAF with 0.3 larrae

first instar, 1.3 larvae second instar, 0.3 larvae third instar, 0 for prepupae and pupae, and

0.2 adults per rn2.

49

During 8 MAF, we only found larvae from second instars wtth}.2lm2- Meanwhile, eggs

were only found with 1.3 and 1.4 per m2 in 15 MAF and 16 MAf,', respectively. The

dominations of immature stages in decomposing trunks continued until 18 MAF during

the fortnightly sampling. At least, on two occasions the beetle egg were observed during

15 MAF and 16 MAF with the high nurnbers was 13 eggs/m2lsampling (MSS-') in 16

MAF. As mentioned earlier, the first detection of Oryctes immatures started in 6 MAF

with 0.3 larvae from third instar, 0.1 prepupae, 0.1 pupae and 0.4 adults, respectively

(Figure 4.1.B). While, eggs were detected in 13 MAF and it was the only month that all

(l

stages of Oryctes were present with mean numbers of 2.7 eggs, 8.0 larvae first instar, 8.0

larvae second instar, 13.5 larvae from third instar, 1.0 prepupae, 2.1 pupae and 0.4 adults,

respectively. The highest number of eggs was observed in 13 MAF which was 24

eggs/m2lsampling (MSS-t). Eggs were also observed in 15 MAF with mean number 0.1.

of 18 months after felling and chipping. Overall, in the 3, 4 and 5 MAF no beetles were found' However, at 6 MAF RB immature started to appear in the rotting trunk chips with a
total 3 larvae from third instar, I prepupae, I pupae, and 5 adults, respectively (Appendix
3). Started from 6 MAF, a significant of immature beetle population in the rotting trunks
appeared. It was indicating that a big immigration of adults especially gravid beetles
occurred. Almost every month the first instar and the numbers of second and third inskrs were continuously observed in the samples. About 161 second instar larvae and 235 third instars were found in 13 MAF where the number is high.

While, Wood, (2001) stated that sometimes ground vegetation e.g.: Mucuna bracteata prevent the breeding of RB. During 12 MAF we sampled the RB immatures in the rotting heaps covered by Assytasia sp. (weed) and. Mucuna bracteata (cover crop) (see Figures 4.2 and 4.3). A trunk if is totally covered by cover crops caused difficulty in the sampling and hinderer the RB adults to lay eggs in the decomposing trunks.

(\,.'

There was a significant difference in numbers of RB immatures between months after

felling and chipping (MAF) (Fts,rer+: 11.931, P< 0.05) and of RB immatures beetle stages

: (Fo'tssa 25-313, P< 0.05X Appendix 4.i). While zero burning and partial buming

definitely show a significant difference between beetles numbers evaluated (Fr,rrs :3.967,

P< 0.05X Appendix 4. ii).

4.4 Discussion
Norman (2001) found that the Oryctes rhinoceros immatures were still detected in the heaps up to more than two years (at 26 months after replanting). Beetles were attracted by the volatile compounds produced through the decay of the organic matter, and also the beetles produce an aggregation pheromone, ethyl-4 methyloctanoate which can be used to trap beetles ofboth sexes (Jackson et a1.,2003\.

Immature stages were most in danger in the beetle life cycle based on its habitats. Besides other insect predator, immature beetles are preyed upon by the ground animals such mammals Rattus'tiomanicus, R. argiventus, and pig and reptile for examples snakes, and iguana. Larvae of third instar are most vulnerable to predators because it's big size and
has a long life cycle (16l.l days; based on Norman, 2001).-

Trunks heap need to be burn 4 -5 times for complete buming and that is why DOE

(;

limited the activities on buming of the heaps (Turner, et. al., 2001). In this study of

partial burning of heap was carried on the out layer only. This did not help to prevent the

Oryctes to lay the eggs or reduced the breeding sites. But the immatures increased after 6

MAF and showed positive for eggs, larvae of first instar, larvae of second instar, larvae of

third instar, prepupae, pupae and adults, respectively. The immatures of RB were present

I in the decomposing trunks in the 6 MAF with 0. adult/m2lsampling (MSg-'y Girst

generation) in the zero buming area. Meanwhile, in partial burning areas, the larvae of

55

third instar started to appear in the rotting trunks in the 6 MAF. Based on Catley (1969),
Chrurg (2003), Hinckley (1973) and Bedfofi (1976a, b) stated the third instar larvae of Oryctes rhinoceros can be observed between 3.2 - 6 months after eggs being laid. The present of RB immature stages continued up to 17 MAF and majority Oryctes stages
found in the decomposing trunks were the second and third instar larvae were in high
numbers. From the observation, third instar larvae can be found up to two feet deep in the ground. Basal stem and upper stem have been found to provide more immature stages especially third instar larvae and pupae. Crown or frond of palm only provide breeding
sites for the prepupal and pupal stage.

Some immafure stages were brought to laboratory for further study. Externally, Oryctes

can be sexed on pupae stage by examined the dorsal head. The head of the female pupae
has a short horn, while the male pupae has a long horn but it not that accurate if compared in sexually matured beetles where the tip of the female abdomen has a tuff of

velvet shiny bristles. Young pupae contained white liquid before the adult develops from

(_l

the pupal cell. Unidentifred ectoparasites were found on extemal surfaces of all stages

beetles except eggs. These insects maybe parasitizing the Oryctes but their status are not

known. Mutry of them were observed on the cocoon of prepupae or pupae.

Nevertheless, there is not different between the abundances or numbers of Oryctes found between (A) zero burning and (B) partial burning. Both of types (A and B) showed that
the rotting palm chips have high population of Oryctes rhinoceros in replanting area

56

started from 6 months after felling and chipping (Appendix 4). Ten to thirty MAF were the ages of palm chip optimum for breeding of Oryctes rhinoceros in replanted area. i['hels, pag"{fai i:txn'ning sltou}$ be s6*pp*d" Zero fuurnnrag i+}:,c}u?d be grraetieer} tS[}c&,.
