The Guam Invasive Species Master Plan prioritizes the control and removal of these pests. Pacific Daily News

Many people know about the ecological disaster caused by the brown tree snake, which killed almost all forest birds on Guam during the last century. Not only did we lose the birds, but also the ecosystem services they provided, such as spreading seeds, eating insect pests and pollinating some plants.

However, few people are aware of the current ecological disaster. Our forests are rapidly being killed by invasive insects.

In 2002, a U.S. Forest Service survey estimated the total number of trees with a stem diameter of greater than five inches in Guam's forests. According to the survey, the three most populous trees were Guam's endemic cycad, fadang (16 percent of total), coconut palm (12 percent), and palma brava (11 percent).

These three prominent species, accounting for 39 percent of all trees in Guam's forests, are being killed at an alarming rate by uncontrolled invasive insects.
Most abundant tree on Guam

Fadang evolved in Micronesia and was perfectly suited for survival on Guam, being resistant to typhoons and drought. This is why it was the most abundant tree on Guam for thousands if not millions of years.

That began to change when a tiny insect pest, the Asian cycad scale, was found on ornamental cycads in Tumon in 2003. They live under a white, waxy scale cover and live by sucking sap from cycads. Without treatment, cycads become totally covered with scales and start to die within a year.

The first plants to die were the ornamental plants in Tumon, but the infestation quickly spread to wild plants. Surveys indicated that 90 percent of fadang plants were killed by the cycad scale and other recently arrived invasive insects. Fadang was added to the U.S. endangered species list in 2015.

Introduction of a lady beetle that eats the cycad scale is protecting mature fadang plants, but the remaining plants aren’t reproducing because all seedlings are still being killed.
Coconut rhinoceros beetle

Coconut palm and palma brava, formerly the second- and third-most abundant trees in Guam's forests, are being killed by coconut rhinoceros beetles, first discovered in Tumon in 2007. Adult beetles damage palms when they bore into crowns to feed on sap. When beetles bore through developing fronds within the crown, this results in distinctive V-shaped cuts when the fronds emerge.

Occasionally, beetles will kill palms by damaging the growing tip within the crown. This usually happens only when a palm is attacked by many beetles during an outbreak. Immature beetles, referred to as grubs, do no damage because they feed only on dead plant material. The favored feeding site for grubs is a dead, standing coconut.

An attempt was made to eradicate the beetle from Guam. But this failed when the beetle spread to all parts of the island by 2010. There was little tree mortality until abundant beetle breeding sites in the form of decaying vegetation were left in the wake of Typhoon Dolphin in 2015. Large numbers of beetles from these breeding sites began to kill palms.

Guam is now in the midst of an uncontrolled, self-sustaining outbreak whereby dead standing coconuts generate large numbers of adults, which kill more palms, resulting in even more adults. This feedback cycle will not stop until the beetles have exhausted their food supply, resulting in death of most palms on Guam.
Viral disease does not work on Guam

Entomologists have attempted to stop the outbreak by introducing disease organisms. Unfortunately, a viral disease which provided long-lasting population control when released on many Pacific islands does not work with the Guam population. It turns out that beetle on Guam is a newly discovered virus-resistant biotype of the pest.

This super beetle is not just a problem on Guam. Coconuts and other palms are being killed in Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Palau, Oahu and Rota. Pacific-based entomologists are scrambling to find virus isolates which can be used to control the super beetles.

The tree snake killed the birds in Guam's forests. Now invasive insects are killing the three most abundant tree species in these forests.
