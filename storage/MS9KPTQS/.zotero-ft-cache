Traditionally, native Hawaiians firmly believe that land and ocean are one and that together they provide everything needed for man to survive. Therefore, it is our kuleana (responsibility) to steward the land so that it may provide the necessary resources for generations to come. We would like to start by first acknowledging our kupuna (ancestors), who were the original land stewards and who helped to lay the foundation, teaching us by example to malama (care for) all that sustains life.
We also acknowledge the current land stewards who work tirelessly to continue the work of those who came before us. This group, represented by the many hands in agriculture, ranching, aquaculture, and nurseries and by conservationists throughout the state, is committed to protecting the natural and cultural resources that sustain their industries and our local water and food sources. As a community, we must support these industries and protect them from the harmful effects of invasive species. We believe that the Hawaii Interagency Biosecurity Plan is a necessary tool to support these industries.
This plan was conscientiously developed through extensive participation from members of the public and private sectors and the larger community. They provided invaluable input during development of the Hawaii Interagency Biosecurity Plan. We would like to acknowledge the following public and private sector agencies and organizations that participated in the stakeholder workshops.

Definition of Key Terms

Term Aquatic invasive species Biosecurity Border
Foreign animal disease Interception
Invasive species
Pacific Regional States and Countries Pathway

Definition
A nonindigenous aquatic species that, if introduced into an ecosystem, may cause harm to Hawaii’s economy, environment, human health, or public safety and welfare.
The set of measures taken to manage the risk from invasive species to the economy, environment, and health and lifestyle of the people.
Encompasses all the policies, protocols, and processes put in place to detect and respond to the arrival of an invasive species at the ports of entry (into the state) or at the regulated place of entry (into the state). The border is the area bounded either by the inspection areas (inside the walls or inside the fence) at ports of entry from mainland or foreign countries or by the extent of regulations governing importation from mainland or foreign countries. It is a very confined physical area/area of responsibility. Anything that is not covered by import regulations or is found outside the physical boundary of the port is “postborder.” “Border” would include facilities that are mandated (by border regulations) to deal with goods as if they are at the border, including off-site inspection facilities, containment facilities, plant quarantine facilities. “Border” is about facilities, regulations and inspection.
An important transmissible livestock or poultry disease believed to be absent from the United States and its territories that has a potential significant health or economic impact. Diseases may be emerging diseases or internationally recognized diseases that are endemic in countries outside the United States.
The finding of a pest associated with a commodity or a shipping container. A single commodity infested with various species of insects is a single interception, but after it is determined to have multiple species, each species is associated with the interception on which it was originally found. If three different species of insects are found in the shipment, then it is logged as three interceptions. There may be one or many individuals of each of the three species, but they are logged as only three interceptions. These three insect species may be on the same commodity or on different commodities in the same shipment. If the same insect species are found in a different shipment on the same day, they are regarded as three separate interceptions.i
An alien species whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health. This is the federal definition of invasive species from Executive Order 13112. Invasive species is a nonregulatory term, and the state has several regulatory designations that are related to but not synonymous with the term, including pest, noxious weed, and injurious wildlife.
For aquatic invasive species ballast water and hull fouling coordination, Pacific regional states and countries include Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Australia, and New Zealand.
The means by which an invasive species is transported from one location to another. Movement of species can be via natural pathways, which include wind, water, or attachment to animals, or via pathways enhanced or created by human activity.ii Movement of species via human-made pathways can be unintentional (e.g., associated with the importation of fruits

and vegetables) and intentional (i.e., the result of deliberate actions to translocate organisms).
As defined by Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 150A, “any animal, insect, disease agent or other organism in any stage of development that is detrimental or potentially harmful to agriculture, or horticulture, or animal or public health, or natural resources including native biota or has an adverse effect on the environment.”
The area that a pest is found in once it has passed the point or opportunity of border inspection, whether it was or was not detected. Postborder encompasses all the policies, protocols, and processes put in place to eradicate or control an invasive species beyond the ports of entry and inspection process. The issue of interisland biosecurity and transport of species within an island is covered under the theme of postborder security.
Encompasses all the policies, processes, and protocols put in place to prevent entry of an invasive species into Hawaii.
Is discussed in several places in this document in the following contexts: pest risk analysis; pest risk assessment; biosecurity risk; or high-risk pest, species, taxa, commodity, or pathway. Simply put, risk is the chance of an adverse event happening and the consequences if it happens. Risk analysis is a systematic way of gathering, evaluating, and recording information leading to recommendations for a position or action in response to an identified hazard. Pest risk analysis is a form of risk analysis conducted by regulatory plant health authorities like the various countries’ national plant protection organizations, U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) as a systematical approach to decide whether a pest should be allowed to enter (a country, region, or state) or managed using legislation. Pest risk analyses identify appropriate phytosanitary measures to protect plants against new or emerging pests.iii IPPC defines Pest risk analysis as “the process of evaluating biological or other scientific and economic evidence to determine whether a pest should be regulated and the strength of any phytosanitary measures to be taken against it.”iv IPPC’s Pest risk analysis is a formal three-step process that involves:
1. hazard identification (what is the adverse event that we are afraid will happen?),
2. risk assessment (what information is available, what is the quality and quantity of information, what is the probability, and what is the magnitude of consequences?), and
3. risk management (what can be done to eliminate the hazard, how feasible and effective are the options, what impacts do the options have, and what is the level or type of uncertainty?).
Hawaii Department of Agriculture (HDOA) in general follows the widely accepted science-based international guidelines on risk analysis. There is no state policy that mandates HDOA to adopt a specific pest risk analysis framework. For example, the Kahului Airport Risk Assessmentv adopted the general guidelines for conducting pest risk assessments in the report titled, Generic Non-Indigenous Pest Risk Assessment Process.vi Data gathered by HDOA during its regular and heightened inspections relative to which pests are being intercepted, which commodities they are found in, what the port of origin of the commodities in which the pest was intercepted is, and so on are used to analyze the risk associated with an identified hazard, which

Section 1.0 Vision

Hawaii’s people, visitors, economy, agriculture, and natural environment are protected from the impacts of invasive species.
With strong leadership across all partner agencies, legislative support, and a commitment to fund the implementation tasks identified in this Hawaii Interagency Biosecurity Plan (HIBP), biosecurity by 2027 is envisioned to contribute to a wide range of positive outcomes for Hawaii’s economy, its environment, and the health and lifestyle of its people. We will know biosecurity is working when:
1. Farmers, ranchers, aquaculturists, and plant nursery growers experience reduced risk to production, broaden local and export markets, and receive effective support to detect and control pests.
2. Commodities shipped to Hawaii are cleaner, with less pest contamination, because agreements with other state, federal, and international authorities have produced better prevention strategies, such as offshore screening and certification of commodities.
3. Border inspection of higher-risk items is more efficient and lower-risk items are released more quickly because the Hawaii Department of Agriculture (HDOA) uses state-of-the-art data management systems, electronic manifesting (emanifesting), and enhanced intelligence gathering.
4. The chance of pests entering Hawaii is reduced because HDOA has the authority to inspect nonagricultural commodities it determines to be of higher risk.
5. Hawaii’s primary industries are more secure because an increase in HDOA staffing allows for increased border inspection; more data gathering to inform risk assessments; and increased postborder support to local agricultural, aquaculture, and landscape industries to manage risks from invasive species.
6. Inspection efficiency improves because HDOA has inspection facilities that are secured, well lit, and equipped with the tools to detect, contain, treat, and destroy infected materials.
7. Human diseases, such as dengue, Zika, and rat lungworm disease, pose a lower risk because the fully restored Vector Control Branch of the Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) is better able to detect vectors of disease before they become a human health hazard.
8. Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) are less likely to arrive and spread by means of ballast water or by attaching to the hull of vessels because specific regulations and best management practices are in place to protect Hawaii’s waters.
9. Invasive algae and other established AIS are effectively contained and controlled by applying improved control technologies and enhanced efforts to control and monitor their distribution.

10. HDOA’s biocontrol program has adequate resources, including state-of-the-art biocontrol facilities, and is equipped to develop effective biocontrol for some of Hawaii’s high-impact and widespread invasive species that are difficult to control through conventional methods.
11. Natural resources, including native biodiversity, are better protected on public and private lands because established invasive species are effectively controlled and reduced.
12. Incipient invasive species are detected and eradicated in a timely manner on public and private lands because the capacity for early detection and rapid response has increased.
13. Invasive species are less likely to spread from one island to another because multiple mechanisms are in place, such as monitoring for early detection, adequate rapid response capacity, keeping better records, increasing the number of inspections, and implementing interisland nursery certification and pest treatment programs.
14. Hawaii’s residents take pride in our biosecurity system, recognize it as an essential service, are more knowledgeable about the islands’ biosecurity system, and support and engage in activities that improve it.
Expected Overall Changes:
1. Hawaii’s unique biosecurity needs are addressed at the local, national, and international level.
2. Federal agencies recognize Hawaii’s unique biosecurity challenges and take specific actions to implement more protective federal biosecurity program measures and assist with federal preemption issues.
3. Biosecurity is better understood as the shared responsibility of many agencies and partners coordinating their work on preborder, border, and postborder issues across multiple sectors.
4. Agencies are aligned with the biosecurity vision, they are fully committed to and accountable for delivering on their tasks, and efforts to manage invasive species from preborder to postborder are well coordinated and effective.
5. Hawaii’s current and emerging biosecurity risks are better understood by private industry stakeholders and the public, and both of these groups are engaged in developing solutions to biosecurity threats to the islands
6. Agencies have the necessary policy, funding, expertise, and staffing to deliver on their biosecurity responsibilities.
7. State-of-the-art technology and infrastructure are available to protect Hawaii from the impact of invasive species.

Section 2.0 Introduction

2.1 Need for and Purpose of the Hawaii Interagency Biosecurity Plan
In 2001, the Hawaii legislature found that “the silent invasion of Hawaii by alien invasive species is the single greatest threat to Hawaii’s economy, natural environment, and the health and lifestyle of Hawaii’s people and visitors” (Senate Concurrent Resolution 45, H.D. 1 [2001]). Although many governmental organizations and Nongovernmental Organizations (NGOs) implement components of biosecurity through several invasive species management and research programs, Hawaii has not addressed its unique biosecurity needs in a coordinated and comprehensive manner. Three primary factors are highly relevant here: (1) Hawaii is extremely vulnerable to biological invasions; (2) the spectrum of dominant endemic/native plant species in Hawaii differs from that found in the rest of the United States; and (3) Hawaii imports more than 80% of all its goods and approximately 90% of its food (HDOT 1997, Lueng and Loke 2008).

Hawaii’s susceptibility to invasions is

dramatically illustrated by the fact that nearly

as many nonnative terrestrial arthropod

species are established in Hawaii as in the

other 49 states of the United States

combined. How can this be possible, and

why is it the case? A consultant’s report to

the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)

(McGregor 1973) recognized that innate

characteristics of Hawaii seem to make

agricultural quarantine more difficult: “[For

Shipping routes (yellow lines) highlight that Hawaii (circled in red) is a major transportation hub in the Pacific. Incoming ships bring not only goods we depend on but also harmful pests from all over the world. Faster and larger means of transportation over the years have dramatically increased the rate of nonnative species reaching Hawaii.

insects and mites] in the period 1942–72 the rate of colonization per thousand square miles was 40 species, 500 times the rate of continental United States,” in spite of a larger quarantine force in relation to volume of

commerce. He speculated on possible reasons: “Although there is much greater diversity of crops and habitats

within the continental United States, these are dispersed over a vastly larger land area. In Hawaii . . . the various

habitats are more readily accessible from the principal port of entry. The more moderate and stable climate is

also more favorable for an invading species than is the climate over much of the United States.”

The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) (DeNitto et al. 2015) spent 4 years responding admirably to the Hawaii Division of Forestry and Wildlife’s (DOFAW’s) request to analyze the risk to 13 Hawaiian species/genera that dominate our ecosystems and provide habitat for the rest of Hawaii’s biota, including most threatened and endangered species. The agency documented many threats to those species/genera from invasive species not yet present in

Hawaii. With the combination of such impending threats and the islands’ extreme vulnerability to biological invasions (discussed above), Hawaii needs to actively pursue more protection from interstate and international threats.

Hawaii should protect itself much better than it currently does. It is common practice to import propagative plant material to Hawaii for finishing and resale because it is much cheaper than selfpropagation. At the same time, importation of propagative plant material is recognized as one of the main pathways for the introduction of pests such as coqui frogs (Eleutherodactylus coqui), nettle caterpillar (Darna pallivitta), ohia rust (Puccinai psidii) and Rapid Ohia Death (Ceratocystis fimbriata) (Burnett and Coffman 2015, DeNitto et al. 2015, Rago and Sugano 2015). To mitigate the risk associated with importing propagative plant materials, HDOA could enhance import requirements by requiring phytosanitary certificates for host plants.

Agricultural inspectors examine imported cut flowers. Importation of plant material is one of the main pathways for the introduction of harmful pests and diseases. (Source: HDOA)

USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), are primarily responsible for intercepting pests from foreign points of origin. HDOA is the first line of defense against invasive species entering our state from domestic points of origin, and as discussed in Section 2.2, it is the only state agency mandated to implement a biosecurity program. However, the impact of invasive species in Hawaii is wide ranging, so in addition to HDOA, several federal, state, and county agencies and nonprofit organizations are working to prevent the entry of invasive species into Hawaii and the spread of these species in the state.

The following agencies and organizations are among those focused primarily on biosecurity issues in Hawaii:

The Hawaii Department of Agriculture (HDOA) is mandated to implement Hawaii’s biosecurity program. The Plant Industry (PI) and Animal Industry (AI) Divisions are primarily involved in implementing this program. The PI Division plays an important role in inspecting cargo and passengers at all ports of entry for the importation of potentially harmful pests and regulates the importation and possession of nondomestic animals and microorganisms. Through its Plant Quarantine (PQ) Branch, Plant Pest Control (PPC) Branch, and Pesticides Branch, the PI Division also protects Hawaii’s agricultural industries, natural resources, and the public from the entry and establishment of detrimental plants, animals, insects, weeds, plant diseases, and other pests. In addition, it ensures the safe and efficient use of pesticides in Hawaii. The PI

Division also promotes expansion of Hawaii’s agriculture and horticulture by overcoming quarantine restrictions. The AI Division safeguards the state’s livestock and poultry industries by controlling and preventing the entry and spread of livestock pests and diseases; operating the rabies quarantine program and the airport holding facility; conducting investigations into violations of animal quarantine or animal importation statutes; and providing veterinary laboratory support for diagnosing animal diseases.
The Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) is the state agency mandated to enhance, protect, conserve, and manage Hawaii’s unique and limited natural, cultural, and historic resources held in public trust. DLNR, primarily through DOFAW and the Division of Aquatic Resources (DAR), administers various programs for the management of established invasive species in Hawaii’s natural areas.
The Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) is the state agency with the mission to protect and improve the health and environment for all the people in Hawaii. DOH through its Vector Control Branch works with other state and federal partners to ensure that human diseases and vectors of those diseases do not become established in the islands.
The University of Hawaii (UH) supports biosecurity primarily through academic research and cooperative extension services. UH’s College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources (CTAHR) Cooperative Extension Services (CES) is a partnership among federal, state, and local governments and has responsibility for providing sciencebased information and educational programs in agriculture, natural resources, and human resources. CTAHR CES programs address home and garden projects, commercial agriculture, natural resources, soils, and invasive species and pest control. Extension agents and specialists directly support local farmers, aquaculturists, floriculturists, and others with research, survey, detection, and management of pest infestations. CES programs also provide agricultural diagnostic services, which include insect identification; disease diagnosis; soil, plant, water, and feed analysis; and support of local production through sales of seeds of vegetable and fruit cultivars developed by the college.
UH’s Pacific Cooperative Studies Unit (PCSU) also works cooperatively with private and state and federal land organizations, including The Nature Conservancy, Kamehameha Schools, and DLNR. Its projects range from finding ways to eradicate miconia (Miconia calvescens) and other alien invasive weeds to managing watersheds on Maui and Oahu. Often, PCSU works as an intermediary, allowing agencies to pool and coordinate their efforts so that they can attack problems such as invasive species across the landscape at an appropriate scale. For example, PCSU administers the various island-based Invasive Species Committees (ISCs) and the Hawaii Ant Lab (HAL), discussed below.

The mission of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), is to promote and protect the health and value of American agriculture and natural resources. The broad mission involves managing wildlife damage; regulating genetically engineered organisms; and conducting plant and animal inspection, certification, diagnosis, research, regulation (foreign trade and nationally critical domestic quarantine), national control and eradication, and international representation and leadership. APHIS Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) is the national plant protection organization member for the IPPC that establishes international standards for pest-free export, import, and shipment of materials (e.g., solid wood packaging standards were an IPPC initiative). APHIS’s Veterinary Services represent U.S. interests at the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), an organization that facilitates reporting of animal diseases; assists with execution of emergency exercises; and provides aid to poorer countries to prevent the spread of highly pathogenic animal diseases, such as avian influenza.
APHIS seeks nominations from states, counties, local groups, and individuals for plant genera to become Not Authorized Pending Pest Risk Analysis in order to reduce the pest risk of imported foreign plants. It networks with foreign offices to report pest information and reviews publications to identify emerging and encroaching pests and their new hosts. APHIS also works with the National Plant Board through various state pest regulatory agencies to:
• Ensure that international pest regulation standards are met, including criteria for individual states to retain actionable status locally even when pests are deregulated nationally or internationally
• Promote and train federal and state officers to support the system wide approach to nursery certification in order to reduce the number of pests transported during interstate trade
• Continue implementing best practices to address federal and state regulatory issues and concerns
PPQ works with each state to encourage adoption of a written plant emergency response plan. Along with other USDA operations, PPQ serves many of the Emergency Support Function #11 roles and functions regarding agriculture and natural resources to support state, local, and tribal authorities and other federal agency efforts.
Since 2003, 2,417 APHIS inspector positions, along with others, including port of entry positions, have been transferred into the DHS CBP to help enforce compliance of conveyances, foreign garbage, military and civilian movement (including preclearance of military equipment), and transit shipments with APHIS. CBP continues to collect data from these activities for analysis, pathway monitoring, and risk forecasting. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between DHS CBP and APHIS explains the work agreement. APHIS operates the plant inspection stations, diagnoses CBP interceptions, and inspects most plant shipments. Shipments, conveyances (including containers), packing material, and foreign garbage that are found to have actionable pests or that otherwise fail to meet regulations are acted on according to the responsibilities of CBP and APHIS.

States in cooperation with PPQ perform postentry quarantine of certain plants at risk of carrying diseases and other pests that may become apparent later after entry. PPQ works with HDOA, other state partners, groups, industry, and universities to provide training, public awareness, programs to promote careers in agriculture, support for local farmers to expand markets and contain pests, and preparation and administration of farm bill funding. The federal pest survey program funds and participates in pest detection. Local trapping surveillance is done by PPQ at work locations and in tandem with state personnel as needed. Fruit fly trapping personnel survey a network of traps for early detection of exotic fruit flies not known to occur in Hawaii. Export certification provides a system of trade information and certification to export local goods to foreign countries, and PPQ aids farmers through HDOA in requests for approval of new commodities to U.S. mainland markets. The PPQ biological control permitting branch recognizes Hawaii’s ecological uniqueness by requiring separate processes for approving biological control organisms for Hawaii and analysis of HDOA input.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service, Pacific Basin Agricultural Research Center (PBARC), in Hilo, Hawaii, has the mission of developing basic and applied information to strengthen agriculture in Hawaii and the Pacific Basin in an environmentally acceptable and sustainable manner, including demonstrating appropriate strategies for managing crop pests and providing economically viable technologies for controlling quarantine pests. PBARC entomologists and plant pathologists can assist in identifying, detecting, and mitigating invasive species. PBARC scientists also have expertise in quarantine treatments. The agency is making a major contribution to the response to Rapid Ohia Death.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), functions at the international ports of entry in Hawaii, screening and inspecting people and commodities for targeted pests in the United States. CBP enforces a wide range of biosecurity issues; it enforces mandates from other agencies, including APHIS, the Center for Disease Control (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration, specifically addressing domestic and nondomestic animals, produce, plants and plant parts, animal products, and foreign garbage. CBP is responsible for air/sea/military passengers/cargo and air and sea conveyance entering the United States from foreign countries. It conducts inspections and retains information relating to the entry of passengers and cargo.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service (USFS), in Hawaii consists of the Institute of Pacific Islands Forestry (an institute devoted to biodiversity and forestry research) and the Pacific Southwest Region’s State and Private Forestry programs. It is based at a facility in Hilo, Hawaii. Although USFS has no national forest land in Hawaii, it conducts research on Pacific island forest management and ecology and provides funding, technical advice, and training to Hawaii and other island forestry programs through its State and Private Forestry programs, such as Forest Health Protection and Forest Stewardship. It also supports a major biological control effort for seriously invasive weeds (including strawberry guava [Psidium cattleianum] and miconia) in Hawaii and assists state forestry programs addressing plant pests and pest plants by providing forest

health evaluations and funding in certain circumstances. USFS is heavily involved with the response to Rapid Ohia Death, caused by the pathogen Ceratocystis fimbriata.
The U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), is responsible for protecting species federally listed as endangered, migratory birds, and national wildlife refuges, which in Hawaii are threatened primarily by biological invasions. USFWS Ecological Services maintains an Invasive Species Coordinator at the Pacific Islands Field Office in Honolulu and other Hawaii-based staff members who work on invasive species issues. National wildlife refuges in Hawaii support invasive species control programs as part of their overall habitat restoration activities. USFWS has played a tremendous role in keeping the brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis) out of Hawaii by working to keep eradication and detection efforts around the airport in Guam funded.
The USFWS Office of Law Enforcement administers the Lacey Act, which prohibits the importation and interstate movement of listed injurious species. USFWS is also responsible for monitoring the import, export, transport, sale, receipt, acquisition, or purchase of any fish or wildlife, including regulated wildlife products, or plant possessed, transported, or sold in violation of any law, treaty, or regulation of the United States, as well as interstate or foreign commerce of any fish or wildlife taken, possessed, transported, or sold in violation of any law or regulation of any state or foreign law, or plants in violation of any law or regulation of any state.
The U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service (NPS), manages nine parks in Hawaii, with protection of biodiversity as a primary goal. Major program components, especially of the larger parks—Hawaii Volcanoes National Park (323,000 acres) and Haleakala National Park (33,000 acres)—address invasive species issues within and outside park boundaries. NPS also has an Exotic Plant Management Team that focuses on the control of invasive species on Park Service Refuge properties in Hawaii and U.S. Territories and Possessions in the Tropical Pacific. NPS conducts, collaborates on, and financially supports research, management, and outreach related to invasive species both within and outside parks’ terrestrial and marine boundaries.
The U.S. Department of the Interior, Geological Survey (USGS), Pacific Island Ecosystems Research Center (PIERC), provides scientific leadership in support of national, regional, and local needs to understand, conserve, and manage natural resources in Hawaii and other Pacific island ecosystems. PIERC strives to help resource managers tackle current and emerging critical conservation issues, primarily issues related to invasive species.

The Coordinating Group on Alien Pest Species (CGAPS) is a statewide coalition of agencies and NGOs working together to protect Hawaii from invasive species. CGAPS was formed in 1995 to bring agencies and organizations together to close the gaps in Hawaii’s invasive species programs in the areas of prevention, early detection/rapid response, and long-term control of harmful terrestrial species and AIS.
The Hawaii Invasive Species Council (HISC) was established in 2003 for the special purpose of providing policy-level direction, coordination, and planning among state departments, federal agencies, and international and local initiatives for the control and eradication of harmful invasive species infestations throughout the state and for preventing the introduction of other invasive species that may be potentially harmful. It is an interdepartmental collaboration composed of DLNR; DOH; HDOA; the Hawaii Department of Transportation (HDOT); the Hawaii Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism (DBEDT); and UH.
Invasive Species Committees (ISCs) are island-based coalitions of government and nongovernment entities organized under UH’s PCSU. They include the Kauai Invasive Species Committee, Oahu Invasive Species Committee, Maui Invasive Species Committee (MISC), Molokai Invasive Species Committee, and Big Island Invasive Species Committee. They provide early detection and rapid response programs to eradicate or contain newly detected invasive species before they become irreversibly established. The ISCs are well known for their strong public outreach and educate programs tailored to island issues and communities.
Hawaii Ant Lab (HAL) is a specialized invasive ant management unit attached to UH’s PCSU. HAL’s charter is to develop new ant treatment methodologies, assist affected businesses and residents, and take an operational lead in eradicating invasive ants on all Hawaii’s islands. HAL’s current focus is preventing the spread of little fire ants (Wasmannia auropunctata) and eradicating incipient populations as they are detected.
Hawaii Association of Watershed Partnerships are voluntary alliances of both public and private landowners committed to the common value of protecting forested watersheds for water recharge, conservation, and other ecosystem services through collaborative management. Controlling the introduction and spread of invasive species in Hawaii’s watersheds is a core function of the Watershed Partnerships.

What’s at Risk?
Hawaii’s agricultural production totals $680 million1 annually. The agricultural sector in Hawaii loses approximately $300 million2 each year in revenue from alien fruit fly infestations alone. Another such pest could inflict similar losses.
The value of the Koolau Mountain forest watershed alone is estimated at $14 billion3 in combined economic and ecosystem services. A disease like Rapid Ohia Death could wipe out Hawaii’s ohia trees, which are a dominant component of our native forests, thereby affecting their capacity to recharge water.
Hawaii’s annual horticultural production is estimated at $69 million1. The spread of pests, such as the chrysanthemum white rust, could result in further quarantine restrictions on exports and the in-state sale of locally produced flowers and foliage.
Visitors spend $14.9 billion4 per year in Hawaii. The outbreak of a human-health disease, such as the Zika virus, or the introduction of a nuisance pest, such as biting midges (sandflies), could devastate Hawaii’s tourism economy.
Little fire ant is estimated to cost Hawaii County alone $174 million5 per year in management costs and economic damage to agriculture, nurseries, residents, and other sectors.
The economic cost of inaction is great, but the potential reduction in quality of life and the potential loss of cultural and environmental resources are unthinkable.

The capacity of individual agencies and organizations to prevent and control invasive species is limited by their regulatory statutes, funds, staffing, expertise, and infrastructure. In spite of efforts by passionate professionals and dedicated staff members to share resources and work collaboratively, actions to solve invasive species problems in Hawaii are often delayed and inadequate, costing Hawaii taxpayers millions of dollars in otherwise preventable control work. Decades of experience with invasive species management and research in the islands, together with lessons learned from New Zealand and Australia (which already have comprehensive nationwide biosecurity systems in place), have highlighted the fact that biosecurity inherently requires the ongoing collaboration of multiple organizations working to protect agriculture, natural environment, and the health and lifestyle of the people. Lack of a cohesive interagency biosecurity plan with clearly mandated agency roles and responsibilities, and dedicated funding to effectively prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species has been identified as a critical programmatic gap in Hawaii’s efforts (TNC and NRDC 1992, Warren 2006, HISC 2015).
HDOA has taken the lead to develop this HIBP, but this plan does not recreate or revise HDOA’s existing biosecurity program delivered through its PQ Branch and described by Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 150A. This HIBP is a 10-year road map for implementing the infrastructure and capacity needed to support biosecurity programs at multiple agencies, including HDOA. A comprehensive perspective on biosecurity in Hawaii certainly includes the PQ Biosecurity Program, but it also recognizes the broader context of preborder, border, and postborder biosecurity measures collaboratively addressed by other federal, state, and county agencies, as well as the private industry and the public.
The goal of this HIBP is to ensure that existing and future biosecurity programs at multiple agencies are well supported, aligned to protect Hawaii from the impacts of invasive species, and effectively implemented by the respective organizations in a synergistic and coordinated manner.
2.2 HDOA Biosecurity Program
This section describes HDOA’s current biosecurity program. Act 236 of the Session Laws of Hawaii 2008, created a Biosecurity Program in the HDOA to support the department’s efforts in combating invasive species. The objectives of the Biosecurity Program are to (1) establish a multidimensional system to prevent the entry into the state and interisland movement of pests and prohibited or restricted organisms without a permit and (2) respond effectively to eradicate, control, reduce, and suppress incipient pest populations and established pests and seize and dispose of prohibited or restricted organisms without a permit. Actions identified in the statute include establishing preentry inspection programs, operating inspection facilities at ports of entry, controlling pests that have entered the state, providing greater collaboration regarding biosecurity among governmental agencies and industry, developing new tools to collect information on cargo being shipped, supporting local agricultural products to replace imports, and providing public outreach. The statute also established authority for HDOA to set and impose charges for inspection, quarantine, and eradication of pests, with the proceeds deposited into the pest inspection, quarantine, and eradication special fund.

Some of the challenges that HDOA faced in developing its Biosecurity Program were:
• more than 80% of all goods used in Hawaii are imported, and as long as people and cargo are imported, invasive species will be brought into the state through accidental transport;
• invasive species affect all aspects of society, including public health, agriculture, environment, and the economy;
• controlling and eradicating invasive species after establishment can be much more difficult and costly than prevention; and
• invasive species brought in on imported food products affects local agriculture and farmers.

High-volume on-time delivery of parcels and perishable goods coupled with the lack of adequate inspection areas makes inspection difficult at Hawaii’s ports and harbors. (Source: HDOA)
To meet these challenges, HDOA developed a broad strategy that included a focus on preventing the movement of pests into the state and between islands, the early detection and rapid control of invasive species if they are introduced, and the control and eradication of those pests causing the greatest harm to the state and its resources. An important initiative of the Biosecurity Program is to promote and encourage local agriculture so as to reduce dependency on imports, which have the potential to introduce new invasive species. HDOA has been working on developing the following capacities for its biosecurity program (HDOA 2007, 2015):
• Prevention—inspections at ports of entry and development of origin certification programs for highrisk commodities
• Diagnostics—identification of invasive insects, plant pathogens, and weeds
• Detection—surveillance for the existence and location of an invasive species that have invaded or been introduced
• Rapid response—quick control measures to eliminate individual pest incursions (e.g., snakes), as well as incipient population of an invasive species

Hawaii Interagency Biosecurity Plan 2017–2027

12

December 2016

• Monitoring—surveys to track the presence and status of introduced invasive species over time and also evaluate efficacy of control programs

• Biological sampling—surveys to track the presence and status of species over time

• Research and development—development of scientific knowledge, methods, and technologies to prevent, detect, control, and monitor invasive species and assist in implementing learned technologies to control invasive species effects on agricultural production and native ecosystems

• Education outreach—actions taken to support public education programs

• Partnerships and cooperative activities—with stakeholders (agricultural industries, conservation groups, the transportation industry) and federal, state, county, and private partners

• Information management—storing and sharing data and databases

• Quality control programs—activities to measure levels of effectiveness

• Quarantine treatment facilities—facilities to conduct disinfestation treatments

• Permitting—issuing permits based on statutes, regulations, and prior board (Board of Agriculture) decisions

• Compliance and enforcement—program to compel compliance with quarantine laws and regulations

• Import substitution and Hawaii export programs—substitution of risky imports with locally produced products and promoting export of Hawaii-grown agricultural goods

• Management of high-impact animal diseases—activities to detect and minimize the impact of animal diseases

• Pesticide regulation and use— Through its Biosecurity Program, HDOA collaborates with the

activities to regulate the manufacture,

reduces the number of pests reaching Hawaii and facilitates border inspections. (Source: HDOA)

Some of the projects that have been developed and implemented by HDOA and partners under HDOA’s biosecurity program include:

• Pilot transitional inspection facilities—a pilot program that demonstrated the usefulness and effectiveness of conducting inspections at an off-port site owned and operated by private produce distributors

Hawaii Interagency Biosecurity Plan 2017–2027

13

December 2016

• Emanifesting pilot project—to allow importers to send an electronic manifest (emanifest) of items being shipped to Hawaii in advance of arrival and enable HDOA to schedule inspections based on the commodity and the level of risk
• Christmas tree inspection project—increase in the duration of inspectors overseeing the project to establish best management practices and preshipment inspection protocols for Christmas trees shipped to Hawaii annually
• Nursery certification and compliance project—a pilot program for interisland shipments of commodities without inspection if the nursery follows best management practices to reduce risk or eliminate pest infestation
• Survey, early detection, and rapid response projects—survey, early detection, and rapid response for introduced pests and disease, including Rapid Ohia Death, little fire ant, coqui frog, and Africanized honey bee (Apis mellifera scutellata)
• Control projects—control via chemical, mechanical, or biological means of high-priority pests such as coqui frog, little fire ant, erythrina gall wasp (Quadrastichus erythrinae Kim), and fireweed (Senecio madagascariensis) to mitigate their impacts
In 2008, when the Biosecurity Program was implemented, HDOA had 147 positions and a budget of $10,019,000 for its PQ and PPC programs (SOH 2008). Over the past 8 years, the state has experienced the 2008 recession, a reduction in force, and elimination of vacant positions. The vital PQ and PPC programs were no exception and suffered a loss of 29 positions (26 permanent and three temporary positions): 13 in 2009 (SOH 2009) and another 16 in 2010 (SOH 2010). Since 2010, funding has increased with the establishment of inspection fees in the pest inspection, quarantine, and eradication special fund, and some positions have been restored. However, as of 2016, the PQ and PPC program budget has increased to $15,404,657, including $8,428,040 in special funds, but there are still only 121 permanent staff members—a net loss of 26 permanent staff positions from 2008. Over this same period, when HDOA’s biosecurity program staff has decreased by 18%, tonnage of incoming air cargo has increased by 34% (1989–2013), and tonnage of cargo moving through Honolulu Harbor has increased by 21% (1988–2014) (DBEDT 2014).
Staff shortages can hinder HDOA’s ability to provide systematic scrutiny of all high-risk pathways; spot-check of low-risk pathways; quarterly risk assessments; compliance agreements; rule changes; mitigation programs for the coqui frog, little fire ant, and nettle caterpillar; inspections of military and private jets and boats; interisland inspections; shared data management; nursery monitoring and assistance; monitoring ports for red imported fire ant (HDOA 2007); and additional needed actions, such as interdiction programs for the brown tree snake, canine detection programs, and investigation of violations of quarantine laws and regulations. Adding state staff capacity is essential if HDOA is expected to fully meet its obligations to protect Hawaii from invasive species. This HIBP identifies needed increases in staffing to accomplish these responsibilities, as well as additional implementation tasks identified in this plan. It also identifies the policy changes, resource increases, and

December 2016

implementation tasks that should be undertaken by other agencies to support and complement the work done for HDOA’s Biosecurity Program.
2.3 The Planning Process
As discussed above, components of biosecurity already exist in Hawaii. There is a great deal of literature related to pest risk assessments, invasion pathways, gap analysis and recommendations related to Hawaii’s biosecurity measures, and administrative rules and regulations related to biosecurity. Therefore, the first step in the planning process was to conduct a thorough review of the literature pertaining to Hawaii’s biosecurity. In addition, information on the well-known and well-established biosecurity systems of New Zealand and Australia, as well as those of other island jurisdictions, such as that for Galapagos Islands, was reviewed. A summary of the compiled literature on Hawaii’s biosecurity gaps and recommendations was developed to provide the foundation and framework for this HIBP.
Invasive species affect the entire community. Thus, one of HDOA’s most critical considerations during the development of this HIBP was to ensure that the community engagement process was extensive, inclusive, and comprehensive. This process included the following events:
• A public (government) sector workshop was organized to gather firsthand information about onthe-ground, procedural, regulatory, and funding challenges and opportunities from agencies such as HDOA, DLNR, APHIS, and HDOT that regulate or are deeply involved in biosecurity issues in Hawaii. The framework developed for this HIBP (and based on a summary of compiled literature on Hawaii biosecurity) was used to solicit input from the agency representatives during a 1-day-long professionally facilitated workshop.

During the planning process, a 1-day-long professionally facilitated workshop was held on April 14, 2016, to gather firsthand information from agencies and organizations involved in Hawaii’s biosecurity. (Source: H. T. Harvey & Associates)
• Private industry workshops and teleconferences were organized to gather input from the private industry stakeholders, such as the farmers, ranchers, nursery growers, and freight forwarders who are likely to be directly affected by invasive species and biosecurity measures. The input gathered from

Hawaii Interagency Biosecurity Plan 2017–2027

15

December 2016

the public sector workshop was incorporated into the framework of the developing plan before input from the private industry stakeholders was solicited through two 2-day-long workshops organized in Honolulu and Hilo.
The public review process was organized in September and October 2016. The draft HIBP, which incorporated input received from the public and private-sector stakeholders, was thoroughly reviewed by the lead agencies implementing this plan. Following their approval and a briefing with pertinent legislators and the governor’s office, the draft HIBP was released for public review on September 5, 2016. The draft HIBP was posted on HDOA’s website and was available to the general public to download. The public comment period, which ran from September 5 through October 19, 2016, was announced with a public notice in the local newspaper. Written comments were solicited from the public and received by email and mail during the public review period. In addition, a series of statewide public meetings were organized during the public review period to provide all stakeholders, including the general public, with an opportunity to provide both verbal and written testimonies. Public comments were incorporated into the draft HIBP wherever appropriate to produce this final HIBP.
2.4 Biosecurity Plan Structure, Organization, and Implementation
To meet the biosecurity challenges facing the state and effectively address this complex problem, this HIBP is designed to be comprehensive in scope (e.g., preborder, border, postborder) and interagency in nature. The objectives and implementation tasks identified in this HIBP are consistent with the existing government agencies’ and partner organizations’ strategic plans to address invasive species issues. This HIBP is also structured to be consistent with the programs of the various county, state, and federal agencies responsible for providing biosecurity protection in the state and nation. It is organized to implement HDOA’s and other state agencies’ programs that focus on one or more of the following four program areas:
• Preborder (Pre)
• Border (Bor)
• Postborder (Pos)
• Public Awareness and Support (Pws)
The goals for each of these program areas serve as guideposts to manage new and existing biosecurity risks. Each strategic goal is associated with long-term objectives and shorter-term implementation tasks. Within each program area, the objectives and implementation tasks are grouped according to the type of action they involve:
• Policy Action (Pol)
• Process or Program Action (Pro)
• Technology, Infrastructure, Funding, or Staffing (Tifs)

Hawaii Interagency Biosecurity Plan 2017–2027

16

December 2016

Accordingly, the implementation tasks related to one issue sometimes are discussed separately depending on whether it is about policy, process, or resource (technology, infrastructure, funding, or staffing). For instance, to implement a new emanifest system to collect information on incoming imports for screening and inspection purposes (process action), will require a change in statutes and rules (policy action) to authorize HDOA to identify commodities to inspect, prescreen, and release electronically. This action will also require HDOA to secure funds for equipment and increase staffing (technology, infrastructure, funding and staffing action) to implement the emanifest system. Therefore, there are three implementation tasks regarding emanifest system: one policy related; one process related; and one related to technology, infrastructure, funding, and staffing. This HIBP identifies these separate types of actions needed under each program area (preborder, border, and postborder).
Objectives outline general ideas that contribute to achieving the goal over the medium and long term. Implementation tasks are specific actions that will need to be taken to achieve each objective. Each implementation task is associated with a timeline, funds needed, lead agency, partners, and a priority ranking. This HIBP addresses both terrestrial and aquatic biosecurity issues, which are often addressed together under an overarching objective. Sometimes, they are addressed under a specific terrestrial or aquatic objective.
The goals, objectives, and implementation tasks discussed in this HIBP are presented as follows:

Goal (Preborder, Border, or Postborder)

This section is not meant to provide general information on preborder, border, postborder, or public awareness and support efforts in Hawaii. Rather, it provides specific background information, mostly from the state’s perspective, that is necessary to put the HIBP objectives in each program area in context with the need or gaps identified during the planning process.

2.4.1 Plan Implementation
The HIBP is an interagency plan; however, the responsibility of executing the plan lies with the lead agencies (see Section 2.4.4) listed in the plan—largely, HDOA and DLNR and, to a lesser degree, DOH, UH, and the counties. Implementation of tasks is expected to depend on the availability of time and funds, regulatory mandates, and the institutional support and commitment of the agencies involved. As the HIBP is implemented over the next 10 years, it will be incumbent on these individual lead agencies to include biosecurity implementation tasks in their annual budgets submitted to the legislature for each upcoming fiscal year. The specific amount requested may differ from those presented in the plan because information or requirements may have changed over time. In this scenario, in the absence of one coordinating body, each lead agency is responsible for overseeing the execution of tasks on which they are the lead, successfully completing their tasks, and reporting annually on the implementation progress.
An alternate scenario, where one coordinating body would be responsible for HIBP oversight and reporting is the potential Hawaii Invasive Species Authority (HISA). One of the tasks in the HIBP, scheduled for 20172019, is to restructure the existing HISC as the Hawaii Invasive Species Authority (HISA), an autonomous interagency body to coordinate interagency biosecurity programs and policy initiatives, provide oversight and reporting on biosecurity program implementation, and administer a grant program to fill gaps in agencies and partners programs (also see Section 3.3, “Postborder”). If formation of HISA is successful, then it will provide interagency oversight for implementation of the HIBP. Individual agencies would still be responsible for implementing their action items, but HISA would assist where necessary and would track and report progress on the HIBP to the legislature and public annually. Rather than administratively being hosted by an agency (e.g., HISC being hosted by DLNR), HISA would function as an autonomous interagency body administratively attached to HDOA. Because HDOA has broad mandates regarding biosecurity, it would be the most appropriate agency to which HISA could be attached. However, it should be noted that all HDOA regulatory authorities and all HDOA special funds would remain under the control of HDOA. HISA’s role would be that of a coordinating body similar to the existing HISC but, with ability to hire staff and additional board seats (voting members) representing agriculture, industry, conservation, and cultural perspectives.
2.4.2 Timeline
This HIBP is designed to be implemented over a period of 10 fiscal years, from July 2017 through June 2027 (Fiscal Year 2018 [FY2018] through FY2027). Work on implementation tasks may start as soon as January 2017, as staff and resources are available. The timeline includes the proposed start and completion dates for each implementation task in calendar years, beginning with 2017 for tasks that can be started immediately. Many tasks are envisioned to require new staffing or funding and are scheduled to be started at the beginning of a given fiscal year. The first fiscal year identified in the plan is FY2018 and is denoted as 2018 in the timeline.
2.4.3 Funding
This HIBP identifies the estimated amounts of funds needed to implement given tasks. The “Funds Needed” column identifies the total amount needed to implement a task over the duration identified in the “Timeline”

Hawaii Interagency Biosecurity Plan 2017–2027

18

December 2016

column. These estimates are based on the best information available when this HIBP was drafted. As mentioned above, over the next 10 years, it will be incumbent on the individual lead agencies to prepare specific funding requests for each upcoming fiscal year, and these amounts may differ from those presented here because information or requirements may change over time. The designation “ES/EF” (Existing Staff or Existing Funds) is used in this column when the task is intended to be performed by the lead agency or partnering organization staff members using existing staff and resources.
Appendix A presents additional details on the HIBP budget that, for purposes of brevity, are not included in the plan implementation task tables. These details include an explanation of how the funding was estimated, the type of funds (Capital Improvement Project [CIP] budget versus operating cost budget), subtotals for each implementation task for each fiscal biennium, total HIBP implementation cost, and the average annual costs. The HIBP does not identify the sources of funding, such as general funds, special funds, or federal funds but rather the general type of funds that could be used (i.e., funds from the CIP budget or operating cost budget).
2.4.4 Lead Agency
The “Lead Agency” column identifies which agency or organization is responsible for implementing, coordinating, and completing the task. Typically, a single entity is identified in this column. If two or more lead agencies are identified, these agencies will implement the same task simultaneously. Existing and/or new staff members budgeted for the lead agency are expected to implement that task. The lead agency is responsible for requesting the allocated funds for implementing a task from the legislature in its biennium budget.
2.4.5 Partnering Organization
The partnering organization identified in the “Partners” column can be another state or federal agency; UH; the county government; a private industry or landowner; or a quasi-government organization, such as CGAPS. Partnering organizations are expected to contribute to implementing that task with their existing staff and resources. Their contributions could include providing information, review of task products, approval of permits, access or use of their land, or support and advocacy during the legislative process.
2.4.6 Priority Ranking
Each lead agency prioritized the implementation tasks for which it is designated as the lead. In DLNR, DAR prioritized tasks pertaining to aquatic issues, and DOFAW prioritized tasks pertaining to terrestrial issues for which DLNR is the lead. The focus during prioritization was on the importance of the implementation task rather than the timeline and funding. Priority rankings are presented in the last column. The process of prioritization was subjective, based on the following criteria:
1 = critical for effective biosecurity 2 = strongly beneficial for effective biosecurity 3 = generally beneficial for effective biosecurity

In general, tasks that involve prevention activities, such as risk assessments, emergency response, and early detection and response, and those that involve increasing staff size to support core biosecurity functions are given a priority ranking of 1. When specific funding requests are prepared for each upcoming fiscal year, it is expected that agencies will select biosecurity tasks for inclusion in their budgets based on the HIBP timeline and the priority ranking allocated to the tasks.

Section 3.0 Goals, Objectives, and Implementation Tasks

3.1 Preborder

Goal: Prevent the Transport of Invasive Species to Hawaii

3.1.1 Background
Preventing invasive alien species from reaching Hawaii’s borders is the most cost-effective strategy to manage threats from invasive species. The implementation tasks and objectives presented in this section are aligned to address the goal of preventing the entry of an invasive species into Hawaii.

Federal agencies like APHIS, CBP, USFWS, the U.S. Coast Guard

(USCG), and CDC and the two state biosecurity agencies of HDOA

and DLNR primarily regulate or enforce regulation relative to the

entry of organisms into Hawaii. From a regulatory viewpoint, the

federal government is responsible for preventing foreign plant and

animal diseases and pests from entering the United States. In

general, state agencies are responsible for regulating domestic

commodities originating elsewhere in the United States. In Hawaii,

HDOA’s inspection authority, with a few exceptions (quarantine

periods, permits, and/or treatment for coffee, bromeliads, banana,

grasses etc.), extends mostly to agricultural and high-risk materials

coming from the continental United States. HDOA inspects for a

range of organisms and can take action on those that are prohibited,

those that are restricted, and also those not known to occur in

Pests like red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) can easily arrive in Hawaii via nonagricultural commodities, including packaging materials. However, HDOA does not have the authority to inspect nonagricultural commodities and will need to pursue legislative amendment to do so. (Source: HISC)

Hawaii. Under the Plant Protection Act (7 United States Code [USC] Section 7701 et seq.), states are expressly prevented from regulating foreign commerce to control, eradicate, or prevent the introduction or dissemination of plant pests or noxious weeds (7 USC Section 7756[a]). The Plant Protection Act also preempts states from regulating domestic commerce if the federal government has already

issued such a regulation for those purposes, unless the regulation is consistent with but does not exceed the

federal regulation (7 USC Section 7756[b]). With a few exceptions, HDOA is prevented from inspecting foreign

commerce or taking any quarantine action on foreign commerce at ports of entry. In certain instances, federal

law also bans HDOA inspection of some domestic cargo (e.g., first-class mail). Therefore, federal inspectors in

Hawaii have a critical role to prevent pests of foreign origin from entering the state (HDOA 2007, Loope and

Kraus 2009, Rago and Sugano 2015). The state also can play a critical role by working with federal agencies on

solutions to federal preemption of state quarantine needs relative to the Plant Protection Act, determining whether insular areas such as Hawaii can obtain special recognition in the United States from a biosecurity perspective, and strengthening federal quarantine laws dealing with nonagricultural products.
USDA can take action on organisms that pose a documented threat to U.S. agriculture, forestry, or environment and those that are on lists of federally regulated organisms, such as the Federal Noxious Weed List. However, species that may not pose a risk to the temperate crops and forests of the continental United States could pose a risk in Hawaii’s year-round optimal climate. In fact, many organisms that are of greatest risk to Hawaii, such as little fire ant, myoporum (naio) thrips (Klambothrips myopori), and nettle caterpillar, are not among the federally regulated organisms. Hawaii has unique biosecurity needs (see Section 2.0, “Introduction”):
• Hawaii is extremely vulnerable to biological invasions (McGregor 1973, HDOA 2002).
• The spectrum of dominant endemic/native plant species in Hawaii differs from that found in the rest of the United States and provides habitat for the rest of Hawaii’s biota, including many endangered species and a largely endemic (found nowhere else in the world) biota (DeNitto et al. 2015).
• Hawaii imports more than 80% of all its goods and approximately 90% of its food (HDOT 1997, Lueng and Loke 2008).
To prevent the entry of invasive species via foreign pathways, Hawaii needs to continue to emphasize its unique biosecurity needs and receive better federal protection. A thorough analysis of international, federal, and state policy gaps with recommendations to close such loopholes is warranted (PrePol3). There are relatively new programs that allow states to petition for federal action on a state concern. HDOA should leverage such programs and work with APHIS to develop quarantine regulations specific to Hawaii. Whenever APHIS announces draft regulations on potential quarantines for proposed imports to the United States, HDOA should provide a response with information that supports the need for specific restrictions on such importation to Hawaii. However, HDOA has few resources to put together and track petition packages, and the scope of the state Attorney General (AG) office’s role is so broad that focused response and active involvement with APHIS’s commenting processes can be a challenge. A policy analyst housed in HDOA could help fill this gap (PreTifs2).
As mentioned above, HDOA’s inspection authority extends largely to agricultural or high-risk materials (e.g. coffee, banana, grasses, bromeliads) coming from the continental United States. However, nonagricultural commodities and packaging material have been identified as important pathways for the entry of invasive species into Hawaii (DeNitto et al. 2015, USN 2015). Intercepting pests entering the state via these pathways would require legislative amendments that give HDOA the authority to inspect and quarantine high-risk nonagricultural commodities (PrePol2).
Preventing pests from entering Hawaii will require not only more comprehensive and cohesive authorities but also available technology and processes to improve efficiency. More than 80% of all goods used in Hawaii are

December 2016

imported (HDOA 2007). Inspecting all imports is impossible, but risk assessment would allow HDOA to determine which commodities and pathways pose a higher risk for the entry of pests (PreProl, PreTifs2). The HDOA PQ Branch maintains a database called INVICTA to record inspection, permitting, and pest reporting activities. This type of database is an essential tool for storing information and is used extensively to determine the effectiveness of operations and analyze the risks associated with pathways and commodities (HDOA 2015). However, this database lacks the ability to perform other important HDOA functions, such as house important taxonomic data and communicate with other databases. An important feature of emanifest was integrated into this database system but was not fully implemented because of the associated costs.

Implementing an emanifest system would allow importers to send relevant information about the shipment (e.g., what is being shipped, where the shipment originated) to HDOA before the commodities arrive. This system will allow HDOA to schedule inspections based on the risk of the arriving commodities; release lowrisk commodities electronically, thereby allowing for more efficient use of the limited workforce; and in general help prevent the arrival of unwanted organisms in Hawaii. HDOA is in critical need of a regulatory framework, processes, and technology to launch a sophisticated biosecurity database that can support an emanifest system, allow for efficient data gathering and sharing, and facilitate risk assessments and a full-time staff member to support this key component for biosecurity (PrePol2, PrePro1, PreTifs1, PreTifs2).

Invasive species that are affecting Hawaii forestry and agriculture, such as little fire ant, nettle caterpillar, ohia rust, and the fungus strain causing Rapid Ohia Death, likely arrived via plants. The import of plants for landscaping, sale or propagation, cut flowers, and foliage is considered a high-risk pathway for pests (Loope and Uchida 2012, DeNitto et al. 2015). HDOA is dedicated to enhance Hawaii’s economy by promoting local agriculture, aquaculture, and landscape industries and by minimizing the impacts of invasive species. Key strategies identified during the planning process to protect these industries include requiring agreements for imported high-risk plant products to have phytosanitary certificates (PrePol2), reducing the importation of plant and animal species that are already available in Hawaii and boosting their local propagation or production, and substituting the importation of invasive plant and animal species with local production of noninvasive alternatives (PrePro2, PreTifs2).

Boosting the production of locally grown food is a key biosecurity strategy to reduce dependence on imported produce and therefore minimize the risk of pests entering Hawaii via this pathway. (Source: HDOA)

Another important strategy to prevent pests from entering Hawaii is to move the greatest incursion risks as far offshore as possible and require, where possible, offshore inspection, treatment (with certification), or other actions. APHIS does this by collaborating with foreign partners to control pests and diseases before they can

enter the transport system. For example, APHIS Wildlife Services in Guam takes numerous measures, such trapping and using trained snake-detector dogs in cargo, to keep brown tree snakes from reaching Hawaii and other destinations. Hawaii has also taken this approach when screening Christmas trees. Before they are shipped to Hawaii, Christmas trees and wreaths are inspected and reconditioned (mostly through mechanical shaking) in Oregon by the Oregon Department of Agriculture (HDOA 2015). This approach has significantly reduced the number of pests that arrive through this pathway. More goods being exported to Hawaii can be inspected offshore at transitional facilities owned and operated by private industries that meet Hawaii-specific standards for the building structure, as well as for screening protocols (PrePol2, PrePro1, PrePro4).

The illegal importation of regulated plants and animals remains an important pathway for pests entering Hawaii (HISC 2014, Rago and Sugano 2015, USN 2015). For example, seeds of plants that are restricted or prohibited in Hawaii can be purchased online and shipped here, without properly labeling the parcel or presenting the material to HDOA for inspection. Gathering information and working with online plant nurseries and pet stores so they understand Hawaii’s biosecurity needs would reduce the illegal importation of plants and animals and their associated pests into Hawaii (PrePro3).

In general, Hawaii does not have the authority to

inspect or quarantine commodities transported by

the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) from

foreign ports to the islands. DOD is also exempt

from the state’s ballast water rules. However, DOD

is a large stakeholder in Hawaii’s biosecurity. The

five armed forces of DOD are represented in a total

of 19 military bases and compounds in Hawaii.

Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA)

Ballast water is a high-risk pathway for the entry of Aquatic Invasive Species into Hawaii. Current regulations regarding exchange of ballast water and processes to report and document it do not provide adequate biosecurity protection for Hawaii. (Source: CGAPS)

requires that DOD (along with all other federal agencies) consult with USFWS on any actions that may affect species listed under the ESA. Section 7 consultation includes an analysis of the effects of the

introduction or spread of invasive species by the federal action on listed species. These consultations often

focus on the transport of supplies or equipment (e.g., from Guam to Hawaii or within Hawaii). If the

consultation determines that the spread of invasive species is likely, USFWS works with DOD (or other federal

action agencies) to develop avoidance and minimization measures to reduce the likelihood that the invasive

species will spread. Therefore, provisions in completed Section 7 consultations are one type of federal

regulatory driver supporting DOD biosecurity protocols regarding transport of equipment from Guam to

Hawaii. The state needs to enhance its partnership with DOD and federal quarantine and regulatory agencies

through formal mechanisms, such as the ESA and Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs), to adopt stricter

biosecurity measures that would provide increased protection to Hawaii (PrePol1, PrePro3).

Hawaii’s role in safeguarding livestock and poultry industries against animal diseases of high concern is important because it affects the ability of the United States to trade agriculture products on the global market. HDOA’s AI Division issues import permits and enforces prearrival requirements to ensure that newly imported animals have been properly identified, examined, and tested for disease before transport. The AI Division identified a need for more efficient use of technology and better coordination with federal and international partners to identify and screen for high-impact animal diseases. In particular, there is the need to align the list of notifiable diseases with internationally and nationally recognized lists of existing threats to domestic livestock, identify new threats and ensure that adequate biosecurity measures are taken, and fund equipment and licensing that will better record the movement of livestock animals to maintain database on arriving animals and align with federal data (PrePol3, PrePro1, PreTifs1).

With regard to aquatic organisms, USCG, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), DAR, and DOH share regulatory authority to prevent the entry of AIS via ballast water. In this case, unlike under the Plant Protection Act, the state has greater freedom to regulate. It can regulate ballast water discharged in state waters irrespective of whether the vessel originates from a foreign or domestic (U.S. mainland) port, with some exceptions, such as DOD vessels. However, there is insufficient coordination with national and international port authorities, the DOD, and shipping companies to ensure that ballast water procedures are being implemented consistently (DLNR 2003, Davidson et al. 2014, USN 2015) (PrePol1). Furthermore, current regulation regarding the exchange of ballast water and reporting/documenting systems does not provide adequate protection and needs to be updated to, at a minimum, meet more protective USCG national standards (PrePol1). Unlike ballast water, the USCG does not regulate and the state does not have the authority to regulate hull biofouling as an invasive species risk; this issue is addressed in Section 3.2, “Border.”

Specific objectives and implementation tasks related to policy, process, and infrastructure and funding resources needed to enhance preborder security in Hawaii are listed below.

Priority Ranking 1 2

Goal: Enhance the Detection and Control of Pests and Diseases at Ports of Entry
3.2.1 Background
Effective surveillance, detection, and treatment of pests at the border depend on a robust regulatory framework that authorizes state and federal agricultural inspectors to take action on species that reach our borders, processes that allow for efficient execution of biosecurity measures, and infrastructure and technology to support implementation of border security processes.
The same agencies engaged in preborder security also have a mandate to ensure the inspection for pests and treatment of invasive species that reach Hawaii’s borders. HDOA, APHIS, CBP, and USFWS are among the key regulatory agencies that screen incoming people and products at our borders. Hawaii has 16 ports and harbors, and Honolulu Harbor and Honolulu International Airport receive the vast majority (more than 90%) of passengers, cargo, and conveyances arriving from both domestic and foreign sources. Hawaii also receives goods through local, national, and international mail at its various statewide post offices and Honolulu is one of only a handful of cities in the nation with an international mail facility. HDOA and USDA agricultural inspectors prevent the introduction of harmful pests and diseases from domestic (other U.S. states) and foreign sources, respectively. This work is conducted primarily through various programs, including permit reviews, air and sea ports-of-entry inspections and quarantine, interisland inspections (covered in Section 3.3, “Postborder”), and investigation and enforcement of state and federal quarantine laws and regulations.

Hawaii Interagency Biosecurity Plan 2017–2027

December 2016

Screening for pests at the border primarily involves visual inspection of agricultural items (including plants, plant parts, nondomestic animals, microorganism cultures, microbial products, arthropods, and soil). HDOA maintains lists of taxa that are conditionally approved for importation, restricted, or prohibited from importation. For example, all unlisted nondomestic animals are considered prohibited from entry, but there is no list of prohibited microorganisms, so they can only be imported after review and approval by the agriculture board. However, these lists do not include important plants, animals, and microorganisms recognized to be harmful to Hawaii. For example, the state’s noxious weed list primarily includes weeds of agriculture and temperate climates, many of which are already widespread in Hawaii. Therefore, to enhance biosecurity, lists of state-regulated organisms must be updated periodically to include organisms (based on the results of plant or pest risk assessments, see Section 3.1, “Preborder”) that are harmful to Hawaii’s agriculture, its natural environment, and the health and lifestyle of its people (BorPol2).

Honolulu International Airport and Honolulu Harbor receive the vast majority of commodities shipped to Hawaii. At these border ports, HDOA is our first line of defense against invasive species entering Hawaii. (Source: HDOA)
At the federal level, the mandate of the agencies is to protect the United States from the impacts of harmful species. However, as discussed above, Hawaii has unique biosecurity needs compared to the other 49 states (see Section 2.0, “Introduction,” and Section 3.1, “Preborder”). Therefore, the federal lists of pests to report and take action on do not always include pests that are specifically harmful to Hawaii, and the related regulations also do not always address these harmful pests. State and federal inspectors in Hawaii coordinate to detect invasive species of state importance entering via foreign pathways. However, it is in the state’s best interest to coordinate and harmonize pest lists and actions whenever possible and to share information on interceptions and species of concern through formal (e.g., policy change, see Section 3.1, “Preborder”) and informal (e.g., meetings, workshops, see BorPol1, BorPro1) mechanisms to ensure that Hawaii is protected from harmful pests entering from foreign sources.
In general, imported agricultural commodities are inspected where they first arrive: in cargo areas of importers, in temporary spaces, or even on the dock piers or airport tarmacs. Given this current situation, combined with the increasingly high volume of cargo shipped to Hawaii and concern for food safety, there is an urgent need to plan and secure additional and appropriate inspection facilities. This need is likely to be magnified further if HDOA is authorized to also inspect high-risk nonagricultural commodities.

Imported produce often awaits inspection outdoors at the ports (left). To meet the growing volume of imported goods, HDOA urgently needs enclosed, well-lit, and temperature-controlled facilities (right) to conduct inspections efficiently and enhance border protection. (Source: HDOA)
In 2009, HDOA implemented a pilot program whereby inspections for some agricultural commodities are conducted at a transitional facility transitional facilities owned and operated by private industry (e.g., produce distributor) in Honolulu. Because the unloading and inspections are performed in an air-conditioned area and the facility is secured, this approach reduces the chance for pests to escape and maintains food quality during the inspection process. The importers also benefit because perishable goods are transported immediately to these secure and temperature-controlled facilities for inspection. Having additional transitional inspection facilities, especially near major ports and harbors statewide, would greatly facilitate increased inspections and enhance border security for Hawaii (BorTifs2). However, a change in statute is needed to require importers to transport commodities that are high risk to such off-port state-designated transitional facilities. Current HDOA regulations allow for inspection at such transitional inspection facilities; however, formulating well-defined regulations and developing building and operating standards so that these facilities meet HDOA’s biosecurity standards would better meet the industry demand for such facilities and would strengthen border security (BorPol1, BorProl1).
Although based on the results of the pilot program, transitional facilities have proved to work well for agricultural items, HDOA anticipates needing more space for screening high-risk nonagricultural commodities. Furthermore, HDOA does not have the authority to require shippers or importers to transport nonagricultural goods for inspection to a facility located outside of a port or harbor. HDOA therefore needs to pursue an amendment to existing regulation that will authorize it to require the transport of high-risk commodities to offsite transitional facilities (BorPol1). However, in the interim, HDOA needs to work with HDOT and the private sector to use available space at the ports and harbors to meet the growing needs for inspection.
Pest interception reports indicate that cargo inspections yield more interceptions when additional staff members participate (BorTifs1). This participation includes the use of dogs (with handlers) trained to detect agricultural materials in places not otherwise visible to the inspectors (e.g., passenger bags) (BorTifs2). With adequate staffing, cargo inspection plays a major role in mitigating pest introduction and therefore is a high priority when

resources are allocated. Additional resources, such as Xray machines for surveillance and autoclaves and freezers for destroying harmful pests, contribute to make border security processes more efficient (BorTifs2).

A risk assessment study at the Kahului airport reported to have

detected on average, one organism per day that was not known

to occur in Hawaii and could potentially be a pest (HDOA 2002).

Invasive species not known to occur in Hawaii, such as the

brown tree snake, and predicted to cause huge economic and

ecological damage, have been intercepted multiple times at the

borders. These interceptions highlight the need for continuous

monitoring in and around ports of entry to capture pests that

infiltrated the borders (BorPro1). In addition, there are numerous examples where a lack of dedicated funding or immediate, coordinated efforts for detection and eradication allowed newly

detected pests (in the vicinity of borders or beyond) (e.g., banana bunchy top virus, coffee berry borer

[Hypothenemus hampei], little fire ant) to become established, leaving no other option than expensive and perpetual

containment or control. Hawaii needs to establish an interagency biosecurity emergency task force with

dedicated funding to enhance its capacity to take timely action to eradicate new pest incursions (BorPol1,

BorPro3).

Movement of domestic animal species is a recognized pathway whereby diseases and exotic parasites of high concern may enter the state. Current border activities that guard against entry of animal disease include inspection by AI staff to examine animals for clinical signs of illness and presence of foreign parasites; verify permits, shipping documents, and tracking devices; and enforce import and handling requirements. However, livestock disease monitoring services (staff and infrastructure) are limited to only some ports and need to be expanded (BorPro1, BorTifs1, BorTifs2). Policy changes to effectively enforce penalties for violating animal import requirements also would facilitate better border protection (BorPol1).

Vessel biofouling has contributed between 35% and 78% of Hawaii’s introduced and cryptogenic species (n=346). It is ranked highest among all vectors of initial introduction to Hawaii, but there are no regulations that authorize the state to inspect vessels. (Source: Davidson et al. 2014)

Ballast water (addressed in Section 3.1) and hull biofouling are two important pathways for the entry of AIS into the state. There currently are no state rules in place for DAR to regulate inspection of vessels (for invasive species that may be attached to the hull) that enter state waters (PrePol1). USCG does not regulate biofouling; therefore, DAR’s authority to manage this risk is very important. Developing standard operating procedures for collecting and reporting data, implementing best management practices for hull cleaning, testing and applying new techniques for treating ballast water and hull biofouling are just a few strategies identified in this HIBP to minimize the spread of AIS that

cross our border (BorPro2). Staffing must be increased, and a data management system must be implemented (BorTifs3) to support a comprehensive program to manage biosecurity threats related to ballast water and hull biofouling.

3.3 Postborder

Goal: Protect Hawaii from Invasive Species Already Present within the State
3.3.1 Background
In this HIBP, the term postborder refers to the area in which a pest is found after it has passed the point or opportunity of border inspection, whether or not it was detected. Postborder encompasses the policies, processes, and programs aimed at detecting, eradicating, or controlling the spread or impacts of pest plants, animals, and diseases after they are beyond the ports of entry and inspection process. Measures to address the interisland movement of pests are identified in this section.
Even the best efforts at preborder and border prevention, detection, and interception cannot intercept 100% of the species that will become invasive in Hawaii. Similarly, investing solely in preborder or prevention activities ignores the costs and impacts of pests that are already present in Hawaii and species that need active management to keep from incurring even higher costs (and possibly causing irreversible harm). Hawaii needs to continue to build and support early detection and rapid response capacities, policies, and processes that can reduce interisland movement of pests, as well as programs that control widespread pests or their impacts on the environment, public health, and the economy.
It is estimated that an organism not known to occur in Hawaii, and potentially a new pest, is detected at Hawaii’s ports every day and that more than 20 insect species are introduced annually (HISC 2015, Rago and Sugano 2015). Newly arrived, incipient species may be eradicated if they are detected early enough. Established species that may have been introduced many years ago, such as strawberry guava, may require biocontrol to slow its spread. What is established on one island may be incipient on another. Between 1995 and 2003, an average of 89 additional alien species became established in Hawaii each year, and it is estimated that 300–500 of the more than 5,000 established alien species in the islands are invasive and damaging (Eldredge and Evenhuis 2003, Loope and Kraus 2009). These pests have major impacts on farmland, ranchland, native habitats, rare and endangered species, watersheds, marine and freshwater ecosystems, and they threaten or

affect human and animal health and safety, aquaculture, agriculture, quality of life, tourism, and other cultural and economic resources important to the state.

A sampling of the harmful species that are the target of current

control programs or that require expanded control include the

mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, which spread

dengue fever and the Zika virus; the mosquito Culex

quinquefasciatus, which carries the parasite that causes avian

malaria; the new strain of Ceratocystis fimbriata, a fungus that

causes Rapid Ohia Death, which kills ohia (Metrosideros

polymorpha) and damages watersheds on Hawaii Island; feral

ungulates, including feral pigs (Sus scrofa), goats (Capra hircus),

and axis deer (Axis axis), which damage watersheds and

agricultural crops; small predators, such as rodents and

mongoose (Herpestes javanicus), which prey on native animals

and plants; coffee berry borer, which reduces the quality and

value of coffee beans; marine algae and snowflake coral (Carijoa riisei), which invade, overgrow, smother, and kill coral reefs statewide; little fire ant, which threatens agriculture,

quality of life, and tourism; albizia (Falcataria moluccana), which threatens public health and safety and native

forests; and other invasive plants like miconia, and strawberry guava, which outcompete and replace native

forests and reduce the capture and recharge of fresh, clean water. The lost agricultural production, lost

ecosystem services, and the cost of control, as well as the impacts on our lifestyle and culture associated with

invasive species such as these, have a large impact on our economy and well-being.

Postborder biosecurity in agricultural and natural systems primarily falls under the invasive species or disease control programs of HDOA, DLNR, and DOH and the research, agricultural extension, conservation, and enforcement programs at UH. Federal agencies, such as USFWS, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), USFS, USGS, NPS, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, and DOD, control invasive species on their lands and/or provide direct and technical assistance, research, and funding to state and private partners for their efforts. USFWS also conducts Section 7 consultations under the ESA for all actions that may affect listed endangered species. For example, the Federal Highway Administration consults with USFWS on road construction projects. These consultations include identification of best management practices that the Federal Highway Administration and HDOT implement to prevent further spread of invasive species. In addition, nonfederal agencies or private landowners may develop habitat conservation plans under Section 10 of the ESA to mitigate for actions that “take” listed species. Habitat conservation plans are another tool that can be used to incorporate measures to avoid the spread of invasive species. These front-line agencies spend millions of dollars annually to control established pests in agricultural lands, watersheds, and native habitats and to protect other important cultural and economic resources (Rago and Sugano 2015). Other state agencies, county governments, conservation groups, and many private landowners also have programs to

Hawaii Interagency Biosecurity Plan 2017–2027

42

December 2016

manage invasive species on their lands. Many of the county, state, and federal agencies provide grants to help public and private landowners control and manage invasive species on their lands. The state grant programs consistently receive far more requests for funding than they have funds to award (DLNR 2015).

The UH’s island-based Invasive Species Committees (ISCs) also play an important role in the control of invasive species. They function as informal multipartner committees that can work with a variety of funding sources and across landownership boundaries and agency jurisdiction to provide rapid response and control services for incipient pests (Kraus and Duffy 2010). Similarly, the Watershed Partnerships field crews that control ungulates, weeds, and invasive species on private and public forestlands on all islands. HAL provides technical expertise, direction, and field support for the detection and control of invasive ants. All these agencies and partners are engaged in some aspect of invasive species control and demonstrate the multiagency scope and collaborative approach described in this plan.

An additional line of defense in the efforts to control invasive species is the private pest control industry. Private industry often takes over after government programs end and responsibility for control passes to the private landowner. These operations often require specialized licensing for use of toxicants for pests such as termites or little fire ants or toxicants used in conservation areas. Finding ways to support industry and safely streamline regulations so that private industry can operate more efficiently will assist all our efforts to control invasive species in urban areas, on crop and noncrop rural lands, and on conservation lands.

This HIBP identifies policies, processes, and resources to support three strategies for limiting and controlling the impacts of invasive species. These strategies are (1) early detection, rapid response, and eradication of

Hawaii Interagency Biosecurity Plan 2017–2027

43

December 2016

incipient populations; (2) containment in localized area or on a single island; and (3) long-term pest management of islandwide or statewide pests. Early detection, rapid response, and eradication involve authorities, programs, and response capabilities of HDOA, DLNR, DOH, UH, ISCs, HAL, UH’s CTAHR, as well as federal partners, including APHIS, USFWS, and NPS, to detect and attempt to eradicate pests and diseases before they become established. This HIBP identifies the resources that state agencies need to support staff and rapid response capacity statewide.
Containment, which includes interisland control, involves HDOA, DLNR, DOH, UH, Watershed Partnerships, ISCs, HAL, and industry using their authority, programs, and response capabilities to attempt to prevent the spread of invasive species. Containment involves working with producers and industries that ship high-risk commodities interisland and inspecting their cargo. It also involves containing newly found incipientpests within an island and preventing the spread of noxious established pests into high-value natural communities. Long-term pest management and resource protection requires the participation of HDOA, DLNR, UH, and Watershed Partnerships; federal partners, including USFWS, NOAA, USFS, and NPS; and private industry and landowners. Long-term pest management falls mostly on land managers, both public and private, and this HIBP identifies tasks to support and develop tools for private and public land managers and landowners. Tasks include HDOA biocontrol projects, control of pests in the habitat of threatened and endangered species and protected areas, removal of invasive algae from coral reefs, and control of predators. Challenges related to implementing these strategies and the HIBP objectives and implementation tasks identified to meet these challenges are discussed further below.
The large number of invasive species and their distribution across many different habitats and landowners presents difficult challenges for public and private landowners to control pests and protect important lands and resources. Many public landowners manage protected areas that are open to commercial and recreational uses and are at risk from the introduction of invasive species through commercial and recreational activities. Changes in rules to prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species into protected areas is needed. Similarly, protected aquatic habitats are at risk from the spread of AIS, and stricter regulation of the importation, sale, husbandry, and distribution of high-risk AIS is needed (PosPol2). The ability to enforce biosecurity laws and rules on private and public lands is also a critical issue. An analysis and report of the effectiveness of current enforcement and prosecution of biosecurity laws, and which administrative and criminal penalties should be revised, is needed to provide more effective deterrence and increased compliance (PosPro1).
Detecting and controlling invasive species across a large landscape present difficult challenges. There is often limited technology, infrastructure, funding, and staffing to control wide-spread established pests. Agencies and landowners need to work together to be effective. Cooperative approaches that are needed include statewide surveillance and monitoring programs to enable early detection of and rapid response to new infestations (PosPro1); working with partners to write species-specific and generic emergency response plans (PosPro3); supporting the statewide Watershed Partnerships to assist private and public landowners to control invasive species on their lands; and supporting ISCs and HAL to fill gaps in response capacity at the county level to control high-risk and incipient populations of invasive species on private and public lands (PosPro1). To

Hawaii Interagency Biosecurity Plan 2017–2027

44

December 2016

provide a more established presence for the ISCs and HAL in the biosecurity program, their funding and organizational structure should be institutionalized in the UH system. Currently, ISCs and HAL exist as research and management programs under PCSU at UH, and this HIBP includes a task to institutionalize funding and organizational structure in UH.

Greater coordination amongst agencies in administrative measures can also help to control the spread of established pests and prevent damage to important areas. Writing best management practices for control of invasive species that agencies, industry, and private individuals can readily access and follow (PosPro1) will give individuals and agencies useful tools they may implement. Additionally, incorporating those standards into Hawaii Environmental Policy Act/National Environmental Policy Act (HEPA/NEPA) reviews, permit and project reviews, and state contracts (PosPro3) will set requirements that would be enforceable.

Management of AIS presents similar difficulties as

with terrestrial systems. New species are continually

arriving, and there is often limited technology,

infrastructure, funding, and staffing to control

widespread established pests, and the logistical

challenges of working in marine environments add

complexities. Agencies and community partners

need to work together to be effective. Cooperative

approaches that are needed include coordinating

survey and monitoring efforts among the various

public and private agencies and organizations

conducting early monitoring for AIS; writing

debris after it reaches Hawaii shores; increasing

state agency efforts and supporting local community efforts to control and eradicate AIS. Using mechanical

removal and native grazers to control invasive algae on at-risk reefs statewide; investigating successful AIS

vector control programs in other states and countries; and raising standards for aquaculture and point-of-sale

facilities that keep, propagate, and sell imported aquatic species, to minimize chances of release into the wild

(PosPro4) are a few strategies identified to control AIS. These programs will require additional funding to

implement (PosTifs1).

These expanded efforts to control established terrestrial species and AIS require more resources than is currently being provided. Additional resources for ongoing mechanical and chemical control of invasive species in watersheds, on state lands, on farms and ranches, and in neighborhoods and communities was identified as a major need in meetings with agencies, during stakeholder workshops, and in recent reports (Loope and Kraus 2009, DLNR 2015, HDOA 2015, Rago and Sugano 2015). There is also a need to continually refine and develop control techniques that are more efficient, effective, safe, and/or economical, as well as the means to disseminate this information rapidly so that it can be adopted by those battling invasive species. Some pests are

Hawaii Interagency Biosecurity Plan 2017–2027

45

December 2016

beyond the threshold to eradicate or cost effectively control. Biocontrol is recognized as a key tool for managing established invasive species, particularly insects and the most damaging weeds (Loope and Kraus 2009, HISC 2015). Current facilities for the PPC Branch, including biocontrol research facilities, are outdated and not fully equipped.

To address gaps in staffing in its invasive species control program, HDOA will need to triple the staffing in its PPC Branch; double the size of HDOA’s Biological Control Section staff; and build a new office complex, laboratories, and research facility for chemical/mechanical control and biocontrol efforts. HDOA also will update its Animal Industry Division offices and laboratories to monitor and control high-risk animal diseases. HDOA will also need to add new staff members to coordinate statewide surveillance and monitoring programs for high-risk pests, and add operating funds for these programs.

DLNR likewise has technology, funding, and staffing needs that it must meet to expand its control programs and fill gaps in its terrestrial biosecurity program (PosTifs1). Additional staffing needs include forest health specialists and a forest pathologist to monitor, detect, and manage high-risk pathogens like Rapid Ohia Death. DOFAW manages more than 800,000 acres of forests, and expanding its monitoring of insects and disease threats is critical to protect watersheds. To detect, monitor, remove, and control invasive species in all stateprotected areas, including forests and watersheds, additional field crews will be needed. Extending support to private landowners who manage critical watersheds and native species habitat to assist with invasive species control, is a strategy that will enable more regional approaches to invasive species control (PosTifs1, PosTifs2).

A great deal of the support that goes directly to farmers and ranchers in rural communities to help them manage and control invasive species on their properties comes from UH agricultural extension programs in CTAHR. Providing assistance to county farmers and ranchers was identified as a gap in the workshop. Hiring additional UH agricultural and aquaculture extension agents, extension specialists, and researchers both to help control pests on farms, nurseries, and ranches and in surrounding areas and to develop screening and quarantine protocols tailored to Hawaii’s needs addresses that gap. Hiring diagnosticians to provide insect and disease identification services for the program will also provide critical support services and is needed. UH also can help county government efforts to support the agricultural community by providing cooperative agreements for its extension agents or ISC staff members to work directly on invasive species control initiatives of concern to the county and work directly with county farmers and ranchers. Another major initiative for the UH is to create and fund positions for ISCs’ staff in the university system, which will institutionalize the role of ISCs in the biosecurity program.

December 2016

A major gap identified during stakeholder meetings

was the threat that invasive species introduced to one

island would spread to other islands. There is great

concern that Rapid Ohia Death on Hawaii Island will

spread to the other islands; that the coffee berry borer

on Hawaii Island and Oahu will spread to Kauai, Maui,

Molokai, and Lanai; that the coconut rhinoceros

beetle, in spite of its limited distribution and the

ongoing eradication efforts on Oahu, might spread to

other islands; and that the little fire ant will continue

to spread throughout the state. Similarly, the current

interisland movement of commercial and recreational vessels that are encrusted with hull-fouling organisms facilitates the spread of AIS between islands. DAR

identified vessel biofouling as the most common pathway for the introduction of alien marine and estuarine

species (DLNR 2016).

This HIBP identifies a combination of policy actions, program developments, and staffing and resource increases to prevent the interisland spread of invasive species between islands (PosPol1, PosPro2, PosTifs1). In the near term, a key strategy to achieve this goal will be to focus on preventing known risks from moving between islands, rather than identifying all biosecurity risks associated with interisland transport. Needed revisions to policy include passing statutes and rules to authorize HDOA to screen and inspect nonagricultural commodities (the agency already has limited authority to inspect some agricultural products) in interisland transport, amending rules for stricter regulation of interisland movement of pests and pathogens, regulating the interisland movement of soil, and requiring the use of the emanifest system to track and screen products in interisland shipments (PosPol1). The emanifest system should be designed to be user friendly for the public and industry and should focus on identifying known risks to target for inspection efforts. The plan also includes a policy task directed at preventing the inadvertent movement of marine invasive species by establishing new laws and rules that require both commercial and recreational watercraft moving between islands to be free of hull-fouling organisms and implementing and using a system to track and report compliance (PosPol1).

Invasive species are found on different islands and affect different resources and therefore fall under different agency jurisdictions. For these reasons, invasive species issues are multiagency, cross-sector issues with no single agency acting as the lead. Currently, invasive species are addressed by a complex set of programs housed in different agencies with a mix of inadequate funding sources. Although the HISC was established to coordinate among these programs, the current structure of the HISC does not provide dedicated staffing or funding, nor does it provide a process for nongovernment (e.g., industry) representation on the HISC. A policy initiative in the plan is establishing an autonomous Hawaii Invasive Species Authority, with additional board seats for industry and subject matter experts, to resolve these organizational and coordination limitations and give

Hawaii Interagency Biosecurity Plan 2017–2027

47

December 2016

industry a seat at the table to help develop ways to more effectively control invasive species, streamline regulatory processes, and work together on common goals. The plan also includes funding support for staffing and a competitive grant program to support projects that fill gaps in other agency programs (PosPol2, PosTifs1).

HDOA’s Animal Industry Division manages animal disease detection, screening, and control of outbreaks in the state. Management activities for the program include surveys for the presence of diseases of high concern (brucellosis, pseudorabies, tuberculosis) and effective response and control if they are detected. Animal Industry Division inspectors and veterinary medical staff members have responsibilities to protect animal and public health and engage with producers to promote good animal husbandry practices in order to prevent and control disease outbreaks and enhance local food security. Postborder tasks in the plan that support these objectives include using veterinary certification program data to track the movement of farm animals to prevent and control the spread of disease, developing agreements with county waste management facilities to accommodate disposal of diseased carcasses in the event of a disease outbreak, and providing updated office and laboratory facilities for the administration of the program and investigation of animal diseases that affect food security and human health.

Specific objectives and implementation tasks related to policy, process, and infrastructure and funding resources needed to enhance postborder security in Hawaii are listed below.

3.4 Public Awareness and Support

Goal: Enhance Public Awareness and Support for Hawaii Biosecurity

3.4.1 Background
Engaging the community has been shown to be a valuable way to address biosecurity concerns (Warren 2006, HISC 2014, Burnett and Coffman 2015, USN 2015), but in general the residents of Hawaii may not fully appreciate the invasive species problem or the biosecurity threats to our state (Burnett and Coffman 2015, HISC 2015, Rago and Sugano 2015). Enhancing awareness and building public engagement for a comprehensive biosecurity program are essential to gaining the support of the general public, policymakers, and industry for the program. As an additional benefit, an educated and engaged community would assist with detecting and reporting on invasive species, helping to prevent their spread and establishment. Early detection and notification is the key to successful eradication. Inspectors and control staff will not always be in the right place at the right moment to achieve early detection. Having a community that is watchful and knowledgeable about how to report their detections is extremely valuable.

Much progress has been made with invasive species education and

outreach. HDOA, DLNR, and DOH all have communications staff

members and programs that provide information on invasive species to

the public. HISC funds specific outreach projects and outreach staff in

the ISCs through its competitive grant program. CGAPS has conducted

public outreach campaigns and public opinion surveys on invasive

species and has a goal to continue to educate the public and decision

makers regarding preventing the introduction of invasive species to

Hawaii (Burnett and Coffman 2015). County ISCs distribute educational

materials targeting statewide or county-specific invasive species issues

(HISC 2015). Even with this concerted effort on the part of agencies and partners to inform the public, many of the participants in the workshops conducted for this plan identified outreach as one of the most important

actions to include. The plan provides for many new projects, additional communication specialists staff in

HDOA and the UH, and operational support to launch outreach campaigns to meet this need (PwsPro3,

PwsTifs2).

Hawaii Interagency Biosecurity Plan 2017–2027

56

December 2016

One of the issues identified during the planning process as a gap is the relative lack of targeted messages for different audiences. Messaging targeted at specific audiences, including those responsible for invasive species introductions, is a critical need (DLNR 2003, HDOA 2007, Hauk et al. 2009). Targeted messages to the agricultural industry, nonprofit agricultural associations, conservation groups, native Hawaiian groups, realtors, homeowners associations, and other interested communities can develop partnerships to facilitate the prevention and control of invasive species (PwsPro3). Similarly, Hawaii lacks an aggressive and organized effort to make visitors aware of the invasive species issue, problem, and regulations in Hawaii, so most visitors are unaware that they are a part of the pest introduction problem (Warren 2006, DeNitto et al. 2015). Key strategies identified during the planning process include developing a campaign targeted at visitors. Done in collaboration with the Hawaii Tourism Authority (HTA), the campaign would target visitors before their arrival, in flight, and during their stay with key messages, including the importance of biosecurity to Hawaii (PwsPro3). The campaign would include new signs and displays regarding biosecurity at airports (PwsTifs1).

Likewise, aquatic education specialists have tasks to target harbor workers, the transportation industry, and the general public with messages about harm done when live AIS are discarded (PwsPro3). HDOA Animal Industry staff would engage the veterinary medical community to participate in detection of diseases of high concern (PwsPro1). The plan also provides resources to hire communications staff members for the UH’s CTAHR Office of Communications Services to create comprehensive education and outreach materials targeted at a wide range of audiences, including the native Hawaiian community, tourists, boaters, nursery growers, livestock producers, and farmers with specific invasive species messages (PwsTifs2).

Another approach to reach the public involves

inspiring Hawaii residents to engage in addressing

biosecurity threats (PwsPro1). Key strategies

identified during the planning process include

producing materials that highlight successes of the

biosecurity program and presenting stories about

HDOA inspectors’ firsthand experience in

preventing the introduction of pests to Hawaii.

These materials should foster a sense of pride and

encourage the public to take responsibility for

protecting Hawaii’s agriculture, environment,

Community outreach events help educate and engage

culture, and lifestyle. Another strategy is to

residents and visitors on biosecurity issues. (Source: CGAPS) encourage Hawaii residents to use locally produced

plants and animals rather than imports, which often harbor harmful pests or disease, and to publicize and

promote the use of the certified nurseries program for local products.

The successful development and implementation of a comprehensive biosecurity program require the support of the state’s policymakers. An objective of the plan is to keep the state’s policymakers informed of biosecurity

57

December 2016

issues (PwsPro2). This is particularly important because turnover in policy-making positions is high and both new and incumbent office holders need to be kept informed about invasive species issues. Strategies to meet this objective include encouraging the native Hawaiian community and cultural practitioners to advocate for culturally based biosecurity programs and to organize and advocate for stronger and more effective biosecurity programs with their legislators, and encouraging HDOA staff to provide briefings to lawmakers on program successes.

Providing an education about invasive species in schools was identified as a needed step for greater public awareness. The Hawaii Department of Education has strict guidelines on curriculum, and it may require legislation or approval by the Board of Education for policy to require that biosecurity and invasive species issues be included in the environmental science K–12 curriculum. One policy task included in the plan is to propose necessary legislation and work with the Board of Education to achieve this step (PwsPol1). Tasks were included to expand university-level teaching, both classroom and research, on biosecurity problems and solutions to provide an educated and trained workforce for biosecurity programs in the future (PwsPro3, PwsTifs1).

Promoting greater public awareness would require

not only traditional methods of community

outreach, such as meetings, posters, letters, and

email, but also more efficient technology,

equipment, and staffing (PwsTifs1, PwsTifs2).

Effective outreach requires using the most up-to-

date technology and tools. Some of the key

approaches identified during the planning process

include building a state-of-the-art pest notification

and reporting system, building a comprehensive

biosecurity website and portal to provide key

information to partners and the public, developing social media applications to engage the public and build support for addressing biosecurity issues, and

Involving communities in invasive species management can create a sense of pride and responsibility regarding dealing with biosecurity issues in Hawaii. (Source: CGAPS)

hiring dedicated communications specialists and a natural resource economist as agency staff members to

support and implement the outreach program.

Protecting the health of the public, as well as the state’s livestock and poultry industries, requires a comprehensive and modern pest and disease notification and reporting system able to effectively communicate the most current information about disease occurrence and to initiate actions to prevent or control the entry or spread of pests and diseases (PwsTifs1, PwsTifs2). HDOA’s Animal Industry staff needs to engage producers and the veterinary medical community to keep informed when incidences of diseases of high concern occur, provide other biosecurity and food safety notifications, and promote good agricultural practices and production of local food items (PwsPro1). If disease outbreaks do occur, successful animal disease containment

58

December 2016

rests on the foundation of good, swift communication of risk in the affected industry and to the general public. Timely notification of disease occurrence in the community greatly influences the final cost of containment, eradication, and recovery (PwsPro3). Development and use of a variety of communication tools, such as social media, industry newsletters, and industry websites, will provide the staff with the tools to more effectively protect the animal livestock industries and safeguard public health (PwsPro1 and PwsPro3).

Specific objectives and implementation tasks related to policy, process, and infrastructure and funding resources needed to enhance public awareness and support in Hawaii are listed below.

Section 4.0 Analysis of Tasks and Funding

4.1 Analysis of Biosecurity Implementation Tasks
This HIBP identifies 147 implementation tasks that are spread across the four biosecurity program areas (preborder, border, postborder, and public awareness and support) and that represent a rough estimate of the proposed effort. Prevention actions make up the largest effort, 51% of the tasks, which represents the combined preborder (24%, 35) and border (27%, 40) actions (Figure 4.1). This allocation of effort is consistent with the basic principle of biosecurity: to focus more effort on actions to prevent the introduction of invasive species, which can in turn help avoid unnecessary and costly control efforts in the future. Control efforts, or postborder program actions, constitute 32% (47) of the tasks. Twenty-five, or 17%, of the actions identified in this HIBP relate to increasing public awareness and support for Hawaii’s residents and visitors. In general, most of the tasks in each of the program areas were process related rather than policy or resource (technology, infrastructure, funding, and staffing) related (Figure 4.1).

Figure 4.1. Percentage of Biosecurity Implementation Tasks by Program Area and by Type of Action
From the perspective of the type of actions, most of the tasks (68, 46%) are related to implementing new processes and program initiatives, followed by tasks to develop or secure resources of staffing, funding, infrastructure, or technology (45, 31%). The lowest number (34, 23%) of implementation tasks were policy related (i.e., related to updating protocols or administrative rules or formulating new legislation) (Figure 4.2).

Figure 4.2. Percentage of Hawaii Interagency Biosecurity Plan Tasks by Type of Action
HDOA, as the primary agency involved in all aspects of biosecurity, is the lead on 93 tasks or is responsible for implementing 63% of the plan (Figure 4.3). Its efforts are broadly spread across all program areas, with the largest number of tasks identified in the preborder (31%) and border (27%) program areas. DLNR is the lead agency on 41 (28%) implementation tasks, which includes management of both terrestrial species and AIS programs. Its effort is also spread across all programs areas, but unlike HDOA its largest focus is on postborder (44%) control efforts (Figure 4.3). UH is the lead on nine (6%) tasks involving postborder control and public awareness and support. Its postborder actions primarily involve pest control support for agriculture through CTAHR’s research and extension programs. DOH is the primary lead on three tasks (2%), two border and one public awareness and support, involving its vector control program and prevention of human diseases coming into the state. The counties are identified as lead on one task (1%): providing funding to UH extension programs to support pest control efforts in the farming industry in their counties. Of the 147 tasks, 11 tasks have HDOA, DLNR, UH, DOH, or county identified as coleads for implementation.

4.2 Analysis of Funds Required
4.2.1 Overall Costs
The costs described in this HIBP represent the agencies’ best estimates of what it would take to implement a realistic but effective biosecurity system. Actual costs associated with implementing this plan may change over time and will depend on both the ability of agencies to implement these tasks and the political will to provide needed policy and funding support. Over the course of 10 years, full implementation of the HIBP will cost approximately $378 million, of which $318 million (84%) are personnel and operating costs and other expenses and $60million (16%) are costs for CIPs for the construction of new facilities (Table 4.1). The operating costs generally increase over time as new staff members are hired and the extent of services increases incrementally over 10 years (Table 4.1). The construction costs of $60 million planned for the first 4 years (FY2018–2019 and FY2020–2021) include costs to build an urgently needed new office complex for HDOA’s PPC Branch, new

The overall cost of the plan is a significant investment on the part of the state to implement an effective biosecurity system. When put into context with the overall cost of government, the annual average cost of $37.8 million to fully implement the plan is 0.3% of the state’s annual $13.7 billion budget (SOH 2016). The Legislative Reference Bureau estimated annual spending of $57 million on invasive species activities by all state, county, and federal agencies in 2014. Of that amount, state agencies spent $42 million in state, federal, and other funds, including special fund cargo fees (Rago and Sugano 2015). When combined, the current state spending plus the additional funds needed to implement the plan total 0.6% of the state’s annual budget. The need for additional support and ideas on how to fund the plan were suggested at the agency, stakeholder, and public meetings. A variety of ideas were suggested, including seeking increased support from general funds, securing more federal funds, establishing a special fund for biosecurity, increasing inspection fees on incoming cargo and passengers, increasing state taxes, and asking the visitor industry to help pay its share.
4.2.2 Costs by Program Area
Preborder costs rely primarily on compliance agreements or actions taken by other jurisdictions, and as such make up only 3% of the costs outlined in this HIBP (Figure 4.4). Ninety-four percent of the budget will support border (26%) and postborder (68%) efforts (Figure 4.4). This amount is not surprising because these program areas require the greatest increases in program infrastructure in the form of new facilities and increased staffing to implement the initiatives to detect and respond to pest incursions at the borders, control high-impact established invasive species in agricultural and natural areas, and prevent their spread between islands.

The highest (68%) cost of postborder efforts involves major program efforts by HDOA, DLNR, and UH to implement 32% of the tasks (Figure 4.1) in the plan. These funds will cover containing and controlling harmful

established pests throughout the state, including constructing new biocontrol facilities, offices and laboratory facilities for plant pest control and animal disease control and adding new staff members, equipment, and technology to effectively control established pests and prevent their spread between islands. These high future costs for control are the consequence of Hawaii’s prior history of frequent introduction and establishment of invasive species. The only option agencies have to address these harmful established pests is to continue to contain or control their spread and minimize their impact on high-value resources—sometimes through difficult and expensive mechanisms, such as landscape-scale chemical and mechanical control.

This HIBP builds on the fact that prevention is the most cost-effective strategy to manage invasive species. In contrast to postborder activities, only 29% of the budget (Figure 4.4) will be needed to implement 51% of the implementation tasks (24% preborder plus 27% border tasks, Figure 4.1) planned to prevent the entry of harmful pests into the state. Prevention tasks include adding adequate monitoring, detection, and inspection capacity to prevent introductions and providing resources for emergency responses.

Public Awareness 3%

Preborder 3%

Border 26%

Postborder 68%

Figure 4.4. Hawaii Interagency Biosecurity Plan Funding by Program Area
Public awareness and support accounts for a relatively small portion (3%) of the overall plan costs (Figure 4.4). This cost is low because public awareness and support tasks will largely involve existing staff members and will add relatively few new positions over the course of the plan (see Section 4.2.4, “New Hires”). However, it should be noted that various other programs supported in this HIBP also provide funding through their competitive grant programs awarded to CGAPS, the ISCs, and watershed partnerships for public outreach and education projects, and those amounts are not reflected in this total.

4.2.3 Costs by Agency
HDOA, which has the broadest responsibilities in all four program areas and the largest share of implementation tasks, will require the largest amount of funding ($264 million, or 70%) over 10 years with an average of approximately $26.4 million per year (Table 4.2, Figure 4.5) to carry out its responsibilities.

UH

Figure 4.5. Hawaii Interagency Biosecurity Plan 10-Year Cost by Agency
Within this budget, the largest program costs (approximately $157 million, 60% of HDOA funds) are for implementing its postborder program primarily because of increases in staffing for the PPC Branch, building new facilities for the PPC Branch and AI Division, and forming the Hawaii Invasive Species Authority to coordinate and implement interagency efforts for invasive species management. During the last 4 years of the plan, if the ISCs are successfully institutionalized in the UH system (i.e., they create and fund core positions), then fewer funds will be needed by HDOA for postborder program efforts. The second largest (approximately $89 million, 34%, Table 4.2) share of HDOA funds will go toward its border program, which includes an increase in staffing for the PQ Branch and AI Division.

* The amount of funding requested by HDOA (for Hawaii Invasive Species Authority competitive grant programs) may be reduced if the ISCs become part of the UH budget under the postborder control program.

To implement its responsibilities across all programs areas, DLNR will require approximately $77 million, or 20% (Figure 4.5, Table 4.2) of the plan costs over 10 years with an average of $7.7 million per year. Out of the $77 million, the vast majority ($72 million, 93%) of program costs for DLNR will be dedicated to early detection, monitoring, and statewide control of established terrestrial and aquatic pests, and expansion of its ballast water and hull-fouling program staff and resources.

The UH will require $28 million, or approximately 7%, in funding support over the 10-year period (Figure 4.5, Table 4.2) of the plan with an average cost of $2.8 million per year. The bulk ($14.3 million, 51%) of UH’s requested funds will be used to hire research and extension agents to provide pest control and plant pest and disease diagnostic and other research services to farmers, ranchers, and the nursery growers through CTAHR’s cooperative extension programs. Additional ($5.4 million, 19%) UH funds will also go to CTAHR to expand university-level teaching and research on biosecurity and provide outreach and education to targeted stakeholder groups through its communication programs. The increase in funding for UH during the last 4 years of the plan ($8.4 million, 30%) will be needed to create and fund 27 core positions for the ISCs at the county level, providing sustained support for its invasive species management programs.

DOH will require $5.8 million in funding support, representing 2% of the overall plan costs (Figure 4.5, Table 4.2). DOH responsibilities under the plan will focus on the agency’s role in implementing the vector control program to prevent the introduction and spread of human disease. The plan proposes to restore staff and field capacity of the vector control program, to monitor and control vectors of human disease, such as mosquitoes

and rat lungworm. Much of DOH’s Vector Control Branch program capacity was lost in previous staff layoffs (see Section 4.2.4, “New Hires”).
The counties also have a role in supporting and implementing the plan. They are the lead on one task: providing annual funding to the UH extension programs to assist county farmers and ranchers with responding in a timely manner to new pest incursions and managing established invasive species. Under the plan, each county will provide $100,000 per year for the duration of the plan to directly support their county farmers and ranchers. Maui County in 2016 funded operational costs for UH extension agents, and its successful program serves as a model to other counties.
4.2.4 New Hires
Budget cuts following the economic recession in 2008 caused several state agencies to lose many staff positions. Some agencies in FY2017 are still struggling to restore that lost capacity. For example, HDOA’s PI Division had a staff of 147 positions in 2008 and lost many positions soon after. Despite economic improvement, the staff capacity in 2016 (121 positions) is still below that in 2008 (Figure 4.6). The PI Division comprises the PPC and the PQ Branches, which primarily execute HDOA’s biosecurity program. A reduction in staff positions in these two branches has significantly affected the state’s biosecurity functions.

A total of 288 new positions will be added across the four lead biosecurity agencies (HDOA, DLNR, UH, and DOH) over the 10-year span of the plan. To carry out their ongoing and new responsibilities outlined in this HIBP, HDOA will require 172, UH 44, DLNR 59, and DOH 13 new positions. In general, the staff will increase incrementally over the course of the 10-year period as the program initiatives are launched over time.

December 2016

To execute the existing and new biosecurity initiatives identified in this HIBP, an increase of 93% (172 positions) in PI and AI Division staffs combined (PI Division positions: increase from 121 to 278, 130% increase; AI Division positions: increase from 63 to 78, 24% increase) is planned for HDOA over the next 10 years (Figure 4.7). This significant increase in HDOA’s staff capacity will largely go to enhance border protection by ramping up the urgently needed inspections of agricultural and nonagricultural products (later, after appropriate regulations are in place) at Hawaii’s borders, as well as inspection of commodities transported interisland. Positions added to postborder programs at HDOA will contribute to established plant pest control in agricultural and natural areas. Thirteen positions will be added to preborder programs to develop the needed changes in policy and regulations, conduct risk analysis for imports, and manage the biosecurity database and emanifest system. Positions of biosecurity communications specialist and natural resource economist at HDOA will guarantee focused and consistent biosecurity outreach not only to Hawaii’s stakeholders but to its visitors. Fifty-one of the 59 positions being added to DLNR will support postborder biosecurity efforts (Figure 4.7). These efforts will include control of established invasive plants and animals in Hawaii’s watersheds and other natural areas and monitoring of forest health conditions statewide. Six positions related to ballast water and hull fouling programs will support border protection. Two positions will be added to the AIS preborder program to conduct risk analysis on vessels, pathways, and on organisms entering Hawaii via ballast water, hull fouling, aquaculture and pet industry pathways.

Thirty-nine of the 44 new positions at UH will support postborder biosecurity programs. These new positions at UH will staff ISCs for early detection and control, and extension agents and researchers at CTAHR’s cooperative extension program to assist farmers and ranchers with control of agricultural pests and diagnostic services. Three technical staff members will also be hired at CTAHR’s Office of Communications Services to write, develop, and disseminate new statewide comprehensive education and outreach materials targeting

specific key audiences. Two instructors/researchers will be added to expand university-level instruction both in the classroom and in the field to research biosecurity issues and produce an educated and trained workforce for biosecurity programs in the future.
The 13 new positions that will be added at DOH over the next 10 years will staff its Vector Control Branch and will protect human health by helping prevent the introduction and spread of disease-causing vectors, such as mosquitoes. It should be noted that Figure 4.6 identifies staffing capacity for DOH’s Environmental Health Services, which provides vector control in addition to many other services. Shortly after the recession began in 2008, DOH’s Vector Control Branch was decommissioned. A dengue outbreak in Hawaii, among other biosecurity issues, was instrumental in driving home the importance of reinstating DOH’s Vector Control Branch, and it was only in FY2017 that 20 new positions were restored to this branch. Depending on the type of threat to public health in the state, it is possible that DOH might need more than the 13 positions budgeted for in this HIBP.
4.3 Analysis of Task Prioritization
As discussed in Section 2.0, “Introduction,” each lead agency prioritized the implementation tasks for which it was designated as the lead. The priority ranking was subjectively based on the following criteria: 1= critical for effective biosecurity, 2 = strongly beneficial for effective biosecurity, and 3 = generally beneficial for effective biosecurity.
4.3.1 Priority Ranking by Type of Action and Program Area
Of the 147 tasks, 69 tasks (47%) were identified as Priority 1, critical for effective biosecurity; 45 tasks (31%) were identified as Priority 2, strongly beneficial; and 33 tasks (22%) were identified as Priority 3, generally beneficial. Of the Priority 1 tasks, 19 (13%) were policy actions, 20 (14%) were process actions, and 30 (20%) were resource-related (technology, infrastructure, funding, and staffing) actions, emphasizing the importance of securing more resources for existing and new tasks across all program areas (Figure 4.8).

Figure 4.8. Priority Ranking of Number of Biosecurity Implementation Tasks by Type of Action
Among the Priority 1 tasks, the combined number for preborder (20) and border (19) tasks represents the highest (39, 27%) number of implementation tasks compared to other program areas and prioritization categories (Figure 4.9). Similar to the allocation of effort (as discussed in Section 4.1), this prioritization is also consistent with the basic principal of biosecurity wherein a larger number of preborder and border program area tasks to prevent the introduction of invasive species fall in the highest-priority (Priority 1) category.

4.3.2 Costs by Priority Ranking Overall, Priority 1 tasks, or the tasks that are critical for an effective biosecurity program, will require the greatest share of the overall budget: 75% ($283 million) of the estimated 10-year costs (Figure 4.10). Priority 2 and Priority 3 tasks will require 12% ($44 million) and 13% ($50 million), respectively, of the overall costs. It is not surprising that almost all of the Priority 1 funds and approximately 70% of the Priority 2 funds will be needed for resource-related tasks. The costs associated with supporting urgently needed technology (e.g., updating and installing new databases) and infrastructure (e.g., biocontrol and AI Division facilities) and hiring new staff members are higher compared to the costs associated with policy- or process-related tasks, most of which are planned to be executed using existing staff members and resources. Although the industry and other stakeholders were not involved in the prioritization, in general, these urgently needed resource-related tasks also were supported by them and the public participants involved in the planning process.

Over the 10-year life of the plan, HDOA will require the largest share ($234 million) of the total budget to implement the largest number (45) of tasks that fall in the Priority 1 category. DLNR’s critical tasks will cost $28 million, UH’s critical tasks will cost $16 million, and DOH’s critical tasks will cost $5.8 million. An additional $94 million will be needed to implement the remaining Priority 2 and 3 tasks of all the agencies (Figure 4.11).
