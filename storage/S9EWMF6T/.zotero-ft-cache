Progress in Biological Control
Series Preface
Biological control of pests, weeds, and plant and animal diseases utilising their natural antagonists is a well-established and rapidly evolving ﬁeld of science. Despite its stunning successes world-wide and a steadily growing number of applications, biological control has remained grossly underexploited. Its untapped potential, however, represents the best hope to providing lasting, environmentally sound, and socially acceptable pest management. Such techniques are urgently needed for the control of an increasing number of problem pests affecting agriculture and forestry, and to suppress invasive organisms which threaten natural habitats and global biodiversity.
Based on the positive features of biological control, such as its target speciﬁcity and the lack of negative impacts on humans, it is the prime candidate in the search for reducing dependency on chemical pesticides. Replacement of chemical control by biological control – even partially as in many IPM programs – has important positive but so far neglected socio-economic, humanitarian, environmental and ethical implications. Change from chemical to biological control substantially con- tributes to the conservation of natural resources, and results in a considerable reduc- tion of environmental pollution. It eliminates human exposure to toxic pesticides, improves sustainability of production systems, and enhances biodiversity. Public demand for ﬁnding solutions based on biological control is the main driving force in the increasing utilisation of natural enemies for controlling noxious organisms.
This book series is intended to accelerate these developments through exploring the progress made within the various aspects of biological control, and via documenting these advances to the beneﬁt of fellow scientists, students, public ofﬁcials, policymakers, and the public at large. Each of the books in this series is expected to provide a comprehensive, authoritative synthesis of the topic, likely to stand the test of time.

Preface
One of the main reasons that we organized this edited volume is to increase international awareness of the growing use of invertebrate pathogens for control and eradication of invasive arthropods. As the numbers of invasive species continues to rise, more insect pathologists have been involved with work on their control using entomopathogens. In fact, this is not a new area of focus for insect pathologists; work on microbes against invasive arthropods began more than a century ago with classical biological control introductions of entomopathogenic fungi against invasive species in the 1890s. Chapters in this book cover entomopathogens that have been developed for control of invasive species over many decades (e.g. a nematode against Sirex noctilio and Bacillus thuringiensis against gypsy moth) while other chapters focus on development of control measures for very recent invasives (e.g. emerald ash borer ﬁrst found in the US in 2002). Since both the United States and New Zealand are countries with abundant trade, which is a key pathway for invasives, we have been very aware of the growing numbers of invasive pests arriving in our own countries and the need for control strategies. We have been closely involved with their control using microbes, at varying levels (from laboratory bench to ﬁeld studies to national committees evaluating eradication programs using the entomopathogen B. thuringiensis).
Within the past few years, symposia on use of microbes for invasive control have been organized twice at the annual meetings of the Society of Invertebrate Pathology (2005 – Anchorage, Alaska, and 2007 – Quebec City, Quebec, Canada), demonstrating interest in this subject across the international community of invertebrate pathologists. However, no written summaries, covering the different types of pathogens being studied, developed and used for control, have previously addressed this subject. This could be due to the fact that the subject is very diverse, including programs using very different microbes (viruses, bacteria, fungi, protists and nematodes) in a diversity of contexts: from eradication of new populations of invasive species, to control of established populations of invasives as well as basic studies of host/pathogen interactions and epizootiology. Especially for eradication programs, the lack of written summaries may also relate to the practical focus of these programs, which are about applied pest control rather than research. We hope that those working with invasive arthropods will ﬁnd this book useful as a resource and that it will serve to support further work on this subject as well as, eventually, increased use of entomopathogens for control of invasives.

Introduction

Chapter 1
Invasive Arthropods and Approaches for Their Microbial Control
Ann E. Hajek

Abstract Invasive arthropod species cause ever-increasing economic, environmental and public health problems. Microbes (i.e. viruses, bacteria, fungi, nematodes and protists) have been used very successfully for eradicating and controlling a range of invasive arthropods in diverse ecosystems worldwide. Many eradication and control programs using microbes have used inundative augmentation (widespread application) approaches while some control programs have instead focused on classical biological control (point release and natural spread). This chapter provides a short history of past use of microbes for control of invasive arthropods as well as an introduction to the subjects that will be covered in this book.
1.1 Globalization and Invasive Species
Throughout history, arthropods have always competed with humans for managed and unmanaged resources as well as causing problems to public health. Initially, arthropods that became pestiferous were native species, but as humans began dispersing to new areas, the arthropods associated with humans, their domesticated animals and crop plants accompanied them. A few of the movements of arthropods have been purposeful and beneﬁcial to humans, such as introducing honeybees for pollination and honey production or introducing arthropod biological control agents. However, the vast majority of introductions have been accidental and usually this dispersal is made possible through human means. (Of course, natural dispersal occurs too but this is slow and takes place over evolutionary times, doesn’t usually cross biogeographic borders and usually occurs in only one direction (Nentwig 2007b)). While some introduced species have had little impact, failing to establish or not competing strongly for local resources, a low percentage become established and populations have grown, resulting in crop damage, displacement of indigenous species or adversely impacting animal or public health.

Given the difﬁculties in detection of small arthropods, many of which exhibit secretive behaviors, along with the constantly increasing movement of items and people around the world, the numbers of arthropods being introduced to new areas are increasing at an alarming rate. It has been estimated that in the United States alone (including Hawaii), 4,500 arthropod species have been introduced (Pimentel et al. 2005). We regularly hear of the detection of new invasive species partly due to the ever-increasing rate of new introductions and partly due to improved surveillance methods, reﬂecting the recognition of the serious risks associated with invasive arthropods. While agriculture began about 10,000 years ago, probably leading to the ﬁrst major movements of pests, the date that Columbus discovered America is often accepted as an arbitrary timing for the beginning of what we now call ‘biological invasions’ (Nentwig 2007a). Thus, after Columbus’ voyages to America approximately 500 years ago, faster movement of people and goods was possible and, with improvements in transportation methods and availability, the age of globalization began. To aid in globalization, global regulatory organizations work toward facilitating exchanges of goods between all nations, eliminating obstructions to free trade. As global trade increases, so does accidental movements of organisms. Unfortunately, global regulations have not been put in place to prevent the increasing numbers of invasions. For example, in the United States alone, in 1800 only 50 alien arthropods were recorded as established; by 1990, 2000 invasive arthropods had become established (OTA 1993).
Improved transportation speed, access and availability have facilitated dispersal of hitchhiking arthropods from areas where they are native to areas where they are exotic, or alien. Various methods have led to arthropods breaching the biogeographic barriers that deﬁned the original distributions of species. Unintentionally introduced species have been transported as tramps in vehicles, ships and planes; faster means of transportation now allow introductions of species that in past years would not have survived slower voyages over long distances (Nentwig 2007b). For example, cockroach and ant species that are native to more tropical areas would not be able to survive months of transport across colder areas but, when moved quickly by protected means (e.g. within an airplane), they are able to survive and thus some have now been introduced globally as tramps. Some species are transported by waterways and through shipping. The alfalfa snout beetle, Otiorhynchus ligustici, was most probably transported in ballast from England to northern New York State (Shields et al. 2004). Other species have been introduced with living plants, with harvested plant material including various types of wood or with soil associated with plants (Nentwig 2007b). The global growth in business travel, tourism and immigration from one continent to another adds to possibilities for transporting arthropods that might become introduced to new areas.
In fact, only a small fraction of species that are introduced become established over the long-term (Simberloff & Gibbons 2004) and only a small fraction of those becoming established cause serious problems (Williamson 1996). The alien species that become established and have potential to or actually cause economic or environmental harm, or harm to human health are termed ‘invasive species’ (National Invasive Species Council 2000). This is a subjective and broad deﬁnition.

The necessity to address problems due to invasive species is viewed differently by those mostly interested in preserving native biodiversity versus those purely interested in whether non-native species that have been introduced are having an economic impact.
We have seen that it does not take many new species well-suited to exploiting a new habitat to create catastrophic problems; sometimes only one species can monopolize or take over a previously diverse and balanced ecosystem and change it irreversibly. Ecologists have been very intrigued by the question of what allows a species to become a damaging invasive, especially because in many cases these pests are not pests in their areas of origin. Among the ecological hypotheses that have been proposed, some ecologists think that species that become invasives are pre-adapted to the new environment or are superior in some way when compared with native species (Hufbauer & Torchin 2007). Another hypothesis that has long received support is that when new species enter new environments, they are not accompanied by the natural enemies controlling their populations in their area of origin (= enemy release hypothesis); this hypothesis is supported by the fact that many invasives do not cause problems in their areas of origin and can, in fact, be uncommon endemics. The evidence that introduced species have fewer natural enemies in their new environments compared with their native environments supports this hypothesis (Torchin & Mitchell 2004). It has been hypothesized that the natural enemies attacking invasive species in a new environment would be generalists rather than specialists since generalists would be more likely to shift to new host species (Torchin & Mitchell 2004, van der Putten et al. 2005).
Ecosystems that have been altered in some way may be more susceptible to being overcome by an invasive species. For example, when exotic pines were planted as monocultures over large areas in Australia, the system was ripe for an invasive species, the European woodwasp Sirex noctilio, to easily spread and kill trees (e.g. Haugen & Underdown 1990). Likewise, agricultural monocultures are highly susceptible to being overcome when invasive species that can utilize the crops being grown are introduced. In most cases, agriculture relies on exotic plant and animal species, which can be susceptible to exotic arthropods, and, in particular, those arthropods from the areas where the agricultural crop or animal originated.
Many books have chronicled the impacts of invasive species, including arthropods (e.g. Van Driesche & Van Driesche 2004). Introduced species that become invasive can have severe impacts on entire ecosystems. For example, over a 20 year period, the European balsam woolly adelgid, Adelges piceae, spread and killed over 95% of mature Fraser ﬁrs (Abies fraseri) in the southern Appalachian Mountains in the eastern US (as cited in Pimentel et al. 2002). The extensive tree mortality has been associated with regional loss of two native bird species and invasion by three other bird species due to substantial changes in the forest (Alsop & Laughlin 1991). Although Fraser ﬁr regeneration is now extensive (younger trees are less susceptible to A. piceae), stand characteristics such as age and distribution of Fraser ﬁr have been changed. The long-term impacts to the new generation of trees remains to be seen but it seems possible that the overall effect will be that these infested forests will have fewer Fraser ﬁrs (Ragenovich & Mitchell

2006). Beginning in the 19th century and through 1979, four species of wasps in the family Vespidae were introduced to New Zealand (Cook et al. 2002); New Zealand is now recorded as having the highest density of such wasps in the world. While these wasps cause abundant stings each year, they also have a strong impact on the native beech (Nothofagus spp.) forests. In particular, Vespula vulgaris and Vespula germanica reduce the crop of homopteran-secreted honeydew by >90%, thus impacting food resources of native birds (Beggs & Rees 1999). In addition, the wasps also directly impact native invertebrate biodiversity and compete with native birds for invertebrate prey. The red imported ﬁre ant, Solenopsis invicta, has spread throughout the southeastern United States where it has reduced biodiversity and harmed wildlife (Wojcik et al. 2001). In these instances, entire communities associated with invasives are affected, often leading to permanent changes in ecosystems.
In general, the impacts of invasive species on native ecosystems and biodiversity are not well documented whereas the economic impacts of invasive species have received more attention. Costs incurred as a result of invasive species take three general forms: direct costs of damage caused by invasives (e.g. productivity losses), costs of control efforts and costs of preventing new introductions. The latter is the concern of quarantine (or biosecurity) agencies and will not be covered in this book. It has been estimated that damage and control costs in the US for the imported ﬁre ant alone equal US$1 billion per year (Pimentel et al. 2005). Structural damage caused by the Formosan termite (Coptotermes formosanus) in the southern United States has been estimated at US$1 billion per year (Pimentel et al. 2005), and this estimate was made before the 2005 hurricanes that resulted in heavy infestations in ravaged areas and increased potential for this destructive termite to be dispersed by humans. It is much more difﬁcult or even impossible to put a cost to environmental changes caused by invasive species. Red imported ﬁre ants kill poultry chicks, lizards, snakes, ground-nesting birds and many native invertebrates and, while some of these can be associated with a monetary loss, it is not so easy to assign a monetary value to loss of native snakes, lizards and many invertebrates. It is likewise difﬁcult to assign a monetary value to loss of native Fraser ﬁrs (a species that is not logged) and associated communities in the forests of the Appalachian Mountains of the US.

1.2 Managing Invasive Arthropods
Exotic arthropod pests have been problematic since agriculture began and pest management strategies have been developed for these purposes. So how does controlling the ever-increasing numbers of invasive arthropods differ from controlling native arthropod pests? This book focuses on eradication and control of arthropods that are invasive because this group of pests presents unique challenges.
First, the goal of eradication is never an objective for native pests so this type of control is unique to invasive pests. To confound the difﬁculty of undertaking an

eradication campaign, newly introduced species usually initially exist at low densities and often ﬁrst invade areas with large human populations (i.e. airports and ports of entry are generally in urban centers), making control efforts more difﬁcult. Detection can be particularly difﬁcult and often invasive species are only discovered by chance. Even where routine surveys are conducted to detect invasives, the chance of successful detection is often dependent on timing of the survey and training of the operators.
Pests of agricultural crops are a mixture of native and introduced arthropods; it has been estimated that 40% of crop pests in the US have been introduced (Pimentel 1993). In New Zealand, it is estimated that 90% of invertebrate pests are aliens (Barlow & Goldson 2002). In cases where the invasive that has become established is an agricultural pest and cannot be targeted for eradication because it is already wellestablished and has spread, pest management can become more similar to control measures used for native pests. However, many invasives are pests in native ecosystems and, in these cases, standard management practices that have been developed to protect crops in agriculture and forestry are not appropriate, making control efforts more challenging. Invasive arthropods can increase to huge populations that spread like wildﬁre, leaving behind decimated native ecosystems that will never be the same. For example, the invasive emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis), ﬁrst found in the US in 2002 in southeastern Michigan, is currently spreading, already leaving behind > 20 million dead ash (Fraxinus spp.) trees (USDA Forest Service, 2007).
Spread of these new pests can be very fast and their population dynamics once they invade new areas can be chaotic; these are unique characteristics of populations of invasive arthropods and, once again, require more creative control strategies. Commonly, there is very rapid population growth of invasive pests once they are established, whereas established populations of these species in their places of origin exist at lower population densities. This ‘outbreak’ phenomenon means there can be large populations at the expanding front of a pest invasion. A newer approach for controlling invasive species that have become established and are spreading (so eradication is no longer possible) is “slow the spread’. This strategy involves aggressively targeting the leading edge of a new invasion to limit the rate of colonization of new areas (see Chapter 5). In addition, this method reduces the outbreak impact at the leading edge.
One type of control that is frequently exploited for combatting invasive arthropods is classical biological control; this strategy is deﬁned as ‘the intentional introduction of an exotic biological control agent for permanent establishment and long-term pest control’ (Eilenberg et al. 2001). In fact, historically, practitioners predominantly have focused on invasive pests with classical biological programs (Brewer & Charlet 1999). This strategy is more appropriate for targeting pests occurring in habitats with some degree of permanence (e.g. wetlands, forests, orchards) where effective, environmentally safe natural enemies of invasive pests are not present or effective. It is also a strategy in keeping with the theory that invasive pests succeed due to lack of natural enemies in their new area; this strategy is based on seeking to introduce to the invaded ecosystem the natural enemies of the pest that control its populations in its area of origin.

The other control strategy used against invasive pests is inundative augmentation: ‘the use of living organisms to control pests when control is achieved exclusively by the organisms themselves that have been released’ (Eilenberg et al. 2001). This control method is similar to strategies using synthetic chemical pesticides as it seeks to kill pests by direct mass application. Thus, when living organisms are used in this way, they are often referred to as biopesticides.
Invasions occur in several phases (Liebhold & Tobin 2008) and different methods for mitigation are appropriate for each phase. First, the initial arrival of the pest can be prevented by international quarantines that restrict movement of exotics and by inspections at ports of entry. This ﬁrst phase is outside of the subject of this book but is covered in a recent review (Follett & Neven 2006). Subsequently, exotics become established, forming initial reproducing populations. Many insects fail to ﬁnd hosts that can maintain a reproductive population, or they ﬁnd conditions (i.e. winter) unsuitable for survival. Those that successfully form an initial population can be targeted for eradication if found before signiﬁcant spread has occurred. Once the population of the invasive has developed and spread, becoming part of new ecosystems, invasives can only be controlled.

1.2.1 Preventing Establishment
Often no one knows when and where invasives were ﬁrst introduced and only sometimes scientiﬁc detective work after the fact can help to trace the source and determine when and how the initial introduction occurred. When invasive pests are initially introduced, the numbers of individuals establishing are frequently very few. If the invasive is a species with a track record elsewhere, then monitoring methods have sometimes already been developed and can be used to aid in detection; in fact, customs and airport authorities are constantly searching for species that are known to be serious pests elsewhere and are also easily transported. However, methods for detection are not always available, either because the new invasive is not a pest elsewhere or simply because the species is not easy to detect, e.g. adults of wood borers that do not rely on sex pheromones can be difﬁcult to detect because a standard detection tool, pheromone traps, is thus not appropriate and, in addition, immature stages of these pests live inside wood and can escape visual inspections. The period while populations of new invasive pests are at very low densities (i.e. just after establishment) is the optimal time when eradication should be undertaken for greatest chance of success; it becomes increasingly difﬁcult or impossible to eradicate when the target is already at moderate densities and/or has already spread very far. Decisions on whether or not to undertake an eradication campaign are often based on costs and beneﬁts of the program as well as the prediction of whether success is possible (Myers et al. 2000), although sometimes politics or public attitude can inﬂuence whether or not eradication programs are conducted regardless of the economics (see Chapter 18). Of course, availability or development of

effective methods for detecting and monitoring low density populations are critically important to success in eradication. Eradication programs require blanketing the areas known to be infested with control agents to drive populations of the invasive pest below levels where they can reproduce; generally highly effective inundative augmentation methods are used. Thus, eradication programs are very expensive, they require large amounts of biopesticide and a very large crew, often needing to be available on short notice, in order to eliminate populations of the invasive pest before the population reaches higher density and spreads so that the species cannot be eradicated. In addition, it is important that authorities do not terminate eradication programs as soon as populations cannot be detected; they must continue surveillance for a time to ensure that the invasive species is truly eradicated (see Chapter 18).

1.2.2 Preventing Increase and Slowing Spread
After an invasive species has become established and is increasing in numbers and spreading, the next step often taken is implementation of a domestic quarantine to prevent movement of the pest (usually via humans) outside of the area of establishment. Alternately, barrier zones are created to prevent spread of the organism on its own. Control is easier for organisms that spread along a continuous population front. However, for organisms with the ability to travel long distances, either on their own or aided by humans, it is more difﬁcult or even impossible to halt spread.
Once a population of an invasive is established in a new area, the focus of the program changes to control. Suppressing the population should aid in decreasing problems locally as well as decreasing the chance of further long distance dispersal into more areas. Suppression of spreading populations is often through inundative augmentation, including the release of large quantities of a pathogen to decrease populations of the invasive. Inundative augmentation is also used for control of established populations of invasives, especially when their populations increase to damaging levels. A more long-term strategy for control of established invasives is introduction of exotic pathogens for permanent long term control (= classical biological control). This strategy has been used extensively through the release of herbivorous arthropods and plant pathogens for control of invasive weeds, and releases of parasitoids and predators for control of invasive arthropods. Although classical biological control of arthropods has not utilized pathogens as frequently, this is not due to lack of success but perhaps more likely due to difﬁculties in ﬁnding and working with microorganisms during foreign exploration (i.e. searching for natural enemies in the area of origin) and possibly due to less knowledge of microbiology among entomologists involved in invasive responses and classical biological control. The numerous classical biological control programs using entomopathogens, including successes, have recently been reviewed (Hajek et al. 2007) and some of those pertaining to invasive species are covered in this book.

1.3 Use of Microbes Against Invasive Arthropods

A.E. Hajek

1.3.1 Advantages of Using Microbes

Bacteria, viruses, fungi, nematodes and protists comprise the major groups of arthropod-pathogens used for eradication and control. Along with this diversity in microorganisms comes a diversity in pathogenicity (ability to infect) and virulence (speed of kill). However, in general the pathogens being used only affect arthropods and often have narrow host ranges, so they are more acceptable for use in the urban/suburban areas where invasives are often found ﬁrst. Due to differing pathogenicity and ecology, different types of arthropod pathogens are appropriate for different pests in different circumstances. For example, strains of the bacterial pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) can kill lepidopteran hosts within a day or two (Glare & O’Callaghan 2000). In addition, Bt is relatively easy to mass produce outside of insects and numerous companies sell different strains for pest control. Therefore, Bt has been used numerous times in eradication programs in urban areas (see Chapters 4 and 5). However, although Bt is a commonly occurring soil bacterium, it has rarely been known to cause epizootics and thus Bt is not considered for classical biological control programs. In contrast, the fungal pathogen Entomophaga maimaiga presently cannot be mass-produced but persists in the northeastern US, frequently causing epizootics in gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) populations. This species therefore would never be considered for an eradication campaign but is very appropriate for classical biological control as it is capable of maintaining itself in the host population. For both eradication and control programs, entomopathogens offer a natural alternative in comparison with synthetic chemical pesticides. Introductions of invasive pests often occur around ports or airports, areas with large human populations, and extensive use of synthetic chemical pesticides is not possible or is not accepted by the public. Many invasive pests attack plants growing near human habitation or they attack plants in environmentally sensitive natural areas; in either case, the public frequently prefers an environmentally benign pest control option. In many of these environments, non-target impacts on other arthropods may be of concern, so use of host speciﬁc entomopathogens is also advantageous.

1.3.2 History of Use of Pathogens for Classical Biological Control of Invasive Arthropods
Classical biological control using pathogens against arthropods was ﬁrst recorded in 1894–1895 but this strategy was used relatively little until the 1950s (Hajek et al. 2005, 2007). For introductions between 1894 and 1950 (about which there is adequate documentation) 81.8% targeted invasive insect hosts instead of native hosts. For all except one of the introductions before 1950, fungal pathogens were introduced and the principal targets were hemipterans and soil-dwelling scarabs.

For the majority (63.6%) of the 131 total release programs for which the area of endemism of the pest(s) and success in establishment could be determined, the targeted arthropod pest was an invasive and not native. The percentage of programs yielding successful establishment did not differ between programs targeting native versus invasive pests (71.4–72.4% establishment). Among the ﬁve pathogens released most commonly, the Oryctes rhinoceros virus (see Chapter 8), Entomophaga maimaiga (the fungal pathogen infecting gypsy moth) (see Chapter 11) and the nematode targeting Sirex noctilio (see Chapter 12) all targeted invasive hosts. These pathogens were used frequently because of their success in control of hosts.
Several major successes with classical biological control of invasive coniferfeeding sawﬂies in North America using viruses occurred in the mid-1900s; there are currently no on-going programs with the viruses so they are not covered elsewhere in this book and are therefore mentioned brieﬂy here. European pine sawﬂy (Neodiprion sertifer) in North America (Hajek et al. 2005) was ﬁrst reported in New Jersey in 1925 and it then spread in eastern North America (Cunningham & Entwistle 1981). A nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV) was obtained from Sweden in 1949 and was subsequently released in Canada and the USA in the early 1950s and in the UK in the early 1960s. Methods for mass production were developed and this virus was also extensively used for inundative releases by Forest Service personnel, Christmas tree growers and private individuals until 1970 when registration became necessary for further use. Outbreak populations of the invasive European spruce sawﬂy (Gilpinia hercyniae) in eastern Canada and the northeastern US were controlled by an NPV and introduced parasites; the virus was ﬁrst noted in 1936 but by 1952 it had been transferred or had spread through most infested areas (Cunningham & Entwistle 1981). This NPV had not been purposefully introduced and must have accidentally accompanied sawﬂies or parasites from Europe. The virus, in combination with parasitoids, appears to have permanently solved problems due to G. hercyniae in eastern North America.

1.3.3 History of Use of Pathogens for Inundative Augmentation of Invasive Arthropods
Metchnikoff is generally credited with being the ﬁrst to conduct experimental work on the application of entomopathogens against economically important pests (Cameron 1973, Zimmermann et al. 1995). He worked with Metarhizium anisopliae and species of crop pests that were native to eastern Europe and Russia: Anisoplia austriaca and Bothynoderes (= Cleonus) punctiventris. Subsequent use of massproduced entomopathogens for inundative control focused primarily on arthropod pests that were native or which had been moved extensively through agriculture for many years (e.g. scale insects and whiteﬂy on citrus).
However, beginning in the 1920s, research toward use of entomopathogens for control also focused on invasives that were relatively new to North America at that time: the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, and the Japanese beetle,

Popillia japonica. Although research determined that both B. thuringiensis and M. anisopliae were effective for control of corn borer, products were not developed and put to use. In the US, research on bacterial pathogens of the invasive Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica) yielded a commercially available milky disease product based on Paenibacillus popilliae, a localized bacterial species from North America. This bacterium constituted the ﬁrst insect pathogen that was approved for use by the US government, shortly after WWII (Federici 2005). To hasten spread of the pathogen, 109 tons of P. popilliae spore powder was distributed to 90 sites in 13 eastern states from 1939 to 1953 (Falcon 1971). A product based on P. popilliae is still available today in the US, since Japanese beetles continue to be a pest problem, however production is limited by in vivo methods. A nematode species Steinernema glaseri was also isolated from the Japanese beetle and appeared promising but, because of the success of milky disease, this nematode was not developed further. However, this initial work with S. glaseri is commonly credited as the beginning of microbial control with nematodes (Lord 2005).
Apparently during WWI, the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, was introduced into western Europe and it subsequently spread to the south and east. Because of much improved potato transportation, Colorado potato beetle was distributed across much of Europe by the 1940s. A Beauveria bassiana-based mycoinsecticide for control of the Colorado potato beetle (Boverin) was developed in 1965 in the former USSR (Kendrick 2000) and was used for many years (Ferron 1981) although it is not produced now (Faria & Wraight 2007). In the 1960s, B. thuringiensis products were initially commercialized and a few of the major pests targeted in the US (Federici 2005) were invasive species: gypsy moth and diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella), both native to Europe. Development of biopesticides has continued since these earlier projects and invasive arthropods continue to be among the principal targets for which microbial biopesticides are developed and used.

1.4 An Overview of Use of Microbes for Control and Eradication of Invasive Arthropods
This book is organized in sections, beginning in Part I with this introductory chapter, followed by two chapters in Part II discussing instances and implications of infection of invasives by endemic pathogens and then modeling dynamics of invasive arthropods with implications for their eradication and control with entomopathogens. The next 12 chapters all present case histories of eradication and control programs using arthropod speciﬁc pathogens; covering a diversity of approaches for a diversity of hosts and pathogens in a diversity of ecosystems. Part III includes two chapters describing and discussing eradication programs using Bacillus thuringiensis. The next ten chapters (Part IV) are case histories of control programs using entomopathogens. Chapters in Part IV are organized by the hosts, beginning with Hemiptera (1 chapter), Orthoptera (1 chapter), Coleoptera (3 chapters), Lepidoptera (1 chapter), and

1 Invasive Arthropods and Approaches for Their Microbial Control

13

Hymenoptera (2 chapters), and ﬁnishing with 2 chapters on use of pathogens for control of mites. One of the chapters on beetles (Coleoptera) is not speciﬁcally concerned with an invasive beetle but with an invasive nematode that is vectored by a native wood-boring beetle (Chapter 9). Among these chapters, all of the major groups of pathogens are included: viruses, bacteria, fungi, nematodes and protists. Some of the chapters on control cover one host and one pathogen (e.g. Chapter 14 on use of Neozygites tanajoae against cassava green mite) while others cover one host and numerous pathogens (e.g. Chapter 11 on gypsy moth includes Bacillus thuringiensis, Lymantria dispar nucleopolyhedrovirus, the fungus Entomophaga maimaiga and microsporidia). Control strategies that are covered in these chapters range from inundative augmentation to classical biological control.
In some instances, the public has been concerned about use of microbes for control of invasive arthropods, especially when control measures must take place where people live and work. Chapter 16 presents a discussion of the human health effects of B. thuringiensis, the entomopathogen that has been used most extensively for inundative applications against invasive arthropods in urban areas. Another concern that is raised is whether use of entomopathogens against invasive arthropods will affect our environment; Chapter 17 addresses non-target impacts of microbial control agents.
There have been some great successes in use of pathogens for control of invasive arthropods. The ﬁnal chapter synthesizes the material presented in earlier chapters to discuss the constraints experienced in use of entomopathogens against invasive pests and improvements and new approaches for increasing success with entomopathogens against invasive arthropods in the future.

Naturally Occurring Pathogens and Invasive Arthropods

Abstract Establishment of introduced pest arthropods has been attributed, in part, to the pest arthropods’ separation from natural control agents in their native ranges. Here we focus on the role of endemic pathogens in establishment and population regulation of exotic pest and beneﬁcial arthropods and explore factors affecting their regulation by endemic pathogens. We do not attempt an exhaustive list of examples but illustrate some instances showing diverse aspects of the host-pathogen relationships involved. As a case study, we discuss establishment of the multicolored Asian lady beetle and its rapid spread across North America as related to its resistance to an endemic fungal pathogen to which some native lady beetle species are susceptible. It is clear that advances in our knowledge about the epizootiology of endemic pathogens with exotic arthropods will enhance our understanding of invasion biology and assist in regulation of invasive pests.

2.1 Introduction
The successful establishment of introduced pest arthropods has been attributed, in part, to the pest arthropods’ separation from natural control agents in their native ranges (Williamson 1996, Ehler 1998). This concept, i.e. the ‘enemy release hypothesis’, is commonly referenced in the literature as a mechanism that fosters invasive species (Keane & Crawley 2002, Torchin et al. 2003, Clay 2003, Prenter et al. 2004). For example, in a study of invasive plant species, Mitchell and Power (2003) found that each invasive species was infected by 77% fewer fungal and viral pathogen species in naturalized versus native ranges. Similarly, Torchin et al. (2003) reported that invasive species possess about half the number of parasites as compared with native species. Based on examples such as these, one might extend the argument to pathogen load in invasive arthropods, i.e. one would predict a low prevalence

of disease in invasive arthropods. And indeed this is the case in certain invasive arthropods as we illustrate later in the chapter. However, we would be remiss not to acknowledge that isolates of some endemic pathogens can be quite virulent to exotic insects (Lacey et al. 2001, Koppenho¨fer & Fuzy 2003, Duncan et al. 2003). In this chapter we focus on the role of endemic pathogens in establishment and population regulation of exotic arthropods.
For this discussion the term endemic refers to an organism that naturally occurs in the area and has not been introduced. Estimating the impact of endemic pathogens on introduced arthropods is difﬁcult. One difﬁculty is that it is not always clear whether a pathogen is endemic or whether it may have been introduced along with its host. Certainly some introduced pathogens have become established in particular regions and may have signiﬁcant impact on their host populations (Hajek et al. 2007), e.g. the case of the fungus Entomophaga maimaiga Humber, Shimazu, and Soper and its effect on the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.) (Weseloh & Andreadis 1992, Hajek 1997). Yet for our purposes these established introductions are not considered endemic. In cases where the host-pathogen relationship is highly speciﬁc (e.g. many baculoviruses and microsporidia) it is likely the pathogen was introduced along with its host. Yet even in cases where the pathogen has a broad host range (e.g. many entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes), it may not be clear if the particular strain or species of pathogen was present prior to the arthropod’s introduction. In this chapter, the pathogens we discuss are, to the best of our knowledge, endemic. Here we ﬁrst address, in a general sense, factors that contribute to endemic pathogen impact on invasive arthropods. We then offer a case study, i.e. the establishment and spread of Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) across North America, to serve as a basis for discussion of natural enemy release and the role of entomopathogens in invasion biology.

2.2 Factors Affecting Endemic Entomopathogen Regulation of Introduced Arthropod Populations
This section explores factors that may affect the regulation of exotic arthropods by endemic pathogens. The intent is not to provide an exhaustive list, but rather to use several examples to illustrate some of the diverse aspects of the host-pathogen relationships involved. Various abiotic and biotic factors are known to affect the ability of entomopathogens to cause disease in host populations (Fuxa 1987, Fuxa & Tanada 1987, Lacey & Shapiro-Ilan 2008). Generally, many factors affecting regulation of introduced arthropods by endemic entomopathogens can be expected to be similar to other pathogen-host relationships that include endemic hosts or introduced pathogens. Yet some nuances may be anticipated given that, in the case of interest here, it is the host species that has the challenge of adapting to the new environment whereas the endemic pathogen is already established and has managed to exist and evolve in the native ecosystem. Indeed, it is arguable that environmental barriers inﬂuencing population regulation may not be as pronounced in endemic pathogens as compared with introduced pathogens (due to the former’s inherent establishment in

the environment). Examples of endemic pathogens exhibiting superior persistence and efﬁcacy in controlling introduced arthropod pests include entomopathogenic nematode control of the Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica Newman (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) (Lacey et al. 2001, Koppenho¨fer & Fuzy 2003), and control of a root weevil, Diaprepes abbreviatus (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), by Steinernema diaprepesi Nguyen & Duncan (Duncan et al. 2003).
The impact of endemic pathogens on introduced arthropods can vary. Some examples of endemic pathogens that have caused substantial mortality in introduced insect pests include: 84% of soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), infected with entomopathogenic fungi (Nielsen & Hajek 2005), up to approximately 53% mortality in D. abbreviatus infected by entomopathogenic nematodes (Duncan et al. 2003), and a 79% reduction in a whitefringed beetle population, Graphognathus leucoloma (Boheman) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) associated with the presence of Heterorhabditis sp. (Sexton & Williams 1981). Additionally, the introduced millipede Ommatoiulus moreletii (Lucas) has declined in Australia as a result of natural biological control by the native nematode Rhabditis necromena Sudhaus and Schulte (McKillup et al. 1988, Schulte 1989, Sudhaus & Schulte 1989). In contrast, contributions by endemic entomopathogens can also be minimal; for example, in southern Michigan, entomopathogenic nematode infections in P. japonica were <1% (Cappaert & Smitley 2002), yet substantially higher impact by entomopathogenic nematodes has been observed in the eastern US (Campbell et al. 1998). The reasons for varying impacts of endemic pathogens are unclear. Some factors that have been documented to affect population regulation by endemic pathogens include the environment, host density and host range.
Although endemic pathogens are adapted to their native ecosystem, environmental factors still contribute to epizootics and population regulation. For example, Wraight et al. (1993) observed that prevalence of fungal infection in the Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), was substantially higher in irrigated ﬁelds relative to non-irrigated ﬁelds. Additionally, soil type was found to impact the prevalence and relative distribution of endemic entomopathogenic nematodes in citrus (Duncan et al. 2003).
Host density may also be a factor affecting population regulation in some systems. Generally, increases in host density are expected to increase the chances of an epizootic (Fuxa 1987). Nielsen and Hajek (2005) observed that mycosis induced by endemic fungi was proportional to the population density of the soybean aphid, A. glycines. Contrarily, mycosis was not correlated to host density of D. noxia (Feng et al. 1991).
Perhaps most importantly, the potential for population regulation is likely to be limited by the innate host range of the endemic pathogen in question. However, establishment of pathogenicity in the laboratory does not necessarily predict an endemic pathogen-exotic host relationship as physiological host range is not equivalent to ecological host range (Federici & Maddox 1996, Solter & Maddox 1998). In order for an endemic pathogen to impact an introduced host’s population, the two must be biologically and environmentally compatible in terms of the niche they occupy in the ecosystem.

Based on known host ranges and the biology/ecology of endemic pathogens, we can predict or make some generalizations regarding which groups of endemic pathogens have potential to impact particular arthropods. For example, disease prevalence may be predicted in part by a pathogen’s adaptation to infection in soil versus above ground. Aphid species tend to be susceptible to certain fungi that are capable of effectively causing infection aboveground, e.g. fungi in the order Entomophthorales. Indeed, a number of endemic Entomophthorales, such as Pandora (=Er ynia) neoaphidis (Remaudiere & Hennebert) and Conidiobolus spp., can cause substantial mortality in established populations of exotic D. noxia (Wraight et al. 1993, Feng et al. 1991, Hatting et al. 1999, 2000) and A. glycines (Nielsen & Hajek 2005). In contrast, ground-dwelling larvae of Coleoptera tend to be susceptible to entomopathogenic nematodes and hypocrealean fungi (Ascomycota: Clavicipitaceae) (e.g. Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin and Metarhizium anisopliae (Metchnikoff) Sorokin). Examples of introduced Coleoptera that support this generalization include larvae of D. abbreviatus (Beavers et al. 1983, McCoy et al. 2000, Duncan et al. 2003) and P. japonica (Campbell et al. 1998, Lacey et al. 2001, Koppenho¨fer & Fuzy 2003). One interesting example where an endemic pathogen affects an introduced insect both in the soil and above ground is B. bassiana infection of the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hu¨bner) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). In corn ﬁelds, B. bassiana can infect a substantial proportion of overwintering larvae in the soil (up to 84%), but also infects O. nubilalis larvae within the corn plant, a process that is facilitated by the ability of the endemic fungus to function as an endophyte and colonize corn (Bing & Lewis 1991, 1993).
The ability of endemic pathogens to regulate introduced pests can be complex. Not only can the pathogens be differentially affected by environmental factors and other endemic soil organisms (Fuxa 1987, Koppenho¨fer & Grewal 2005) but endemic pathogens may interact (indirectly) with introduced pathogen populations as well. In some cases introduced pathogens can out-compete endemic pathogen populations, potentially reducing the overall level of arthropod suppression (Duncan et al. 2003). Yet in other cases introduced pathogens may not cause displacement of endemic pathogens since they occupy different niches in the soil (Millar & Barbercheck 2001). Our knowledge and understanding of the complexities affecting population regulation of introduced arthropods by endemic pathogens is severely limited by the paucity of studies addressing the issue. Clearly additional research in this area is required.

2.3 A Case Study: Endemic Pathogens and the Multicolored Asian Lady Beetle
Here we will examine the case of an introduced species of lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) (Fig. 2.1), and the emerging evidence that this species exhibits resistance to some endemic entomopathogens in North America. It is likely that freedom from endemic predators, parasites and possibly pathogens beneﬁted those early populations of H. axyridis that became established.

Pest management through classical biological control has led to the introduction of numerous exotic insect predators and parasites into the U.S. Some of these introduced natural enemy species became established but many did not, even when apparently suited to the target pest species and the new habitat. In order for an introduced species to be considered established, Andow et al. (1997) proposed that more than one generation of that species must have been recovered far from introduction sites. When introduced natural enemy species fail to establish, speciﬁc reasons for failure generally are not known. Sometimes the assumption is made that numbers of released individuals were too low or attempts to establish natural enemies were hampered by weather, insecticide usage, competition with native natural enemies, diseases decreasing the population of the target pest, and the disruptive effects of crop harvest (van den Bosch et al. 1959, Simmonds 1966, DeBach & Rosen 1991). Other ambiguous reasons stated for failure of an introduced species to establish relate to inadequate biological information about the introduced natural enemy, indifference by researchers, lack of persistence by the introduced natural enemy, technical problems and climatic factors (van den Bosch 1968). The possible role of pathogens, speciﬁcally endemic pathogens, is rarely broached in the research literature regarding success or failure of an introduced natural enemy. Thus, examples of endemic pathogens impacting exotic natural enemies by hampering their establishment are lacking.
If we consider the process of intentionally introducing natural enemies through classical biological control, these natural enemies should be free from most of their own natural enemies. Before the release of natural enemies into a new environment, Simmonds (1966) states that the removal of parasites from predators and hyperparasites from parasites is necessary. Additionally, the culturing of insects before release can free them from pathogens that are associated with their native habitats (Simmonds 1966), especially pathogens transmitted horizontally. Accidentally released arthropods that establish may also be free from a percentage of their natural complement of pathogens due to the expected small size of the establishing population and due to complex life cycles of pathogens that may not be compatible with the transport and establishment process.

When data are presented concerning the effect of naturally-occurring pathogens upon beneﬁcial arthropods, i.e. parasitoids and predators, it concerns rates of infection by nematodes or gregarine protozoa (see Ceryngier & Hodek 1996), mortality of overwintering populations when beetles aggregate (Iperti 1966a, b, Ceryngier 2000) or male-killing bacteria (Hurst & Jiggins 2000). But by far, most information regarding the impact of pathogens on beneﬁcial arthropods concerns the non-target impacts of commercially-available, biorational products (e.g. fungi) applied in an insecticidal fashion (Magalhaes et al. 1988, Giroux et al. 1994, James & Lighthart 1994, Todorova et al. 1994, James et al. 1995, Pingel & Lewis 1996, Poprawski et al. 1998, James et al. 1998, Caga´nˇ & Uhl´ık 1999, Todorova et al. 2000, Smith & Krischik 2000, Pell & Vandenberg 2002, Laird et al. 1990, Ludwig & Oetting 2001). Relatively little information exists with regard to how endemic pathogens affect populations of beneﬁcial arthropods (native and exotic), especially with regard to the arthropod’s viability in biological control programs (Vinson 1990). Kuznetsov (1997) reviewed research on pathogens of coccinellids in eastern Russia and found that Coccinella septempunctata L., H. axyridis, Calvia quatuordecimguttata (L.) and Hippodamia tredecimpunctata (L.) were infected by B. bassiana and Beauveria brongniartii (Saccardo) Petch (=B. tenelle). He considered their impact minimal on those predaceous coccinellids. Yinon (1969) found adult Chilocorus bipustulatus (L.) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) infected by the laboulbenialean fungus Hesperomyces virescens and larvae infected by ‘white mycelium’ on trunks in citrus groves but no supporting data were provided to indicate the prevalence of these diseases in ﬁeld populations or the impact of these pathogens on predation by C. bipustulatus.
The introduction of lady beetles into North America for pest control was common following successful control of the exotic cottony-cushion scale, Icerya purchasi (Homoptera: Coccidae), on citrus by Rodolia cardinalis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in California during the late 1880s (Hagen 1974, Gordon 1985, DeBach & Rosen 1991). During this pre-insecticide era, 179 foreign species of Coccinellidae were purposely released into the U.S. As an end result of these intentional introductions, 16 exotic species of Coccinellidae were established in the U.S. (Gordon 1985). Harmonia axyridis was ﬁrst recorded being intentionally introduced into North America as early as 1916 and more releases were made by various federal and state researchers into the 1980s (Gordon 1985). Establishment of H. axyridis via accidental introductions at seaports remains a possibility (Krafsur et al. 1997). Nonetheless, established H. axyridis populations in North America were not detected until 1988 in Louisiana and thereafter H. axyridis quickly spread across much of the United States and southern Canada (Tedders & Schaefer 1994, Coderre et al. 1995, Lamana & Miller 1996, Brown & Miller 1998, Colunga-Garcia & Gage 1998). Although the intent of establishing H. axyridis was for control of plant pests, several negative impacts have developed. The overwhelming successful establishment of this insect negatively affects competing native lady beetles (Cottrell & Yeargan 1998), it can overwinter in buildings including homes where it can be a great nuisance (Nalepa et al. 2000) and it has been implicated as a pest of midwestern wine grapes when adults feed on damaged grapes and are harvested along with the crop, resulting in the wine ﬂavor being tainted (Koch 2003).

It is likely that the initial population of H. axyridis that became established in North America faced many hurdles commonly encountered when attempting to establish any beneﬁcial arthropod in a new habitat, and for those reasons, many of the numerous, early introductions failed to establish. But once a population did establish, inherent traits gave this species a competitive edge over native guild species. Traits that suggest why H. axyridis has apparently out-competed native coccinellid species in some habitats include its polyphagous diet, high fecundity (Michaud 2002), aggressive behavior (Cottrell & Yeargan 1999, Michaud 2002), high mobility (With et al. 2002) and large body size (Cottrell & Yeargan 1999, Michaud 2002). Another factor inﬂuencing population dynamics of native and exotic species may involve attack by parasites. Obrycki (1989) reported on differential susceptibility of certain native and exotic coccinellid species to the cosmopolitan parasitoid Dinocampus coccinellae Schrank (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). Following this trend, Hoogendorn and Heimpel (2002) showed that successful parasitism of H. axyridis by D. coccinellae was lower than parasitism of the native Coleomegilla maculata (DeGeer) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) even though the proportion of each species attacked was similar. However, it is questionable whether a dearth of endemic pathogens adapted to attack this exotic species could have contributed, in part, to its successful establishment and rapid dispersal across much of North America. Recently, we suggested that reduced susceptibility to endemic pathogens facilitated the establishment and quick dispersal of H. axyridis (Cottrell & Shapiro-Ilan 2003, Shapiro-Ilan & Cottrell 2005).
Initial support for our hypothesis was based on differential susceptibility of H. axyridis and the native coccinellid Olla v-nigrum (Mulsant) to B. bassiana. The suspected differences were ﬁrst based on preliminary ﬁeld observations of these two species’ susceptibility to B. bassiana. It was discovered that some adults of the native O. v-nigrum overwintering under pecan bark (Carya illinoinensis) were infected with B. bassiana (Cottrell & Shapiro-Ilan 2003). These infected, dead adults had visible mycosis typical of B. bassiana (Fig. 2.2). Some O. v-nigrum adults collected

alive from under pecan bark and held in the laboratory with aphids and water died and also exhibited mycosis. However, mycosis of H. axyridis had never been observed whether insects came from overwintering aggregations in buildings or from ﬁeld collections in various habitats including pecan orchards. These observations prompted Cottrell and Shapiro-Ilan (2003) to test the pathogenicity of B. bassiana collected from infected O. v-nigrum against the exotic H. axyridis and against the native O. v-nigrum. We discovered that B. bassiana isolated from O. v-nigrum was substantially more virulent to O. v-nigrum than H. axyridis. A concentration of 2.5×105 conidia/ml was found to be the LC50 for O. v-nigrum but this concentration did not cause any mortality in H. axyridis. In fact, even a concentration of 3.9 × 108 conidia/ml was not pathogenic to H. axyridis. The commercially-available GHA strain of B. bassiana was not virulent against either the native O. v-nigrum or the exotic H. axyridis when assayed at the LC50 for O. v-nigrum. This is interesting given the incredibly broad host range of B. bassiana (Goettel et al. 1990). Nonetheless, the results when using B. bassiana isolated from the native O. v-nigrum indicate lower susceptibility of the exotic H. axyridis to an endemic pathogen and support our hypothesis. James & Lighthart (1994) comment that information from the ﬁeld is needed to determine how direct effects seen in the laboratory play out in habitats where multiple species interact. Again, ﬁeld data from Cottrell & Shapiro-Ilan (2003), although geographically limited, was suggestive that isolates of B. bassiana exist that are pathogenic to native coccinellids but not to H. axyridis.
Harmonia axyridis occupies many habitats and overlaps both temporally and spatially with many native species of North American Coccinellidae. If our hypothesis regarding H. axyridis is correct, we should expect that some of these other native competitors will be negatively affected by endemic pathogens. To partially address this issue, Cottrell and Shapiro-Ilan (2008) used an isolate of B. bassiana collected from a naturally-infected O. v-nigrum adult (as used by Cottrell & Shapiro-Ilan 2003) and tested it against four species of Coccinellidae native to North America, i.e. O. v-nigrum, Cycloneda munda (Say), Hippodamia convergens (Gue´rin-Me´neville) and C. maculata. The hypothesis was supported in that C. munda, O. v-nigrum and H. convergens were susceptible but H. axyridis was not susceptible. Further support comes from the fact that another exotic lady beetle established in North America, C. septempunctata, was not susceptible to this same isolate of B. bassiana. Coleomegilla maculata, however, was the only native species tested that was not susceptible. Additionally, only the native species C. munda, O. v-nigrum and H. convergens exhibited visible signs of mycosis when treated with B. bassiana isolated from O. v-nigrum. Results such as these show that speciﬁc isolates could play a key role in the population regulation of native natural enemies while allowing resistant, newly-established natural enemies to gain a competitive edge over native species.
In addition to the observed differential susceptibility to an isolate of B. bassiana, more evidence of H. axyridis being less susceptible to disease than native species is provided by Shapiro-Ilan and Cottrell (2005). In this study, two species of native coccinellids (i.e. C. maculata and O. v-nigrum) and two species of exotic coccinellids (i.e. H. axyridis and C. septempunctata) were assessed for their

relative susceptibility to entomopathogenic nematodes. The nematode strains used, i.e. Steinernema carpocapsae (Cxrd) and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (VS), were both originally isolated in North America. Given the widespread geographic distribution of both the nematode species and the native coccinellids C. maculata and O. v-nigrum, it is likely that natural interaction between these organisms would occur. Although most coccinellid species would be expected to spend more time on plants, coccinellid-nematode interaction is most likely to occur with larval stages that can be found on the soil. Interactions between the nematodes and adults would be limited but possible, especially for C. maculata adults that spend time on lowgrowing plants. Larval coccinellids often fall to the soil from host plants while searching for prey and will even disperse from plants via the soil (Cottrell & Yeargan 1999). Thus, the native species would be expected to have had more contact with these endemic pathogens compared with the exotic coccinellids. Indeed, Shapiro-Ilan and Cottrell (2005) showed that mortality of native coccinellids was generally higher than mortality of exotic coccinellids when treated with S. carpocapsae (Cxrd), whereas H. bacteriophora (VS) had less effect overall on coccinellids with the only difference being higher mortality of the native O. v-nigrum versus H. axyridis. Again, our hypothesis that the establishment of some exotic species may be fostered by their resistance to endemic pathogens is supported.

2.4 Conclusions
The effect of endemic pathogens upon native versus exotic species can play out in different ways. For example, the endemic pathogens could exhibit high virulence to the exotic arthropod, regardless of virulence toward native arthropods, and thus negatively affect establishment of the exotic arthropod, or, the endemic pathogens could exhibit low virulence to the exotic arthropod and high virulence to native competitors thus facilitating establishment of the exotic arthropod. The former could provide a partial explanation why only 16 of the 179 species of coccinellids intentionally introduced into North America have become established (Gordon 1985). Although there is no direct evidence to support this supposition regarding all of those introduced coccinellids, the impact of endemic pathogens on introduced arthropods can be highly signiﬁcant as demonstrated with entomopathogenic fungi against A. glycines (Nielsen & Hajek 2005) and entomopathogenic nematodes infecting D. abbreviatus (Duncan et al. 2003) and G. leucoloma (Sexton & Williams 1981). The latter, i.e. low virulence to the exotic arthropod and high virulence to native competitors, provides an explanation for the success of H. axyridis in North America and favors the enemy release hypothesis. This hypothesis has been used to explain the success of some invading plants and animals but has not (previous to our work) been suggested speciﬁcally as a mechanism fostering establishment of exotic natural enemies such as H. axyridis where lower susceptibility to speciﬁc strains or isolates of endemic pathogens has been demonstrated compared with some native competitors. It is likely that the successful establishment and widespread distribution of another exotic coccinellid, C. septempunctata, across North America

was also fostered by its reduced susceptibility to endemic pathogens. Thus the role of endemic pathogens upon establishment of exotic arthropod species should be examined further. This can be done by examining the natural prevalence of pathogens in native and exotic species where both exist at different geographic locations and comparing their relative competitiveness as correlated with disease prevalence. It should also be determined if differential susceptibility between native and exotic species occurs with more isolates of endemic pathogens. Additionally, the virulence of pathogens from the native range of the exotic species could be tested to further determine the relevance of the enemy release hypothesis in this situation.
An understanding of the physiological and ecological host range of endemic pathogens can have positive impacts on the success of biological control. With respect to potential biological control agents that are being considered for introduction, it would be useful to know their physiological susceptibility to a suite of endemic pathogens known to attack similar native species at the proposed introduction site. Although the physiological susceptibility will likely exceed the ecological susceptibility, knowing which pathogens will not infect the host under optimum conditions is useful and would allow for further reﬁning of ecological susceptibility assays and could aid in decision-making regarding releases. Additionally, little information is available on the prevalence of endemic pathogens naturally infecting beneﬁcial arthropods in the ﬁeld and what impact they may have upon beneﬁcial arthropod populations.
Advances in our knowledge about the epizootiology of endemic pathogens with exotic arthropods will enhance our understanding of invasion biology, and assist in regulation of invasive pests. The threat of exotic arthropod species becoming established may be related to the pathogenicity and virulence of endemic pathogens to those exotic species. Thus, we may be able to predict the outcome of endemic pathogens on potential exotic arthropod threats in order to categorize risk levels relating to the potential for those exotic arthropods to establish and have a positive (e.g. predators and parasitoids) or negative (e.g. pests) ecological, economical or social impact. For example, if we know that certain endemic pathogens tend to control certain orders, families or genera of pests (and speciﬁc virulence can be tested under quarantine) then conceivably the risk level for exotic arthropod species, within that order, family or genera, would be deemed low. With continued globalization, there has been a parallel increase in the number of invasive pests (Perrings et al. 2005); therefore the importance of elucidating the role of endemic pathogens in preventing establishment or controlling exotic pests post-establishment carries an increasingly greater weight.

Chapter 3
Population Ecology of Managing Insect Invasions
Andrew M. Liebhold and Patrick C. Tobin

Abstract Invasions are characterized by three phases: arrival, establishment and spread. In this chapter we focus on the establishment and spread phases with consideration of how population processes operating during each stage inﬂuence the selection of management strategies. Typically, the establishment phase is dominated by the Allee effect in which population growth rates decrease with decreasing abundance. Allee effects can arise from several different mechanisms and are capable of driving low-density populations to extinction. Strategies to eradicate newly established populations should focus on either enhancing Allee effects or suppressing populations below Allee thresholds, such that extinction proceeds without further intervention. Spread of invading populations results from the coupling of population growth with dispersal. The spread of most non-indigenous insects is characterized by “stratiﬁed dispersal” in which occasional long-distance dispersal results in the formation of isolated colonies ahead of the continuously infested range boundary. These colonies grow, coalesce and greatly increase spread rates. Allee effects also affect spread, in part, by contributing to the extinction of colonies formed through stratiﬁed dispersal. One approach to containing the spread of an invading species focuses on eradicating these isolated colonies. Microbial control is one management tactic that is very appropriate for suppressing populations of invasive species below Allee thresholds and consequently preventing their establishment or limiting their rate of spread.

3.1 Introduction
Given ever-increasing trends in world trade and travel, invasions by non-indigenous insect species are likely to continue to increase (Levine & D’Antonio 2003). While efforts continue to close various pathways by which alien forest pests arrive (e.g. quarantines on solid wood packing material), it is unlikely that new arrivals

can be completely stopped. Therefore it is clear that new pest species are likely to continue to arrive and many of these species are likely to have catastrophic ecological and economic consequences (Strong & Pemberton 2000, Pimentel et al. 2000).
Three distinct population processes occur during the course of virtually every invasion: arrival (the process by which individuals are transported from their native to non-native habitat), establishment (the process by which populations grow to sufﬁcient levels such that extinction is no longer feasible), and spread (the expansion of a population’s range) (Dobson & May 1986, Shigesada & Kawasaki 1997, Liebhold & Tobin 2008) (Table 3.1). In this chapter we focus on the population ecology principles that are operating during the establishment and spread phases and implications for management through eradication (i.e. forced extinction of a population) and containment (i.e. quarantine and barrier zones implemented to minimize the spread of the population to new areas). We explore these processes in the context of managing invading populations using microbials. The arrival phase is also an important invasion process but is less relevant to management using microbials; readers may wish to consult other sources about invasion pathways and arrival processes (McCullough et al. 2006, Everett 2000, Jerde & Lewis 2007).

3.2 Establishment

Considerable evidence indicates that arrival of alien species occurs at a much higher rate than the rate of establishment; most introduced species fail to establish (Williamson & Fitter 1996, Simberloff & Gibbons 2004). The establishment phase thus represents a critical period during which populations grow and expand their distribution such that extinction is highly unlikely. Founder populations typically are small and consequently are at great risk of extinction. All populations (both sparse and abundant) are affected by random abiotic inﬂuences (e.g. weather), but low-density populations are particularly inﬂuenced by such effects. Mathematically, change in population density from one time period to the next can be represented as

Nt+1 = f (Nt ) + εt ,

(3.1)

where N is population density in year t or t + 1, f (Nt ) is a function that encompasses birth and death processes, and εt random variation in the environment. In

addition to environmental stochasticity, all populations are affected by demographic stochasticity, which refers to random variation in birth and death processes (Engen et al. 1998). Because sparse populations, by deﬁnition, exist at densities near zero, both demographic and environmental stochasticity can cause these populations to go extinct. In addition, Allee effects can often have a signiﬁcant impact on low-density populations.
Warder Allee (1931) was fascinated by cooperative behavior in animals and is credited as the ﬁrst individual to suggest that cooperation is signiﬁcant at the population level. In particular, Allee noticed that at low densities, survival and reproduction were often limited by the lack of conspeciﬁcs and this could lead to population decline. Certain processes may lead to decreasing net population growth with decreasing density, and thus, there may exist a threshold below which low-density populations are driven toward extinction (Fig. 3.1A). This phenomenon, known as the Allee effect (Courchamp et al. 1999, Dennis 1989), has been critically important in our understanding of extinction in low-density populations of rare species and therefore is highly relevant in conservation efforts (Stephens & Sutherland 1999). However, because of their role in low-density populations, Allee effects have been recognized recently to be important during the establishment phase of biological invasions since founder populations of introduced species are generally at low densities (Drake 2004, Leung et al. 2004, Taylor & Hastings 2005).
The many causes of Allee effects include failure to locate mates (Berec et al. 2001, Hopper & Roush 1993), inbreeding depression (Lande 1998), the failure to satiate predators (Gascoigne & Lipcius 2004), and the lack of cooperative feeding (Clark & Faeth 1997). The term “component Allee effect” refers to the decrease in population growth with decreasing density caused by a single mechanism. The term “demographic Allee effect” refers to decreasing growth with decreasing density at the population level. In many cases, demographic Allee effects arise from several components, although multiple sources of Allee effects do not necessarily act additively and instead may interact in complex ways (Berec et al. 2007).
Because most insects reproduce sexually, failure to locate mates when populations are at low densities can limit population growth and contribute to a demographic Allee effect (Hopper & Roush 1993, Berec et al. 2001, Wells et al. 1998). Even though many insect species have evolved highly efﬁcient mate-location systems (e.g. sex pheromones), males and females may be simply too far apart in space to ﬁnd each other and mate, which may ultimately prevent a low-density population of invaders from establishing. Mate-ﬁnding can also be inﬂuenced by seasonal asynchrony of adult male and female sexual maturation, and species with pronounced protandry (i.e. male emergence precedes that of females) and variation in developmental times are likely to exhibit stronger Allee effects (Robinet et al. 2007, Calabrese & Fagan 2004).
Many herbivorous insect species also utilize cooperative feeding behaviors, in which an aggregation of individuals increases the ability of populations to overcome host defenses and successfully establish themselves, as is the case in tree-killing bark beetles (Raffa & Berryman 1983). Larval aggregations, especially neonates or younger larvae for several species, are better able to exploit food resources protected

When density is less than C, the Allee threshold (black circle), it will decrease toward extinction. When density exceeds C it will increase toward K , the carrying capacity. When populations exceed the carrying capacity, they will decrease. B. Illustration of eradication strategies. The ﬁrst strategy is to reduce the population density (solid star) to a new density (open star) that is below the Allee threshold. In the second strategy, the Allee threshold is increased to a new level (open circle) that exceeds the population density. Both strategies result in population extinction
by the host (either chemically or physically) because large groups are more efﬁcient at initializing successful feeding sites (Ghent 1960, Clark & Faeth 1997). Thus, Allee effects may occur when founder populations arrive in numbers insufﬁcient to capitalize on cooperative feeding advantages, e.g. if numbers of bark beetles are insufﬁcient to overcome host tree defenses. Similarly, Allee effects may arise at low densities because the presence of conspeciﬁcs may promote population growth via saturation of predators. In general, predation can be expected to contribute a component Allee effect in any low-density invading population (Gascoigne & Lipcius 2004).

3.3 Spread

Spread of a non-indigenous species is a process by which a species expands its range from a habitat that it currently occupies to one that it does not. In its simplest form, spread is continuous and simply results from the coupling of dispersal with population growth. This was ﬁrst described in the ecological literature by Skellam (1951), whose model speciﬁcally combined exponential population growth with diffusive (random) movement (Fig. 3.2A). The magnitude of dispersal is characterized by the diffusion coefﬁcient, D, which can be estimated as the standard deviation of dispersal distances, typically compiled from mark-recapture experiments (Kareiva 1983). In Skellam’s model, population growth was characterized by r , which is the intrinsic rate of population increase under ideal conditions. Skellam (1951) applied his model to show that the radial rate of range expansion, V , is asymptotically constant and can be estimated according to

√

V = 2 r D.

(3.2)

Although there are several examples in which Eq. 3.2 has provided spread estimates that were similar to observed rates of spread (Shigesada & Kawasaki 1997, Andow et al. 1990), there are many cases where it fails (Shigesada & Kawasaki 1997). This failure can be attributed to the simplicity of Skellam’s biological assumptions, and in particular, the failure to account for long-distance dispersal.
Insect spread may not always be represented by simple diffusion; instead, longrange movement of insects, such as through anthropogenic or other mechanisms, may occur with considerable frequency. Such leptokurtic or “fat-tailed” dispersaldistance distributions can lead to much faster rates of spread than those predicted by simple diffusion models (Clark 1998, Kot et al. 1996). Moreover, long-distance dispersal events are more often than not caused by a completely different mecha-

The solid innermost circle represents the initial range at time 0: A shows spread according to Skellam’s (1951) model of successive time steps; B illustrates spread predicted using a stratiﬁed dispersal model (Hengeveld 1989, Shigesada et al. 1995, Shigesada & Kawasaki 1997)

nism, such as through the movement of goods by humans or through atmospheric transport mechanisms, than short-distance movement events, such as those that occur through active insect ﬂight. The combined processes of short-range and long-range dispersal is referred to as “stratiﬁed dispersal,” and is a major driver of spread dynamics (Shigesada & Kawasaki 1997, Shigesada et al. 1995, Hengeveld 1989). The occurrence of long-distance dispersal, even at a relatively low rate, has been shown to cause much greater rates of spread than would occur with only short-range dispersal (Shigesada et al. 1995). This is because long-range dispersal causes populations to “jump” well ahead of the continuously infested boundary of the expanding species range. These jumps result in isolated populations that grow (via population growth coupled with short-range dispersal) and ultimately coalesce. This phenomenon is well illustrated by the spread of the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) in North America: short-distance dispersal of airborne 1st instars on silken threads carries many individuals relatively short distances but humans sometimes accidentally transport life stages long distances, well ahead of the advancing population front (Liebhold et al. 1992, Whitmire & Tobin 2006). Spread is thus enhanced by the growth of isolated colonies ahead of the expanding population front and their eventual coalescence with the population front. It is the rate of formation and growth of these colonies that ultimately determines the rate of gypsy moth spread (Sharov & Liebhold 1998).
Low-density, isolated colonies founded ahead of the expanding population, through long-distance dispersal mechanisms, are typically inﬂuenced by Allee effects analogous to newly arrived populations that are in the early stages of establishment (see Section 3.2). Theoretical studies have shown that Allee dynamics can negatively affect the growth and persistence of isolated colonies, driving a large proportion to extinction, thereby reducing spread (Taylor et al. 2004, Hui & Li 2004). Johnson et al. (2006) noted a curious phenomenon of periodically-pulsed spread every 3–4 years in historical records of gypsy moth range expansion, and contended that this behavior was caused by an interaction between stratiﬁed dispersal and Allee effects. Speciﬁcally, they observed that most isolated colonies founded from long-distance dispersal went extinct because of Allee effects unless populations at the advancing population front were at sufﬁcient levels such that they could found isolated populations that exceeded the Allee threshold. At this point, spread would pulse forward but then stop again until populations once again grew to sufﬁcient levels. For more details of how Allee effects inﬂuence spread, the reader should consult Taylor and Hastings (2005).

3.4 Management of Establishment
The failure of invading populations to establish following arrival results in extinction and this should be the goal of any effort to prevent establishment. We deﬁne eradication as the total elimination of a species from a geographical area (Simberloff 2003, Knipling 1979). Despite the importance of eradication in the management of biological invasions, the entire concept has been controversial for many years (Myers

3 Population Ecology of Managing Insect Invasions

39

et al. 1998, 2000, Simberloff 2003, DeBach 1964). One source of this controversy is a belief held by many that it is either impossible or impractical to eliminate every individual in a population (Dahlsten et al. 1989). Another problem that is often raised is that eradication is impossible if there is a steady ﬂow of new invaders ready to recolonize an area where this species was previously eradicated (Myers et al. 2000, Carey 1991). But perhaps the greatest reason for skepticism is the occurrence of several failed eradication programs, such as efforts to eliminate the imported ﬁre ant, Solenopsis invicta (Perkins 1989), and the gypsy moth (Forbush & Fernald 1896, Spear 2005) from the United States. However, there are also many examples of highly successful eradication efforts (Simberloff 2003, 2001, Myers et al. 1998). Thus, it critical to clarify when and where eradication is practical and how it might be most efﬁciently accomplished. The basic population processes associated with the establishment process are critical to these questions.
A frequent criticism of eradication as a strategy is the impracticality of killing every individual in a population. The critical basis for this argument is that eradication can only occur by eliminating all individuals within the population (Dahlsten et al. 1989, Knipling 1979). But our current knowledge of the population biology of sparse, invading populations indicates that most insect species exhibit both stochastic dynamics and Allee effects at low densities, and these processes are likely to drive extremely small populations toward extinction without intervention. Thus, the success of eradication does not depend on achieving 100% reduction of a population but rather on reducing a population below some threshold, below which they will proceed toward extinction without further effort (Fig. 3.2B). This concept was illustrated by Liebhold and Bascompte (2003) using a simple model of stochastic population growth coupled with Allee dynamics. They applied this model to invading gypsy moth populations as a case study to parameterize their model and explored the relationship between population size and the “killing power” (i.e. percent mortality) necessary to achieve eradication. Their model indicated that if invading populations were reduced below a threshold, then most populations went extinct without further intervention. These results explain the consistent success that has been achieved in eradicating sparse gypsy moth populations using only one or two aerial applications of Bacillus thuringiensis, a treatment that is considered to achieve only 95% mortality in a best-case scenario (Miller 1990, Liebhold & McManus 1999).
Successful eradication can thus be an attainable goal if the application of any treatment (e.g. a microbial pesticide) kills a sufﬁcient proportion of a population such that the residual population falls below the Allee threshold and extinction proceeds. In addition to the approach of suppressing populations below the Allee threshold, an alternative strategy is increasing the Allee threshold (via manipulation of population processes) to a point that it exceeds the current population level and therefore the population decreases toward extinction (Fig. 3.2B). Some examples of this approach are provided by various tactics designed to increase the strength of Allee effects, such as interfering with mating. This can be accomplished via mating disruption (Yamanaka 2007), mass-trapping (El-Sayed et al. 2006) and the release of sterile insects (Klassen 2005). There are many examples of how these methods have been utilized in successful eradication programs even though no individuals

40

A.M. Liebhold, P.C. Tobin

were actually killed (El-Sayed et al. 2006, Klassen 2005). In addition to altering mating success, there are probably several other approaches that could be used to manipulate the Allee threshold and thereby achieve eradication. Technically, any agent that increases mortality or reduces reproductive output can be expected to reduce population growth (i.e. decrease along the y-axis in Fig. 3.1B) and potentially, these agents could reduce the population size below the Allee threshold (C in Fig. 3.1A, deﬁned here as the density below which population growth is <1) and consequently drive the population to extinction. Augmentation of microbial organisms that increase host mortality (e.g. Beauveria bassiana) or reduce reproductive output (e.g. microsporidia) are approaches that have not received attention as eradication approaches but warrant further consideration.
The concept of eradication also is criticized because in some areas where a species is removed, re-invasion by the same species is likely to occur, thus negating the eradication effort (Myers et al. 1998). This issue is particularly important in areas where the propagule pressure is high (e.g. ports of entry), which obviously makes the task of eradication more difﬁcult (Drake & Lodge 2005). But Simberloff (2003) argued that even though re-invasion detracts from the value of eradication, it does not necessarily make it a futile endeavor. Alternatively, the economic and social beneﬁts of eradication can be addressed in cost-beneﬁt analyses that account for the probability of re-invasion. There are several examples of insect species (e.g. the gypsy moth in the western United States, Mediterranean fruit ﬂy, Ceratitis capitata in California) that are repeatedly eradicated from areas following re-invasion, but the beneﬁts of eradication in these cases vastly outweigh the cost of establishment (Simberloff 2003). Rates of reinvasion may be particularly high or low in certain areas; geographically isolated areas, such as islands, typically have lower rates of re-invasion, making eradication particularly economically feasible, especially when weighed against the typically large impacts of invasive species establishment on island biodiversity.
Another important factor in determining eradication pragmatism is the availability of sensitive survey methods. Some type of survey method is necessary, both to delimit the spatial extent of the nascent population (and target suppression) as well as to evaluate the success of the effort. Chemical attractants are used by many insect species and these are often used in inexpensive yet highly effective traps for detecting their presence. Attractants may not be available for some species and surveys would have to rely upon more expensive techniques (e.g. visual examination) to detect and delimit a population. In one such example, pheromone-baited traps were not available during eradication efforts in New Zealand against the painted apple moth (Teia anartoides); nevertheless, eradication was successfully achieved (at great expense) using traps baited with live females (produced in a rearing facility) as the primary survey tool (Kean & Suckling 2005) (see Chapter 4). When sensitive survey tools are not available for pest species of potentially high economic importance, it may be beneﬁcial to regularly apply control measures in areas of known high propagule pressure, even in the absence of survey data indicating the presence of a population. For example, sterile male releases are made regularly as prophylactic treatments against establishment of invasive fruit ﬂies in selected urban locations in

41

the USA, Australia and Japan (Hendrichs et al. 2002). Methods using prophylactic applications of microbials could also be used in a similar way, though we are not aware of any systems where this has been implemented.

3.5 Management of Spread
Various approaches may be available for slowing, stopping or reversing the spread of an invading species. Reversal or stopping spread can be expected to require greater resources than slowing spread so the latter may be the most realistic objective in many cases. Because there is considerable variation among species in critical parameters, such as dispersal, growth rates and Allee effects, optimal spread management strategies are likely to vary considerably among species.
Because the occurrence of spread is the result of coupling dispersal with population growth, its management should logically focus on reducing dispersal, growth, or some combination of both. As mentioned earlier, long-distance dispersal events, though proportionally less common, can have a large inﬂuence on spread. As a result, expending a little effort to minimize long-distance dispersal may greatly reduce spread. Long-distance dispersal is frequently caused by humans moving goods on which invaders hitchhike, so domestic quarantines and similar approaches that minimize the risks associated with anthropogenic movement may be useful in reducing spread rates. In some systems, there may be other approaches available for reducing spread by mitigating long-distance dispersal. For example, Krushelnycky et al. (2004) found that budding dispersal of Argentine ant colonies at the expanding population front could be stopped through pesticide applications and in some cases, this tactic has completely eliminated spread into adjoining uninfested areas.
Another approach to limiting dispersal is reducing population growth. There are two distinct strategies for limiting population growth that may be used to reduce spread: (1) suppression of populations at or behind the advancing population front that serve as source populations from which propagules originate and invade new areas through long-distance dispersal and (2) suppression of isolated colonies that are formed through long-distance dispersal. In some cases, the former strategy may not be practical because of the sheer magnitude of the area that must be suppressed. An exception to this is the effort in the United States to reverse the spread of the boll weevil (Anthonomus grandis), in which populations have been suppressed over large areas to systematically reduce the boll weevil range (Hardee & Harris 2003). In the second strategy, spread may be reduced by suppressing the growth of outlying colonies. Sharov and Liebhold (1998) proposed a generalized model for slowing the spread of an invading species by eradicating isolated colonies (formed through longdistance dispersal) located ahead of the expanding population front. One beneﬁt of this strategy is that the treatment of relatively small areas (isolated colonies) has a large, negative impact on spread. A good example of this strategy is provided by the gypsy moth in the USA where isolated populations are located (using grids of pheromone-baited traps in an approximately 100-km wide band along the advancing gypsy moth front) and then suppressed. Roughly $8–10 million is spent on the

42

A.M. Liebhold, P.C. Tobin

program annually and gypsy moth spread has been reduced by over 60% (Tobin et al. 2004, Sharov et al. 2002, Tobin & Blackburn 2007).
Again, an important prerequisite to the success of spread management efforts is the availability of practical methods for detecting low-density populations. Sensitive survey methods are particularly crucial for strategies that focus on ﬁnding and eradicating isolated populations formed through long-distance dispersal because densities of such populations are often low. The success of both the current gypsy moth and boll weevil containment efforts may be largely due to the availability of pheromone-baited traps, that are inexpensive yet highly sensitive for detecting low-density populations (Tobin & Blackburn 2007, Hardee & Harris 2003). Containment may not be practical for other insect species where such survey methods are not available.
Another prerequisite for successful management of spread is the availability of control tactics that are effective at low densities. Preferably, such control tactics should have minimal adverse non-target and environmental impacts so that they may be applied in all potential habitats. The ultimate effectiveness of any eradication or barrier zone approach may be compromised by allowing some populations to go untreated. Another crucial consideration, once again, is the Allee effect; isolated populations forming from long-distance dispersal along the expanding population front may be eradicated by manipulating Allee thresholds (e.g. reducing population growth or reproductive output) and this would greatly reduce spread (Tobin et al. 2007). As we suggested earlier for eradication, augmentation of microbial organisms that reduce population growth, either through elevated mortality or reduced reproductive output, merit some consideration as alternative approaches to managing isolated populations that contribute to spread.

3.6 Conclusions
Several past investigations and reviews have focused on the population ecology of biological invasions, providing many examples of how mathematical ecology can make useful predictions that have substantial applied value (Shigesada & Kawasaki 1997, Sakai et al. 2001, Puth & Post 2005, Lockwood et al. 2007). Unfortunately, there still is a disconnect between the current state of knowledge of invasion population ecology and the management of invasions. Successful management of invasions depends on more than just developing new treatment methods (e.g. new strains of microbial pesticides) because it is also crucial to understand when and where to apply treatments. In the future, more work is needed to bridge this gap between population theory and management by utilizing ecological concepts in the formulation of invasion management strategies. In particular, Allee dynamics present a potential “weak link” during the establishment phase that can be greatly exploited to achieve successful eradication. Similarly, the fact that many exotic species spread through stratiﬁed dispersal provides excellent opportunities for limiting the spread of these organisms through management programs, including those that likewise manipulate Allee dynamics as a means to reduce spread.

3 Population Ecology of Managing Insect Invasions

As the ﬁeld of invasion biology continues to grow, it is likely there will be important new advances in understanding the population ecology of invading species. Advances are also likely to be made in the development and optimization of microbial pesticides, which hold great potential not only for suppressing invading pest insect populations, but also minimizing undesirable environmental effects. However, for these advances to translate into progress in minimizing the current explosion of damaging non-indigenous pests, it will be necessary for pest management specialists to work with insect population ecologists to identify, develop and implement effective, science-based strategies that utilize our understanding of population processes operating during biological invasions.

Use of Pathogens for Eradication of Exotic Lepidopteran Pests in New Zealand
Travis R. Glare
Abstract New Zealand has a history of invasive pests causing signiﬁcant damage both economically and environmentally. As an island nation with an agriculturallybased economy, preventing invasion by arthropods and other pests has a high priority. Discovery of three lymantriid moth species in the North Island of New Zealand resulted in eradication programmes, based on the use of the Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki-based product, Foray 48B. New Zealand has no lymantriids and early evaluations of risk determined that each introduced species had the potential to cause economic loss and environmental damage. Populations of two of these pests, Orgyia thyellina (white spotted tussock moth) and Teia anartoides (painted apple moth), were ﬁrst found in Auckland in 1996 and 1999, respectively, while a single Lymantria sp. male was trapped in Hamilton, 70 km to the south of Auckland, in 2003. This single male was originally identiﬁed as the Asian strain of L. dispar and a tentative morphological identiﬁcation suggested it conformed to L. dispar praetera, a subspecies subsequently synonomised with L. umbrosa. However, molecular comparisons need to be completed to conﬁrm speciﬁc identity and most publications in New Zealand still refer to the Asian gypsy moth in Hamilton. L. dispar had been frequently found on cargo and ships in New Zealand ports prior to the single male trap catch. Extensive spraying, both aerial and ground-based, led to the eradication of O. thyellina and T. anartoides from Auckland. The single gypsy moth ﬁnd in Hamilton led to a limited aerial spraying of Foray 48B. No populations of gypsy moth were ever found. The successful eradication of the three lymantriid populations from New Zealand demonstrates that with sufﬁcient treatment, eradication using a microbial-based insecticide is possible, even in urban environments.

4.1 Introduction

T.R. Glare

New Zealand is an island nation in the South Paciﬁc. It has a land area of approximately 268, 680 km2, which primarily consists of two islands, known unimaginatively as North Island and South Island. Having separated from Gondwanaland millions of years ago, many indigenous and novel species have evolved. Since European colonization around 200 years ago, agriculture has become the mainstay of the country, with animal production (meat, wool and dairy) the largest export earner. This combination of indigenous and valued fauna and ﬂora (tourism remains an important earner of export dollars) and a large agricultural sector mean the country is at risk from introductions of pests and diseases. Hence, biosecurity is considered particularly important and is a focus for government, industry and science. There are many very obvious examples of noxious introductions of vertebrates and invertebrates in the past two hundred years (e.g. Australian possums, European wasps, rats, rabbits and stoats), which serve to remind the country of the importance of excluding new pests.
Being an island nation, exclusion of new exotic organisms is potentially easier than in countries that share land borders with other countries. However, despite rigorous quarantine procedures, some pests arrive and, in some cases, have become established. Recent examples include the clover root weevil (Sitona lepidus) and Varroa bee mite. These two examples were discovered when populations were well established and it was decided that eradication would not be possible. However, New Zealand authorities have been successful in eradicating several exotic introductions of tussock moths (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae), which is quite remarkable, given that in each case the population was discovered in a city of some size. Of the three invasive moth species found in New Zealand in recent years, two (Orgyia thyellina and Teia anartoides) were in Auckland, the largest city and main entry point for visitors and goods, and one (Lymantria sp., possibly umbrosa; see below) was in Hamilton (about 70 km south of Auckland).
White spotted tussock moth (O. thyellina; WSTM), a species known in North Asia, and painted apple moth (T. anartoides; PAM), from Australia, are sometimes pests in their home ranges but little literature exists on their control or natural enemies. WSTM was discovered in New Zealand in 1996 and PAM was ﬁrst discovered in 1999. Egg masses and other life stages of the third species, the Asian gypsy moth (L. sp., possibly umbrosa; AGM), had been found on ships in New Zealand ports and on imported automobiles and other cargo for a number of years (Cowley et al. 1993). However, the ﬁnding of a single male AGM (although there is now some doubt about the exact species designation – see Section 4.4.1.) in Hamilton in 2003 was of more concern because this suggested the existence of a reproducing population on land. These were not the only discoveries of new invertebrates in New Zealand during this period but, given the perceived threat to the country’s economy from any forest defoliator, and the potential for successful eradication due to the nature of the insect (in two cases restricted ability to spread due to ﬂightless females) and localised infestations at the time of discovery, eradication campaigns were conducted. Herein, the three programmes are brieﬂy reviewed.

New Zealand has a long history of use of biological control, especially the introduction of exotic insects (often parasites) for control of exotic pests (e.g. Cameron et al. 1989). There have also been many importations of insect pathogens, with the ﬁrst records of the importation of the fungus Beauveria brongniartii from France dating back to the 1890s (Anonymous 1893). Given this history of biological options for pest control, a public view of New Zealand as “clean and green” and a government focused on sustainable agricultural solutions, it was not surprising that the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (Btk) was chosen as the agent for use in eradication programmes. Btk has a long history of environmental and mammalian safety when used for insect control around the world (Glare & O’Callaghan 2000). The fact that the caterpillars of all three species were susceptible to Btk was probably the most compelling factor in even attempting eradication.

4.2 White Spotted Tussock Moth
4.2.1 Detection
Orgyia thyellina (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) was found to be established in Auckland’s eastern suburbs on the 17 April 1996 (Hosking et al. 2003). WSTM is a native of eastern Asia (Japan, Korea and Taiwan), where it is occasionally a pest. However, it had potential to become a pest of plantation forestry, horticulture and native forests in New Zealand, and its discovery raised serious concern. This was exacerbated by awareness of another Lymantriidae, the Asian gypsy moth, which had been the subject of much public and government discussion due to incursions elsewhere in the world. New Zealand has no indigenous Lymantriidae.
There is little published literature on the WSTM eradication effort, but the programme was reviewed by some members of the eradication team (Hosking et al. 2003) and recently by the New Zealand Ombudsman (2007) in a report investigating public complaints of the spray programmes against exotic Lepidoptera. Much of the detail below is derived from these two publications.
In its home range, O. thyellina hosts include oak, elm, willow, larch, apple, cherry, pear, plum, chestnut, walnut and mulberry. It has three generations a year, the third generation females being ﬂightless and laying diapausing eggs. Because the NZ infestation was detected in April as the ﬁnal generation was emerging, there was time to develop strategies and consider response while the pest was overwintering (May–October). Diapausing eggs were not expected to hatch until spring (October– November). During the winter, researchers and the government debated options for control and/or eradication and held discussions with the public and health agencies (Hosking et al. 2003).
4.2.2 Response
The discovery of O. thyellina led the Ministry for Forestry (now incorporated into the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry) to form an Initial Response Group

consisting of representatives from science, government and the forestry sector to recommend a course of action. Government and scientiﬁc impact assessments determined that this species could be a serious problem in forestry and horticulture industries in New Zealand, if allowed to spread. After consideration, the Ministry recommended to the government that eradication be attempted using Btk, and the programme was named Operation Evergreen.
One problem inherent in assessing the severity of the threat posed by infestations of exotic insects is the lack of experts within the country on new invasive species. In the case of WSTM, the Ministry and scientists involved in the programme quickly established international links with experts in lymantriids around the world. These links were crucial in decision making, as the risk to New Zealand was difﬁcult to determine due to the paucity of data in the literature (Hosking et al. 2003). The identiﬁcation of the insect as O. thyellina was conﬁrmed by Dr. Paul Schaefer of the USDA (Hosking et al. 2003).
Visual delimitation surveys, to establish the size of the population and its distribution, were undertaken early in the programme. Survey results established that the infestation covered an area of approximately 7 km2. Early surveys were conducted by a search of easily accessible parks and reserves, as well as suburban gardens, with intensive searches at the outer areas of the infestation. According to Hosking et al. (2003), O. thyellina was thought to be mainly established in a 3 km2 core zone in the suburbs of Auckland. Later surveys used caged live females to trap male moths. At this time, a pheromone development programme was conducted, which eventually led to the discovery and use of a synthetic pheromone in monitoring (see below).
The decision to eradicate was assisted by the low natural dispersal rate of the insect. The ﬁnal generation females are ﬂightless, which restricted spread. The major risk immediately after discovery of the pest was spread by human activities. As the infestation was in an urban environment, movements of gardening rubbish out of the area had a high likelihood of moving eggs. Therefore, a zone around the infestation was established, restrictions on moving green waste were imposed and a disposal site was established within this zone. In addition, O. thyellina lays eggs on inanimate objects, so ﬁeld staff inspected household goods (e.g. furniture) that had been moved from the infested areas and carried out pre-movement inspections (Hosking et al. 2003). Of course, the risk of undetected movements still existed and was recognised.
After considering the costs and beneﬁts of responses and risk of O. thyellina to New Zealand, the Initial Response group recommended attempting eradication to the Government, an approach that was formally accepted by the government on the 22 July 1996 (Hosking et al. 2003).

4.2.2.1 Eradication Programme
A project management team was established to oversee the eradication programme, Operation Evergreen, which included the operational aspects of eradication, research and public relations needs. Separately, the government set up a Science Panel

53

to provide independent advice and a Community Advisory Group to represent community concerns.
The eradication strategy was based on the heavy use of Foray 48B (Nufarm, NZ), which contains Btk as the active agent. Btk has a long track record of use against other members of the Lymantriidae, including aerial use against gypsy moth, L. dispar, in the Northern Hemisphere (Reardon et al. 1994, Chapters 5 and 11). Btk is considered speciﬁc to Lepidoptera in the ﬁeld, although toxicity to a few other insects has been found in the laboratory (Glare & O’Callaghan 2000). The aerial application against AGM invasions in the city of Vancouver was well publicized (Chapter 5; Ministry of Forests and Range 2007), which made Btk an obvious choice for urban spraying for WSTM. Btk was also available in the large quantities required for an eradication campaign; over 150,000 L were used in 6 months. In fact, without a non-chemical agent such as Btk with a long history of safe use, it is difﬁcult to see how the eradication could have been attempted. Btk was already registered in New Zealand for use as ground spray on some food crops, but obviously not for control of WSTM.
Efﬁcacy of Btk against O. thyellina was determined in New Zealand, early in the programme. The team also established that susceptibility dropped off after the 3rd instar, with exposure to a 5 L/ha equivalent of Foray 48B. This ﬁnding established that spray periods should not exceed 10 days between sprays in order to cover larvae from egg hatch to 3rd instar twice (Hosking et al. 2003). However, subsequent research indicated that persistence of Btk on foliage in the spray zone was longer than anticipated, which indicted that the retreatment period of less than 10 days was quite conservative (Hosking et al. 2003).
During Operation Evergreen, an area of up to 4,000 ha was treated in the eastern suburbs of Auckland. Over 30,000 households and an estimated 86,000 people were within the treatment zone (Ombudsman 2007). In total, 158,000 L of Foray 48B were used, in both aerial and ground sprays. A four engine DC6 was used for most of the aerial application, which was the mainstay of the eradication programme. The plane applied nine sprays, ﬂying at a height of 60 m at a speed of approximately 200 knots, with a swath width of 120 m (Hosking et al. 2003). Btk was applied at an undiluted rate of 5 L of Foray 48B/ha (60 BIU/ha), and aiming for a droplet size of 50 microns. Spray applications were carried out at approximately weekly intervals between October and December 1996, although the schedule was weather dependent. In addition to the DC6, a Hughes 500C aircraft and a BK 117 helicopter were used, mainly to treat non-residential gullies, cliffs and bush area. The helicopter was also used to treat a 300 ha area that still had a heavy infestation of WSTM at the end of the programme. A total of 23 applications were made by the second aircraft and helicopter (Ombudsman 2007) at the same application rate. Application by helicopter continued until April 1997 (Hosking et al. 2003).
Over 500 properties with identiﬁed infestations of WSTM were also treated from the ground using mistblowers, at rates of a 1:9 dilution or undiluted Foray 48B. These treatments were carried out between October 1996 and April 1997, within the area that had been sprayed from the air (Hosking et al. 2003).

54
4.2.3 Monitoring

T.R. Glare

Monitoring of the WSTM population was essential to measure efﬁcacy of the treatments. Colonies of WSTM were maintained in the laboratory at Rotorua (Forest Research Institute, now known as Scion), to supply larvae for bioassays and females for use in attraction traps. Live females were used extensively for most of the programme as no pheromone was available. An array of 350 traps, each containing a single live female, was maintained to monitor the population. The females were renewed every 3–5 days. In this programme and the PAM eradication programme (described in Section 4.3.), rearing of colonies was a major undertaking and was crucial to the success of the programme.
Monitoring of the spray deposition after aerial application was also conducted. Potted roses and pine seedlings were placed in the spray zone in various situations (shaded, open, etc.), then removed to quarantine facilities and seeded with 1st – 3rd instar larvae. Spray depositions were modelled using computer software and checked in the ﬁeld (Hosking et al. 2003). Deposition data were collected after each spray run. Persistence of Btk was also monitored from environmental samples for 2 years after the spray programme (Gribben et al. 2002). There was only a slight reduction in numbers of Btk spores in the environment over the 2 years.
There was a formal requirement from the Government that the health of those exposed to the spray be monitored. Self reporting, reports from medical practitioners in the area, and a review of collected health data including birth outcomes, were all included. These results have been reviewed elsewhere (e.g. Aeraqua Medical Services 2001, Hosking et al. 2003, Ombudsman 2007). In brief, the formal monitoring indicated no signiﬁcant outcomes attributable to the spraying (Aeraqua Medical Services 2001), but the Ombudsman’s report on investigations into health impacts was less conclusive, quoting health studies ﬁnding that 375 people (out of 80,000 thought to be exposed to sprays) reported some medical symptoms including respiratory complaints (Ombudsman 2007). The Health Surveillance following Operation Evergreen (Aeraqua Medical Services 2001) did not ﬁnd “adverse patterns” in a data comparison between medical practises inside and outside the spray zone. The extensive use of Btk-based products against gypsy moth in the Northern Hemisphere was often cited regarding the safety of these sprays.

4.2.4 Regulatory Issues
As has been mentioned above, there were a number of regulatory issues to be considered before and during the WSTM eradication programme. At the time, regulations were inadequate to cover the rapid response requirements of an eradication campaign (see Chapter 18). Use of Btk for eradication was covered by the Pesticide Act of 1979. The regulatory body under that Act, the Pesticide Board, granted an “experimental use permit (Limited sale)” for the WSTM eradication programme, a provision that was really designed for efﬁcacy trials with new pesticides prior to full sales. As pointed out by the Ombudsman (2007), the application of 85,000 L under

4 Use of Pathogens for Eradication of Exotic Lepidopteran Pests in New Zealand

55

a limited sales permit, and several extensions to that permit, was probably not the original intention of the Act. Laws in New Zealand were changed as a result of the WSTM infestation; new laws to speciﬁcally cover biosecurity breaches were passed in 1997 (the BioSecurity Act 1996).
Other regulatory issues of note were the limiting of movement of vegetation and other risk items out of the infestation area and the operation of aircraft over urban areas. This latter issue involved the Civil Aviation Authority and also dictated the choice of aircraft. Single engine planes would no longer be allowed to ﬂy low over urban and residential areas. Access to private land was also an issue for ground survey and spray teams (Hosking et al. 2003).

4.2.5 Other Research
A number of research efforts accompanied the discovery and eradication of WSTM, including feeding studies on the insect, susceptibility to other pathogens and development of a synthetic pheromone. Some were directly applicable to Operation Evergreen, while others were unrelated and were aimed at control measures if eradication failed.
At the commencement of the eradication programme, it was unclear from the literature which plants in New Zealand could act as hosts for WSTM. Larvae were thought to have a preference for Rosaceae. However, feeding trials in New Zealand have shown that the caterpillar will eat the native red beech (Nothofagus fusca), garden roses, fruit trees and many other hardwood trees, and larvae can also complete development on Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus nitens (M Kay & W Faulds personal communication). According to Hosking et al. (2003), over 40 species of plants could act as hosts, especially including species in the families Aceraceae, Fagaceae, Salicaceae, Betulaceae, Rosaceae and Fabaceae.
Trials were also conducted to test the susceptibility of WSTM to nucleopolyhedroviruses from prominent tussock moth pests in North America: Orgyia pseudotsugata and Orgyia leucostigma, as no pathogens were available from O. thyellina (Walsh et al. 1999). The O. pseudotsugata nucleopolyhedrovirus OpMNPV (“VirtussTM ”) and the O. leucostigma nucleopolyhedrovirus OrleSNPV were imported from Canada and tested for virulence against O. thyellina. Complete mortality by 15 days was achieved at doses of ≥ 105 polyhedral inclusion bodies/cm2 of artiﬁcial diet against 1–2nd instar larvae for both viruses (Walsh et al. 1999); however the viruses were never used. The rearing of WSTM for the programme also uncovered another pathogen, almost disastrously, as it caused a crash in the rearing colonies. This was a cypovirus (cytoplasmic polyhedrovirus), likely introduced through ﬁeld-collected foliage. It is likely to be the same virus that affected the painted apple moth colony reared years later and was characterised by Vernon Ward (Markwick et al. 2005).
At the outset, the isolation of a pheromone was considered important to the success of the programme, although in the absence of a pheromone using live females became the mainstay of the monitoring and trapping efforts for the majority

of the operation. Gries et al. (1999) were successful in determining the two compounds, (Z)-6-heneicosen-11-one (Z6-11-one) and (Z)-6-heneicosen-9-one, which, when combined in a 100:5 ratio, attracted male WSTM. Field tests were conducted in the ﬁeld in Japan and in cages in New Zealand. Over the summer of 1997–1998, 45,000 commercially produced lures containing these compounds were used to monitor for remaining WSTM, although it is not reported if any WSTM were caught (Gries et al. 1999).

4.2.6 Public and Government Response
As stated by Hosking et al. (2003) “The ability to undertake the eradication operation was dependant on its acceptance by the affected community”. During Operation Evergreen and subsequent eradication attempts, much effort and funding was used on communication with the wider community. On reading the review of Hosking et al. (2003), written by those directly involved in the programme, and the Ombudsman report (2007) based on complaints against the spray programmes against WSTM, PAM and AGM (detailed below), there are slightly different views on the success of community consultation, although both agree on a generally high level of public support for the programme. While the majority of residents were in favour of WSTM eradication, opposition to spraying increased in New Zealand following WSTM Operation Evergreen. The communication effort during Operation Evergreen was extensive and included free phone hotlines, public meetings and availability of environment (Ministry of Forests 1996) and health (Jenner Consultants Ltd 1996) impact assessments on the use of Foray 48B. Technical bulletins on the progress of the eradication effort, as well as on speciﬁc issues such pheromone trapping, choice of Btk as the agent and potential health issues were produced and distributed. However, the eradication programme was extensive, highly visible and prolonged, which led to an increase in opposition. Groups in New Zealand aligned to the Canadian Btk opposition groups emerged, such as the Society Targeting Overuse of Pesticides (STOP). Public health was the main concern in the community and remains the most controversial part of the three spray campaigns covered in this chapter. While some concern was expressed regarding the use of low ﬂying aircraft, most concern was focused on the Foray 48B product. The lack of public disclosure of the ingredients in Foray 48B was a source of public concern for this and subsequent eradication campaigns.
The health impacts of the urticating hairs of the tussock moth received little attention, although workers in the rearing facility were affected to the point of withdrawing from the programme (Hosking et al. 2003).
At one point, the Operation Evergreen team released 1,000 monarch butterﬂies, a public event recognising that widespread application of Btk to the area reduced Lepidoptera numbers. In reality, the application mostly in a relatively small residential area did not threaten any well-established species and emigration into the zone would quickly re-establish butterﬂy populations (e.g. Butler et al. 1995).

4.2.7 Outcome

While the spray programme ceased in 1996, it was 2 years before it could be judged successful. An intensive pheromone trapping programme based on the newly developed pheromone failed to ﬁnd any residual populations. In June 1998, with no individuals trapped for around 2 years, the WSTM was declared eradicated. The moth has not been seen in New Zealand since the end of Operation Evergreen.
There were many aspects of the programme that lead to a successful outcome. According to the leaders of the response team, the six key elements were: deﬁnition of infestation, prevention of spread, application of pesticide, intensive monitoring, strong science input and communication initiatives (Hosking et al. 2003).

4.3 Painted Apple Moth
After the successful eradication of the WSTM from Auckland, a second exotic lymantriid was found in 1999. The painted apple moth (PAM), Teia anartoides (formerly Orgyia anartoides), is a native of south-eastern Australia, from as far north as southern Queensland to Tasmania in the south. It is usually a minor problem as a pest of urban garden plants (Elliott et al. 1998) and occasionally orchards. It is, however, polyphagous and can feed on key horticultural and forestry species. In April 1999, PAM was found in the suburb of Glendene in Auckland. Insects of Australian origin are routinely found established in New Zealand, often blown over by prevailing winds. However, after the WSTM programme, the discovery of another lymantriid in Auckland, one which was considered polyphagous (Common 1990, Elliott et al. 1998), triggered serious concerns. As with third generation WSTM females, female PAM do not ﬂy, which generally limits the spread. PAM can have ﬁve generations a year, increasing the risk of colonization compared to WSTM, which had three or less.
Much of the information on the response to PAM can be found at the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) website (MAF 2007). It is possible to track the progress of the response to PAM through the MAF media releases, albeit with a very positive view of the programme. The Ombudsman report (2007) also provides a summary of the programme, in terms of timing, decisions and statistics. Other than those documents, no review of PAM eradication campaign has been compiled.

4.3.1 Detection
PAM was discovered in three properties in an industrial area in the western Auckland suburb of Glendene on the 5 May 1999. All life cycle stages of the moth were found (eggs, caterpillars, pupae and adults), suggesting the insect had been established locally for some time. The MAF had the properties and surrounding areas treated with the organophosphate insecticide, chlorpyrifos and/or Decis (a synthetic

58

T.R. Glare

pyrethroid insecticide) (MAF 2002a). A delimiting survey (visual ground search) was conducted within 2 weeks and resulted in several more properties in Glendene being treated. Another delimitation survey found no new populations and the threat was thought to be contained. However, by October 1999, PAM had been found both near the original infestation and a small population was also found in the suburb of Mt. Wellington, 15 km away. Because females don’t ﬂy, it was thought this was a separate infestation.
While ground spraying with chlorpyrifos and Decis was ongoing, the ofﬁcials and advisors were considering whether PAM was a serious threat to New Zealand. A preliminary economic impact assessment suggested costs of more than $NZ 48M (present value in 2000) could be incurred in plantation forestry over 20 years if PAM became widely established (MAF 2000). A second estimate using more detailed information put the potential economic cost of PAM at between $NZ 58–356 M over 20 years (MAF 2002b), mainly as a result of production losses and treatment costs in forestry. The conservation estate (native areas) was not included in the impact assessment, but the Department of Conservation considered potential impacts in these areas to also be signiﬁcant (MAF 2001a).
As with WSTM, no pheromone was available and for detection live females reared in laboratory colonies were used exclusively throughout the years that the PAM operation continued, a truly mammoth rearing task. Use of live females in traps started in December 2000, and eventually, over 600 traps covered the region from Glendene to Mt. Wellington. These live females were replaced approximately weekly. Between May and October 2001, trap catches reached almost 1,000 male moths, indicating spread of the populations, especially towards a large area of native bush on the edge of the city (Waitakere Ranges) (Ombudsman 2007). At the height of the programme, up to 1,880 traps were baited and serviced weekly, covering 62,000 ha (Anonymous 2007).

4.3.2 Response
The decision to attempt eradication was made very soon after the original discovery, but had to be revisited several times as new populations were found outside the treatment zone. In August 2000, Cabinet (made up of senior government Ministers) approved an eradication programme, using mainly ground sprays of the chemical insecticides and host plant removal, targeting preferred species. However, PAM remained and by October 2001, Cabinet had formed an advisory committee to make a recommendation on the preferred response.
The decision to use Foray 48B for eradication was enabled by evidence of high potency against PAM (M Kay et al. unpublished data quoted in the Environmental Impact Assessment, MAF 2003a). The success of the WSTM eradication programme and control of gypsy moth overseas using Foray 48B (both lymantriids like PAM), made the decision easier. It was likely that no agent other than Btk would have been acceptable to community groups. In fact, some members of the community advisory group, which was formed during the programme, requested that Btk be

4 Use of Pathogens for Eradication of Exotic Lepidopteran Pests in New Zealand

59

used for ground spraying instead of chlorpyrifos. Later there was opposition from some members of the community advisory group to aerial applications of Btk, partly on the basis of the more broad-scale nature of aerial application.
All PAM populations could not be reached by early ground spraying efforts, especially those in riparian strips and parks where high trees and terrain made ground application difﬁcult. Therefore, a limited aerial approach was taken. Because of previous opposition to aerial spraying during the WSTM programme, the spray area was concentrated on 600 ha around the Whau River riparian strips and a large parklike cemetery (Ombudsman 2007). Targeted spraying commenced in January 2002, aiming for seven to eight applications at 3- to 4-week intervals, affecting about 800 properties. One application took around 7 hours to cover the entire aerial spray zone of around 60 ha (MAF 2002a). Spraying continued until early June 2002. By May 2002, MAF had reported that the spray programme was having an impact, with total traps of male moths down from a high of around 900/week before spraying commenced to only 73/week in April 2002 (MAF 2002c). However, a signiﬁcant population still remained as winter reduced the activity of the moths. The treated area was gradually increased to 900 ha by September 2002. In total nine aerial sprays were completed in this period, mainly by helicopter and a ﬁxed wing Air Tractors.
It was clear that targeted spraying was not containing PAM, so more extensive aerial applications began in October, 2002. The area was increased to 8,000 ha and eventually covered 12,000 ha, with ten aerial applications at approximately 21-day intervals using a Fokker Friendship, an Air Tractor aircraft and a helicopter. Ground spraying continued wherever new populations were located, including spraying a new discrete population in Hobsonville, Auckland, in December 2002.
By the completion of spraying in May 2003, up to 43,000 homes and 193,000 people had been exposed to Foray 48B in the treated areas (Ombudsman 2007). Spraying had occurred over a 104-week period, with some 40 “operations” completed in that time (Ombudsman 2007). The spraying was concluded ofﬁcially in Auckland on 13 May 2004 (MAF 2004), when no moths had been captured for 4 months.
During the spray programme, restrictions were placed on the removal of garden waste from the infestation zone, to limit the spread. MAF offered free disposal of material. These restrictions were not lifted until March 2006 (MAF 2006).
The environmental impact assessment prepared for WSTM eradication using Btk was revised so that it was appropriate for the PAM eradication (MAF 2003a), including analysis of particular non-target impacts in the region (e.g. Glare & Hoare 2003). A Health Advisory Steering group was established to oversee a health monitoring programme. A Health Risk Assessment, which examined the potential impacts (Auckland District Health Board 2002) of the PAM programme, was completed.

4.3.3 Other Research
While eradication with Btk was the primary goal of the PAM operation, MAF continued to fund aligned research, both to provide tools and data to assist the

60

T.R. Glare

eradication, and to examine other control and eradication options. Through the ground surveys, data were collected on the host plants (and inanimate surfaces) preferred by PAM (Stephens et al. 2007). PAM was found mostly on wattle species (Acacia spp.), which are native to Australia, but also on several New Zealand native species.
Another study looked for other potential pathogens and parasites of PAM. The overall goal was to determine if any parasites or microbial pathogens present in New Zealand or identiﬁed in Australia had potential as control agents to slow the spread of PAM. A team collected PAM in Australia and attempted to rear and identify all parasitoids. They managed to rear 12 species of egg, larval, larval/pupal and possibly pupal parasites, mostly Hymenoptera from the families Braconidae, Ichneumonidae and super-family Chalcidoidea (P Gerard personal communication). Another team examined the potential to use other insect pathogens for PAM control: a nucleopolyhedrovirus had been previously identiﬁed from PAM in Australia (Teakle 1973) and a sample was obtained and shown to be virulent against PAM, using the New Zealand rearing colonies (Markwick et al. 2008). Similarly, the tussock moth nucleopolyhedroviruses (OpMNPV “VirtussTM” and OrleSNPV) from Canada were effective in the laboratory against PAM larvae (Markwick et al. 2005). A cypovirus (CPV) was also isolated from the rearing colonies of PAM, as occurred with WSTM. This time the virus was characterized using polyhedron sequences, and a new cypovirus was identiﬁed (Markwick et al. 2005).
Only one active pathogen was identiﬁed from wild populations of PAM in New Zealand, the fungus Beauveria bassiana. Isolates of B. bassiana from PAM in New Zealand were isolated, genotyped and bioassayed, showing potential as a control agent (Markwick et al. 2005).
A new approach was taken in the ﬁnal stages of the eradication programme, the release of sterile male moths. The sterile male programme was initiated to determine the ﬂight potential of male moths, as trap data using live females would often turn up single males from outlier traps, making it difﬁcult to determine the population spread. Other useful data such as temperature limits for ﬂight were determined (Suckling et al. 2005). Irradiation of females for trapping (to reduce risk of using reproductively active females) was also investigated (Suckling et al. 2002, 2006). The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) was aimed at releasing sterile males to disrupt the breeding cycle of PAM. In 2003, SIT was used in conjunction with spraying to complement the ﬁnal stages of eradication (Suckling et al. 2005, Wee et al. 2005).
The search for a synthetic pheromone was conducted by two competing teams. The two teams published preliminary results in the same issue of the Journal of Chemical Ecology (Gries et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2005), but no synthetic pheromone was ever available for use in the ﬁeld.

4.3.4 Public and Government Response and Regulation
There were several steps in the decision to eradicate PAM, such as scientiﬁc advice on eradication feasibility and estimates of potential impact of this exotic

4 Use of Pathogens for Eradication of Exotic Lepidopteran Pests in New Zealand

61

insect. However, overall, eradications that require millions of dollars are essentially political decisions based on the best advice available. The Government made the decision to support aerial spraying operations after over a year of ground operations failed to contain the PAM population.
The eradication operation was the subject of a number of legislations. Subsequent to the WSTM Operation Evergreen, the Biosecurity Act 1996 was passed into law. The Act provides MAF with the power to carry out aerial spraying and meant MAF could declare “controlled areas”, for example to restrict garden waste movement. Other legislation, such as the Resource Management Act that governed discharge of substances into the environment (including application of Btk), was bypassed by government decree, which provided exemption. The Civil Aviation Act covered approvals needed for low ﬂying aircraft involved in the spray programme. One district council found that the proposed use of helicopters for spraying would breach the bylaws about noise control and would require applications for resource consent (i.e. legislation would need to be overridden), which could have delayed the control process by many months. There were emergency override clauses in the Biosecurity Act (essentially allowing the government to bypass the law), but instead MAF had advice from government lawyers that the council plan was unlawful and spraying continued. Foray 48B was registered under the Pesticide Act for the WSTM programme and the registration needed to be modiﬁed to include PAM. Several other acts (e.g. the Reserves Act 1977 and the Conservation Act 1987) required Ministerial approval for use of biological agents.
Health issues had been raised during the WSTM operation and there were further concerns raised during the PAM eradication. A Health Risk Assessment of potential impacts was made available during the programme (Auckland District Health Board 2002). According to the Government media release, MAF “was aware the medical conditions of some people could be exacerbated by some of the components in Foray 48B” so independent health support services were set up (MAF 2004). Health studies were also conducted to monitor effects of the spray programme (Aeraqua Medical Services 2005a, b). Much debate continued about health effects from the Btk sprays and the Ombudsman study (2007) was created in response to continued public complaints about the spray programme and perceived health effects.
A PAM Community Advisory Group was set up to provide feedback about community concerns to the Ministry. It ﬁrst met in September 2001, but became a focus for opposition to the spray programme. This caused a disconnection between the technical advice and advice from the community advisory group, with the technical group backing the spray programme and the community group largely opposing spraying. Interestingly, MAF-funded surveys of the affected homes found 89% of people were neutral, agreed or strongly agreed with the eradication programme (MAF 2001b). MAF made efforts to reduce the impact of such a massive and highly visible eradication campaign, such as spraying on weekends when possible to minimize disruption to school children (MAF 2006).
The effect of the uricating hairs from PAM had a similar effect on laboratory workers as WSTM. One technician’s reaction was so severe she had to be removed

62

T.R. Glare

from the programme. Some ground spraying workers also suffered from the effects of the hairs (MAF 2003b).

4.3.5 Outcome
After the ﬁnal spray application in May 2003, it was not until March 2006 that the government ofﬁcially declared the eradication successful (MAF 2006, Stephens et al. 2007). The criterion used for declaring successful eradication was no moths found for 2 years. MAF reported that Auckland suburbs had been aerially treated 69 times between 1999 and 2003 (MAF 2006). The eradication campaign cost $NZ 62.4 M.
However, the declaration of eradication became complicated by the capture of single moths in other parts of Auckland in 2005 (MAF 2005). Investigation using molecular typing and stable isotope approaches determined these moths were not part of the original infestation, but were new arrivals. Isotope analysis indicated the moth trapped at Otahuhu in 2005 had pupated in a climate signiﬁcantly more arid that Auckland. This indicated the moth was a recent immigrant, rather than having originated in Auckland.
Kean & Suckling (2005) used a modelling approach to determine what interval was necessary to declare that PAM had been successfully eradicated. Based on trap data, they estimated that after around 9 months of negative trap data the probability that the core area had a resident population was very slight. Less concentrated trapping at the outer areas increased the time before eradication could conﬁdently be declared to around 2 years. The authors also included the effect of ﬁnding a single moth in Mt. Eden in 2005. This resulted in extra traps being deployed, which in turn decreased the time required before eradication could conﬁdently be declared.
Much had been learnt from the PAM eradication campaign and associated research. The use of speciﬁc regions of mtDNA (Ball & Armstrong 2006) and stable isotope testing (Iso-trace New Zealand Limited, Dunedin) to analyse the origin of moths was particularly useful. The SIT programme was also a success in assisting with the ﬁnal phase of eradication and in supplying vital data on the ﬂight range of male moths. In retrospect, wider areas of application were needed than initially used, but the public pressure against the use of aerial spraying meant that a limited application was considered the best ﬁrst option.

4.4 Asian Gypsy Moth
Much of the response to WSTM and PAM as lymantriid pests in New Zealand had stemmed from concern about the Asian strain of gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (AGM), reaching New Zealand. Therefore, it was not unexpected but somewhat ironic that an adult gypsy moth should be found in New Zealand during the response

4 Use of Pathogens for Eradication of Exotic Lepidopteran Pests in New Zealand

63

to PAM. The focus on the gypsy moth as a threat dated back to the early 1990s, which meant that resources were in place to respond to these other moth incursions more rapidly than if they had been other types of insects.
The threat of AGM to New Zealand had been reviewed in the 1990s (Cowley et al. 1993, Horgan 1994) and assessments concluded that almost inevitably, gypsy moth would reach New Zealand and that it would be a devastating pest. As a major outbreak pest of native and plantation forests and horticultural tree crops throughout the Northern Hemisphere, gypsy moth was not considered a threat (i.e. would not survive the transportation to New Zealand) until the “Asian” strain emerged, probably from North Asia/Far East with characteristics making survival across the equator more likely. The AGM strain was also considered more devastating than the North America/European gypsy moth strain, having a wider host range, females that ﬂy and was generally larger with a higher premature eclosion. From 1993, viable egg masses and other life stages of AGM were routinely found on ships and cargo in New Zealand ports (Kay et al. 2002).
A pheromone-based nationwide trapping programme was initiated in 1993, concentrating on ports and surroundings, with over 1,000 traps at one time. Somewhat surprisingly, the ﬁrst detection of a male moth was not from one of the international points of entry, but from one of only seven traps maintained in Hamilton, a medium-sized inland city in the North Island.

4.4.1 Detection
In March 2003, a single male gypsy moth was discovered in a pheromone trap in Hamilton. Detection of a single male moth led to much debate among the technical and scientiﬁc panel convened by MAF to determine a recommended response. There was no evidence from ground surveys of an infestation, although Hamilton has one of the largest populations of oak trees (Quercus spp.; a favoured host) in New Zealand. Many of these trees are tall, making location of egg masses difﬁcult. The single specimen was sent to Dr Robert Hoare (Landcare Research, New Zealand), who tentatively identiﬁed it as Lymantria dispar subspecies praeterea based on morphology (Bain & Ross 2003). L. d. praeterea has recently been reclassiﬁed as L. umbrosa (Pogue & Schaefer 2007), a species found naturally in Siberia and northern Japan. This species forms part of a L. dispar complex. Molecular analysis using a variable region of the 16S was completed, but lack of speciﬁc species representatives within the complex for comparison limited the study. The molecular analysis did indicate that the lone gypsy moth in Hamilton was similar to samples obtained from Honshu, Japan (outside of the known range for L. umbrosa), and East Russia (within the range), but dissimilar to those from southwest Hokkaido (at the limit of the range). However, these markers may not have been discriminatory enough to distinguish L. umbrosa from other sister species (K Armstrong personal communication). Given the lack of speciﬁc identiﬁcation, we continue the usage of the name AGM for this ﬁnd.

64

T.R. Glare

The advisory group debated the likelihood of a single moth representing a local population. Previous economic impact assessments had placed the cost to New Zealand of an AGM colonization at between $NZ 5M and 400 M (Ombudsman 2007), a large range. Given the risk, the technical advisory group recommended eradication using aerial spraying, as no population was found to target on the ground, but there was great likelihood that a local population existed. Given ﬂight times in Japan/Russia for male gypsy moth, the chances of an adult AGM being transported to New Zealand was very low.

4.4.2 Response
The response to the Hamilton ﬁnd of an AGM male was similar to responses to WSTM and PAM, except with more rapid decision-making and conﬁned to an aerial and trapping programme as no ground infestation was ever located. The difﬁculty in planning a response based on only a single trapped male with no ground population, was apparent as deﬁning the area to target was dependent on information on ﬂight patterns and behaviour of AGM overseas. Balancing the risk of allowing AGM to establish against spraying another urban population based on little tangible threat was problematic. The technical advisory group recommended an eradication programme, partly because the risk was high there was a population undetected and that every generation the response was delayed, eradication would become that much more difﬁcult.
The actual decision on spraying was taken by the Government, after weighing the potential risks against the public attitude to another spraying. In September 2003, Cabinet approved an aerial spray programme for Hamilton. Between October and November 2003, eight aerial applications were conducted over speciﬁc parts of Hamilton, using a total of 65,300 L of Foray 48B (5–7 L/ha) (Ross 2005). The area of application was around 1,253 ha, and some 30,600 people were estimated to be present in the application zone (Ombudsman 2007). The spraying occurred over 52 days at around 7-day intervals.
Because of the previous WSTM and concurrent PAM eradication campaigns using the same agent, Foray 48B, much of the background information on the spray programme was already available, such as a general Environmental Impact Assessment and Health Assessments on Foray 48B. Additions to the Environmental Impact Assessment were completed with speciﬁc focus on the Hamilton spray zone (e.g. Glare & Hoare 2003) and a newly revised Health Risk Assessment was available in 2003 (Auckland Regional Public Health Service 2003). In previous eradications, maintaining colonies of the pest were crucial to success, for use in lures and for bioassays. It would have been a difﬁcult decision to maintain a laboratory colony of AGM, given that no ground population was ever found and there is always the risk of escape. Approval to import AGM to start a colony was unlikely. As Foray 48B was extensively used overseas for AGM control based on abundant research, bioassays were unnecessary. As synthetic lures

4 Use of Pathogens for Eradication of Exotic Lepidopteran Pests in New Zealand

65

for the gypsy moth pheromone, Disparlure, were available, female AGM were not required.
The spray applications were conducted under the same regulations as for PAM, including use of the Biosecurity Act, which eliminated the need for any consent process under the Resource Management Act.

4.4.3 Other Research
Because AGM had been considered a likely invader of NZ since the early 1990s (e.g. Cowley et al. 1993, Horgan 1994), considerable research and thought had gone into potential responses. As stated above, the discovery of a lone AGM male was due to the extensive trapping programme based on the synthetic lure, Disparlure. Extensive studies examining New Zealand plants as potential hosts for AGM were carried out (Kay et al. 2002). Barlow et al. (2000) modeled the likely establishment and spread of AGM in New Zealand and the effects of control agents such as viral pathogens. Molecular identiﬁcation systems for AGM were developed and tested (Armstrong 2000, Armstrong & Cameron 2000, Armstrong et al. 2003).
Several control agents were considered and in some cases, preliminary work was conducted. Btk was always considered the most likely agent for control or eradication, but insect growth regulators, mating disruption using pheromones, chemical pesticides and microbial pathogens other than Btk were all considered (Glare et al. 1998, 2003). Of the known pathogens of gypsy moth, two were considered most likely potential agents for use in control or even eradication. The nucleopolyhedrovirus of L. dispar, LdMNPV, is produced in several countries and used as a spray-applied pesticide against GM. The virus was imported into containment in New Zealand and tested against a range of non-target insects to provide environmental safety data for any future use (Glare et al. 1995). Efforts were made to determine the availability and potential sources of LdMNPV from the USA and the Czech Republic (Glare et al. 2003). Similarly, the fungus Entomophaga maimaiga, which had proved so effective in the USA against gypsy moth (Chapter 11), was imported into containment but was never used (TR Glare unpublished data).
4.4.4 Outcome
The eradication operation was completed by November 2003 and cost approximately $NZ 7M. No subsequent AGM were trapped and a ground population was never found. Some Hamilton residents applied to the High Court of New Zealand to stop the spraying before it commenced, but were unsuccessful. According to the Ombudsman (2007) analysis, Hamilton residents within the spray zone received 37% more Foray 48B per ha than those exposed to the PAM eradication programme. MAF declared eradication of the gypsy moth from Hamilton on 26 May 2005, after

66

T.R. Glare

enough time for two generations to have passed with no further trap catches or other stages found (Ross 2005).

4.5 Conclusions
With the eradication of two established and one possibly established lymantriids in two cities, New Zealand has shown that urban eradication using microbial pathogens is possible. It was remarkable that aerial application (also with ground-based efforts) was able to be conducted over these cities. There were many lessons learnt from the three eradication programmes. The logistics involved in organization of all aspects of the programmes were substantial. From acquiring the hundreds of thousands of litres of Foray 48B, organizing planes, liaising with various relevant authorities, to community communications and answering the thousands of queries, the teams involved were effective. There was a learning process for the relevant government agencies about how to best integrate opinions from technical, community and government perspectives, which often have very different inputs.
In all cases the most contentious area of these eradication programmes was human health aspects of spraying large populations with a pesticide, even if biological, from the air. The debate and investigation into possible health impacts is ongoing, as demonstrated by the public complaints that led to the Ombudsman’s (2007) investigation (published numerous years after the actual spraying occurred). The Ombudsman’s report concluded that “insufﬁcient attention was paid to the impacts of [the spray] operations” (summary, page 8). As the Ombudsman points out, continued support for such programmes from the public will be critical for any future programmes to be conducted. The recognition that sprays will cause some medical issues, such as respiratory complaints or allergic reactions, seems to be understood, but was not, in the Ombudsman view, sufﬁciently publicised. While most of the community recognized the need for aerial spraying, there appeared to be a decline in support over time. There was also a lack of trust of the government agencies and science teams, much of it around the lack of disclosure of all of the ingredients of Foray 48B (which is a trade secret). Disclosure to ofﬁcials was not deemed enough for some of the New Zealand public. There is an obvious dilemma around the lack of disclosure of formulations to be used in large scale eradication programmes.
Overall, the Ministry of Health reported “no adverse health patterns found, when considered at the population level” (Auckland District Health Board 2002). There remain a limited number of people implacably opposed to spray programmes, especially aerial spraying over high density urban environments.

North American Eradications of Asian and European Gypsy Moth
Ann E. Hajek and Patrick C. Tobin

Abstract Although European gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar dispar) is established in the northeastern and northern midwestern parts of North America, members of the three subspecies of gypsy moth are constantly being introduced into new locations. Between 1980 and 2007, multiple eradication efforts targeting gypsy moth populations were conducted in 24 states in the US. In more recent years, eradication efforts have also slowed the westward and southern spread of gypsy moth. Of particular concern are introductions of the Asian and Japanese gypsy moths. The former has a broader host range than L. dispar dispar, and in both strains females are capable of ﬂight. Consequently, the threshold for initiating an eradication effort against Asian and Japanese gypsy moth populations is much lower than it is for European gypsy moth. In some cases, the detection of as few as one Asian gypsy moth could trigger an eradication effort. A critical component that enables eradication projects against gypsy moth to be successful is the availability of a sensitive monitoring tool that can detect very low density, newly-establishing gypsy moth populations. The primary method for eradication of gypsy moth today is use of the HD-1 strain of Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (Btk). For eradication programs, aerial applications of Btk are generally applied 2–3 times when early instars are present.

5.1 Introduction
Lymantria dispar, commonly known as the gypsy moth, is native from Europe and North Africa across Asia to Japan (Pogue & Schaefer 2007). The taxonomy of gypsy moth has been very contentious in the past but it was always generally agreed that the gypsy moth in Europe (Lymantria dispar dispar; EGM) is a separate entity from gypsy moths in Asia. EGM is the gypsy moth subspecies that was introduced (from France) to northeastern North America in 1869 (Riley & Vasey 1870, Forbush & Fernald 1896). This polyphagous tree defoliator is capable of outbreaks that have

periodically decimated the hardwood forests of the northeast (Elkinton & Liebhold 1990), while also spreading to the south and west (6–18 km/year; Tobin et al. 2007). It is generally assumed that one of the reasons that EGM has spread so slowly is because females are ﬂightless (Sharov 2004). Analyses of the historical spread of EGM have suggested that in the absence of anthropogenic movement of life stages, natural spread (via ballooning early instars) could be as slow as 2.5 km/year (Liebhold et al. 1992).
Two subspecies of Lymantria dispar occur in Asia: L. dispar asiatica is known as Asian gypsy moth (AGM) and is distributed mostly east of the Ural Mountains and in China and Korea, while L. dispar japonica (Japanese gypsy moth) is distributed on the main islands of Japan, although the distribution on Hokkaido is limited (Pogue & Schaefer 2007). It is presumed that both of the Asian subspecies, if introduced to North America, would be more problematic than EGM. Although all of the L. dispar subspecies are polyphagous, studies have shown that L. dispar asiatica has a wider host plant range, which includes more conifers than EGM (Baranchikov 1989, Baranchikov & Montgomery 1994). All three subspecies are known for their abilities to increase to outbreak densities. Eggs of Russian gypsy moths (= AGM) required less exposure to cold before hatch compared with EGM (Keena 1996). However, in contrast with EGM, the females of both subspecies of Asian gypsy moth are also capable of either sustained level or ascending ﬂight (Pogue & Schaefer 2007), which would likely facilitate their spread. There is evidence suggesting that nocturnal mass migrations of variable lengths occur in L. dispar asiatica. As an additional form of dispersal, newly hatched AGM caterpillars balloon on the wind, as do EGM neonates (Zlotina et al. 1999).
European and Asian gypsy moths have been ﬂagged worldwide as species that should be prevented from entering new areas, largely due to the long history of negative ecological and socioeconomic impacts caused by EGM in North America and the history of L. dispar outbreaks in areas where these subspecies are native (Campbell & Sloan 1977, Doane & McManus 1981, Leuschner et al. 1996, Redman & Scriber 2000). Gypsy moth life stages, predominantly egg masses, are transported relatively frequently. When standard pathways can be identiﬁed, analyses have shown that gypsy moth introductions are more frequent in years following outbreaks in source areas (Myers & Rothman 1995). Programs to detect L. dispar in areas where it does not occur are constantly under way worldwide, most notably in areas that serve as primary ports-of-entry for international commerce and shipping routes. Also, several ports-of-egress, especially in Asia where AGM is native, are monitored through international collaborative programs to pre-emptively minimize the arrival of gypsy moth life stages into North America.
When populations of EGM are detected through monitoring programs in areas of North America where they are not established, one management response is to increase pheromone-baited trap density in the following year to better determine the extent of the infestation (= delimitation trapping). However, if male trap catch is high enough, or if other life stages such as egg masses are detected in subsequent surveys, eradication efforts are initiated. In the case of AGM and hybrids between AGM and EGM, the threshold for male moth trap catch that triggers erad-

ication efforts is lower than the threshold for EGM. Thus, efforts to eradicate incipient populations of AGM are much more aggressive than those against EGM. AGM and AGM hybrids have been detected in western North America, such as in British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho and Texas, and also on the East Coast, at ports in North and South Carolina (Zlotina et al. 1999, Johnson et al. 2007). In addition, eradications against highly localized EGM populations are constantly being conducted in areas of North America along the leading edge of the population front where gypsy moth is not yet established. Today, regardless of whether AGM or EGM is the target for an eradication program, bacterial and viral pathogens of gypsy moth are the mortality agents used most frequently. Here, we will provide background information on the use of eradication as a management strategy against the gypsy moth, the biopesticides that are used in such endeavors, and then we describe a diversity of eradication programs that have been undertaken in North America.

5.1.1 General Requirements for Successful Eradication Campaigns
Programs to eradicate an unwanted species can be very challenging and costly to implement, and are not always successful (Dahlsten et al. 1989, Myers et al. 1998, 2000). Although some native species have been targeted for eradication, it is a tactic that is more commonly used against non-native (invasive) species. Myers et al. (2000) identiﬁed conditions necessary for a successful eradication campaign. First, eradication programs generally require more resources than standard pest management programs; thus, for success, available resources must be sufﬁcient to see the eradication program through. Second, invasive species may be present on private land as well as public, so it is critically important that government agencies responsible for the eradication program have the authority to apply treatments where and when they are necessary. This can be especially problematic with invasive species that often occur in urban and suburban areas where they have been transported by humans. Efﬁcient control measures and strategies must also be available to prevent reinvasion and/or reduce propagule pressure.
A critical element in successful eradication programs is the availability of a monitoring tool that is effective at detecting low density populations. Most founding populations of non-native species arrive at such low densities that a majority of (but not all) new invasions fail to establish (Williamson & Fitter 1996, Ludsin & Wolfe 2001, Simberloff & Gibbons 2004). This is also the case for gypsy moth, as many, but once again not all, very low density populations (as determined through male moth trap catch) go extinct in the following year without any management intervention (Liebhold & Bascompte 2003, Whitmire & Tobin 2006). Yet, for eradication of a new invader to be a feasible management goal, a rapid response to the invasion is paramount since the feasibility and costs of eradication are directly related to the degree of establishment (Rejma´nek & Pitcairn 2002).

A.E. Hajek, P.C. Tobin

Gypsy moth has been successfully eradicated many times from many areas because most of these conditions are fulﬁlled, except for the condition regarding reintroduction. Gypsy moth females are very fecund, egg masses can be difﬁcult to detect, and the eggs go into diapause and require a prolonged winter chill before hatching. Thus, gypsy moth egg masses can be deposited on ships or goods in summer, the eggs go into winter diapause and hatch many months later, during which time the ships or goods can easily have been transported to another place. Thus, through globalization, gypsy moth has been and repeatedly continues to be introduced to new areas.

5.2 Detection and Biopesticide Use
In the 1970s a sex pheromone attracting gypsy moth males was developed for detection of L. dispar (Bierl et al. 1970, Beroza & Knipling 1972). The same pheromone (disparlure) attracts all of the different subspecies of L. dispar (Pogue & Schaefer 2007) and this pheromone has been used extensively for detection (USDA APHIS 2001, Tobin & Blackburn 2007). Detection of low density populations is a major requirement for eradication campaigns. Pheromone-baited traps are the most sensitive method for detecting gypsy moth and are very effective at both low and high densities. As populations increase, land managers may also be able to ﬁnd egg masses (which are present for ca 10 months of the year), larvae and pupae (which are present for only a limited time each year) and even remains of all life stages. The presence of egg masses and other immature life stages, for example, usually denotes a reproducing, and hence established, population for which an eradication effort would then be implemented. In contrast, the presence of only males in traps does not necessarily denote an established population, and depending on the numbers of males trapped and the subspecies, the appropriate management response could be to initiate delimitation trapping (more intensive trapping to understand the distribution in detail).
Although EGM and AGM are morphologically quite similar, on close examination, there are enough morphological differences that subspecies can sometimes be differentiated. However, molecular methods are now principally relied upon to conﬁrm gypsy moth subspecies, especially when hybridization among subspecies might have occurred. Early techniques that were developed to distinguish between AGM and EGM used mitochondrial DNA (e.g. Bogdanowicz et al. 1993). However, it became clear that these subspecies can hybridize. Since mitochondria are passed only from females to offspring, using mitochondrial DNA identiﬁes only the genotype of the maternal parent, thus providing incomplete information about hybrids. Therefore, methods for differentiation based on gypsy moth nuclear DNA were developed (e.g. Garner & Slavicek 1996, Schreiber et al. 1997, Reineke & Zebitz 1999). If the subspecies of gypsy moth males in pheromone-baited traps are in question, specimens are sent to labs operated by the US and Canadian governments and identities are conﬁrmed.

5.2.1 Biopesticides Used for Eradication

For many years, scientists in North America compared strains of Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (Btk) to select the strains most active against gypsy moth and then worked on optimizing formulation and application methods (Reardon et al. 1994, see Chapter 11). A strain was identiﬁed (HD-1) that is highly active against gypsy moth larvae and this strain was developed for control. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, when eradication became more feasible due to availability of monitoring tools (i.e. pheromone-baited traps) that were effective at low densities, Btk was not used very widely in eradication. Instead, chemical insecticides such as carbaryl were more commonly used. However, as application delivery methods were reﬁned and Btk products were improved, trends changed and now Btk is often the only product used in eradication programs (Fig. 5.1). Today, the principle Btk product that is used is Foray , which contains HD-1 (Valent Biosciences Corporation 1998). It is used as a ﬂowable formulation at either 12.7 BIU/L (48 BIU/gal) or 20 BIU/L (76 BIU/gal) in Foray 48B and Foray 76B, respectively, and is manufactured by Valent BioSciences. Present day usage is usually 4.67 L/ha (0.5 gal/acre) for Foray 48B or 3.1 L/ha (0.33 gal/acre) for Foray 76B. The label for Foray 48B products restricts its use to 20–99 BIU/ha (8–40 BIU/acre) per application. These products are applied for suppression programs (i.e. programs to mitigate gypsy moth outbreaks) as well as eradication but the amounts applied differ. Eradication programs usually use multiple aerial applications with doses ranging from 59 to 94 BIU/ha (24–38 BIU/acre) or higher, with 5–10 days between the multiple applications. It seems that there is a trend toward two applications in the southern US and three applications in the western US, with the aggressiveness of the treatments often increasing with increasing distance from established gypsy moth populations (i.e. gypsy moth infestations on the west coast, such as in Washington, Oregon

and California, are much further from the constantly spreading established gypsy moth population than infestations in the south, such as in North Carolina). In contrast, suppression programs often use single or double aerial applications of 59–89 BIU/ha.
Btk was selected for use in eradication campaigns because it is generally recognized as the safest insecticide to humans that is currently available in quantities for gypsy moth control. This is especially important in urban areas where, due to anthropogenic movement of life stages, most infestations are detected. Applicators must take care because this material must be applied when 2nd – 3rd instars are feeding to obtain optimal results. In addition, it should not be applied directly before rain. Second and 3rd instars are generally active for only approximately 2 weeks in early spring, and in periods of rain it can be difﬁcult to apply Btk on the appropriate schedule.
The gypsy moth nucleopolyhedrovirus (LdMNPV) is mass produced in the US by the USDA Forest Service and is formulated as the registered product Gypchek (Chapter 11). Availability of Gypchek is limited because it can only be produced in vivo and thus is very labor-intensive and costly to manufacture (Reardon et al. 1996). Because LdMNPV is more host speciﬁc than Btk, this material is principally used for gypsy moth control in environmentally sensitive areas, when there is concern for non-target effects of Btk on native Lepidoptera, such as the endangered Karner Blue butterﬂy, Lycaeides melissa samuelis (USDA Forest Service 1995). Gypchek is also used for research. As for Btk, LdMNPV must be ingested to be effective and early larval instars are more susceptible than later larval instars.

5.3 Case Studies of Eradication Programs
5.3.1 British Columbia
British Columbia has been concerned about introductions of gypsy moth since egg masses from Japan were ﬁrst intercepted in 1911 (British Columbia Ministry of Forest & Range 2007). After pheromone-baited traps became available, the ﬁrst male gypsy moth was trapped in 1978 (Bell 1994). Ground searches in the area found egg masses on a canoe and garden furniture that had originated from Quebec, a province hosting established populations of gypsy moth at that time. This became a regular pattern seen throughout North American areas that are outside of the gypsy moth established area: introductions of gypsy moth in uninfested areas are generally due to the accidental transport of life stages by humans, such as through commercial trade, household moves, and travel (Doane and McManus 1981, McFadden & McManus 1991). Since 1978, both AGM and EGM have repeatedly been detected in British Columbia. Between 1979 and 1999, male gypsy moths were captured at 120 sites and, at 20 of these sites, eradication programs were undertaken (Myers 2003). Two of these eradication programs are described below.

5.3.1.1 Asian Gypsy Moth Infestation in the Vancouver Area: 1991–1995
The interception of AGM egg masses on ships in Vancouver and Victoria in 1982 and 1989 presaged the infestation to come. Due to shipping patterns at the time, grain ships from the Russian Far East spent warmer months in the Soviet Arctic waters and then came to Canada the following spring to load grain, approximately when gypsy moth egg masses that had been laid on ships in Russia the previous summer would hatch. In 1991, Canadian inspectors found AGM egg masses on empty ships from the Russian Far East that were in the port of Vancouver waiting to load grain. It is assumed that some of the neonates hatching from egg masses blew to trees on the shore because adult male gypsy moths were subsequently trapped on shore. The speciﬁc pathway for this introduction was clariﬁed based on the fact that adult gypsy moths are attracted to light (Wallner et al. 1995) and AGM females can ﬂy. During the 1980s and 1990s, gypsy moth outbreaks were occurring in the Russian Far East. AGM adults were attracted to the well-lit grain terminals at the edges of forested areas where ships were loaded and unloaded and egg masses were laid on ships. After these ships made their way to Paciﬁc Northwest ports, e.g. Vancouver and Seattle, hatching egg masses were visually detected on the ships.
In 1989, 80 AGM egg masses were found on a ship at Victoria, BC (British Columbia Ministry of Forest & Range 2007). By 1990, hundreds of AGM egg masses, along with some hatching larvae were found on another vessel and, by 1991, thousands of AGM egg masses with ballooning larvae were found on 29 infested grain ships in Vancouver harbor, at which time a ban was put into effect. By 1992, Canadian authorities had banned 16 ships from entering the port of Vancouver when AGM egg masses and some hatching larvae were found on them.
After 23 AGM males were detected in pheromone-baited traps in and around the port of Vancouver in 1991 (Fig. 5.2), in 1992 an area of 20,000 ha in the city of Vancouver was sprayed from the air three times with Btk at 50 BIU/ha at a cost of approximately $Canadian 6 million (Myers 2003). Subsequently, from 1993 through 1995, 8 male AGM were trapped in the Vancouver area but no further spraying was conducted (Fig. 5.2). After 1995, no more AGM were trapped and ofﬁcials declared AGM eradicated from the Vancouver area.

5.3.1.2 European Gypsy Moth Eradication in the Victoria Area: 1999
Male EGM were found quite regularly in pheromone-baited traps in British Columbia from 1978 to 2007, but generally in low numbers (Fig. 5.2). Between 1995 and 1998, EGM populations were increasing on southern Vancouver Island. Numbers of males collected in traps increased from 5 to 503 at 14+ locations over this period, and egg masses were also found from 1996 to 1998 (British Columbia Ministry of Forest & Range 2007). In 1998, an aerial spray program was proposed but the action was blocked by citizen protest. However, in 1999, a $Canadian 3 million spray program was undertaken to eradicate the EGM infestation. Foray 48B was applied aerially to > 13, 400 ha on Vancouver Island, of which 12,204 ha were in the greater Victoria region (de Amorim et al. 2001). The spray zone included a

mix of residential and rural areas, where approximately 75,420 people lived. The area considered to be infested was also regulated so that Christmas trees, nursery stock and outdoor household articles could not be moved to unregulated areas in the US without prior inspection. This EGM eradication program was considered a complete success (see de Amorim et al. 2001). One year after the Btk treatments, two adult males were trapped but no egg masses were detected in the treated areas; consequently, the threat of an embargo against lumber products from British Columbia was removed (USDA APHIS 2000).

5.3.2 Washington: Asian Gypsy Moth
The northwestern US state of Washington has undertaken aggressive EGM survey programs since 1974 (Alexander 1992). AGM was detected on the shore of North America late in 1991 near the port of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada (see above), and male AGM were also found in traps in Washington and Oregon that year (USDA APHIS 2003). The exact source of the Washington and Oregon infestations is not known but it is thought that ships coming from the Russian Far East that were infested with egg masses probably introduced AGM to North America while visiting ports on the West Coast. Through a grid of 11,439 pheromone-baited traps deployed in 1991, nine AGM were found at eight locations in two counties near the port of Tacoma (Washington State Dept. Agriculture 2007). An eradication program was implemented between 21 April and 24 May1992, during which 47,146 ha were treated with Btk (Foray 48B) through aerial applications. The applications required 24 helicopters and the coordinated efforts of a team of > 100 people from eight different federal and state agencies (Alexander 1992). The gypsy moth trapping program became more aggressive in 1992, with 129,299 pheromone-baited traps

deployed in Washington State (Washington State Dept. Agriculture 2007). No AGM males were trapped in the spray zone after the 1992 treatments and the eradication was considered a success (Alexander 1992). The number of traps decreased in 1993 to nearly 30,000 and from 1994 to 2006, the number of traps varied from 18,698 to 36,166 yearly. However, between 1992 and 1994, eight AGM/EGM hybrids were detected. These moths were genetically similar to hybrids found in Germany and it was suspected that they had been introduced during transport of military materials to Fort Lewis in Washington from Germany (see Section 5.3.3. below). One of the hybrid detection sites was treated in spring of 1995 to eradicate this infestation and, after 2 years of zero trap catch, eradication at this site was considered successful. Interestingly, between 1992 and 1994 the catches of EGM per year ranged from 173 to 458 but EGM was not a priority and no actions were taken to eradicate EGM populations (Washington State Dept. Agriculture 2007).
From 1995 to 1999 six AGM and three AGM/EGM hybrids were detected in Washington State (Washington State Dept. Agriculture 2007). Small-scale eradication programs were conducted at seven different sites during this period, each of which had trapped only one moth (all AGM or one of the hybrids). For example, in response to one AGM trapped in 1999, Foray 48B was applied aerially three times at 7 day intervals in Seattle in May 2000 (Washington State Dept. Health 2001). The eradication effort targeted approximately 259 ha of the Ballard and Magnolia areas of Seattle. This is an urban area with an estimated 2,200 businesses and properties and an estimated residential population of 6,600. For each eradication program between 1995 and 1999, eradication was declared to be successful following 2 years of zero trap catch from treated areas.

5.3.3 North Carolina: Hybrids of Asian and European Gypsy Moth
In addition to invasion pathways that arise through global trade and travel, the transport of military cargo can also introduce gypsy moth populations to North America. Such an introduction occurred on 4 July 1993 when a container ship hauling US military cargo arrived from Nordenham, Germany, and docked at the Military Ocean Terminal in Sunny Point, North Carolina (Garcia 1993). At the time of the ship’s departure from Germany (21 June), many regions of Europe, including Germany, were experiencing gypsy moth outbreaks. Upon docking, moths were seen emerging from infested cargo containers, and subsequent inspections revealed that the ship, the USCS Advantage, was infested with a hybrid strain of adult gypsy moths containing both Asian and European DNA. At the time, AGM was not known to occur in Europe. However, tracebacks of this introduction and also two others (military freight from Germany that arrived in Baltimore, Maryland and Charleston, South Carolina, in 1994) subsequently conﬁrmed the presence of AGM in Germany (Prasher & Mastro 1994). The ship was ordered back to sea on 6 July and remained approximately 5 miles from port until adult moth activity ceased. The USCS Advantage returned to port on 15 July, and fumigation of all cargo with methyl bromide began on 16 July.

In addition to fumigation, pheromone-baited and light traps were deployed at ≈ 350 m intervals from the mouth of the Cape Fear River (approximately 6.5 km south of the Sunny Point Military Ocean Terminal), to roughly 16 km north of Sunny Point. These traps were placed in addition to the North Carolina state-wide trapping grid, which, in 1993, included the deployment of pheromone-baited traps across the entire state (Roberts 2008). Traps from the vicinity of the port recorded > 400 moths, including > 300 from traps deployed on Sunny Point property. Several hundred egg masses were also removed from the ship and its cargo (Garcia 1993).
Based upon the trapping data and in consultation with a management and science advisory panel, the port and surrounding areas were divided into ﬁve priority areas. The highest priority area was in New Hanover and Brunswick counties, which included the port of Sunny Point. In 1994, 55,838 ha of this area were treated with two applications of Foray 48B. A third application was made over 2,637 ha at the port (South 1994). Two applications of the commercial formulation of the gypsy moth virus, Gypchek , were used on an additional 2,388 ha deemed environmentallysensitive (South 1994). In 1994 and 1995, delimiting grids were placed around treatment blocks, and post-treatment moth counts in the high priority area totalled < 10 in both 1994 and 1995 (Roberts 2008). Although the 1994 eradication program was mostly successful, supplemental applications of Foray 48B were considered necessary to completely eliminate Asian gypsy moth from the area; 2,566 hectares were treated in 1995 and 603 hectares were treated in 1996. No gypsy moths with Asian DNA were detected in 1996 and 1997 and this eradication was then considered successful (USDA Forest Service 1996, 1997).

5.3.4 The Slow the Spread Program: Eradication at the Edge of the Gypsy Moth Distribution
Gypsy moth currently occupies roughly one-third of the susceptible habitat in North America, and continues to invade new habitats at variable rates (Tobin et al. 2007). New colonies often arise along the leading edge of the population front (Sharov & Liebhold 1998) through a process known as stratiﬁed dispersal that combines short-range (usually through ballooning neonates) and long-range (usually through the anthropogenic movement of life stages or meteorological transport mechanisms) dispersal (Hengeveld 1989, Shigesada et al. 1995). Colonies that arise in a transition zone between the infested and uninfested areas of the gypsy moth distribution then grow and coalesce with the population front, which greatly contributes to and enhances the rate of gypsy moth spread. Under the gypsy moth Slow the Spread (STS) Program (Tobin & Blackburn 2007), these newly-established, spatially disjunct colonies are detected and delimited through the use of pheromone-baited traps, and then aggressively targeted for eradication to limit their inﬂuence on the rate of spread (Fig. 5.3).
One of the principle management tactics used in the STS Program is aerial applications of Btk (Reardon et al. 1994). During the pilot STS Program (1996–1999),

Fig. 5.3 Interpolated male moth density from pheromone-baited traps deployed in West Virginia (WV), Virginia (VA), and North Carolina (NC) under the Gypsy Moth Slow the Spread Program (Roberts 2008). Within a transition zone along the population front (outlined by dashed lines), incipient colonies are detected and eradicated to minimize their contribution to gypsy moth rates of spread
the use of Btk was the dominant treatment tactic (> 85, 389 ha treated with Btk, which represented 69.0% of all treated hectares, Tobin & Blackburn 2007). Today, Btk is often the tactic of choice, as opposed to other control tactics such as mating disruption (Thorpe et al. 2006), when infestations are abundant (i.e. generally maximum pheromone-baited trap catch > 30) or when life stages (i.e. egg masses) have been documented. In some cases, if a high infestation occurs within a larger area requiring treatment, Btk will be used in concert with mating disruption by using Btk to target the “hot spot” within a larger mating disruption block. Since 2000, approximately 258,594 ha have been treated with Btk under the STS Program.
In STS, Btk doses generally range from 59 to 94 BIU/ha using either one or two applications during the period of early instar activity. A summary of the use of Btk in STS, including doses, area treated, and pre- and post-treatment male moth density is presented in Table 5.1. There are several factors that are considered when determining the appropriate dose and number of applications, including the presence of egg masses (which generally increases the dose and/or number of applications) and budgetary constraints (which generally decreases the dose and/or number of applications). However, the primary factors are the initial male moth density, as recorded through pheromone-baited traps, and the distance of the treatment block

from the infested area (Fig. 5.4). Higher density infestations are generally targeted using a higher dose and/or number of applications, while infestations that are farther away from the infested area, but also more often of lower density, are targeted with a lower dose but with multiple applications (Fig. 5.4). This is because infestations farther away from the infested area contribute proportionally more to the rate of spread under stratiﬁed dispersal (see Chapter 3) than those that are closer.
A lesser used tactic under the Slow the Spread Program is the use of LdMNPV, formulated as Gypchek (Reardon et al. 1996). Because it is a naturally-occurring, highly host speciﬁc virus of the gypsy moth but availability is limited, Gypchek is solely used in environmentally-sensitive habitats. Since 2000, approximately 17,401 ha have been treated under the STS Program using Gypchek .

Within the transition zone, higher density populations close to areas where gypsy moth is established tend to be targeted with higher doses, and for eradicating populations farther away, 2 applications are used even when densities are lower

5.3.5 Smaller Eradication Efforts
On a regular basis, gypsy moth is detected across the US in areas where it is not already established. Eradication programs have been conducted in 24 US states between 1980 and 2007 (Fig. 5.5A); while some of these states were near the leading edge of the gypsy moth population front in 1980 and 2007 (the thickened lines), many were not. States vary in the frequency of years that they have used Btk in eradication programs, although many of the states with the most experience with eradication programs (i.e. more years of eradication programs) have frequently used Btk. Figure 5.5B shows that frequently when states had large areas being treated in eradication programs they opted to rely totally on Btk.
In recent years, there have been two smaller eradication programs in Oregon that are of particular interest. Gypsy moth is no stranger to Oregon where large eradication programs against EGM occurred in 1984–1985 (Youngs 1985) and where AGM was eradicated in the early 1990s. In fact, between 1980 and 2006, 23 eradication programs were conducted in Oregon. In the early 2000s, gypsy moth trap catches were relatively low for a couple of years. However, in 2006, trap catches jumped from 9 (in 2005) to 66 (Oregon Department of Agriculture 2006). Of the 66 male moths trapped, 57 were EGM that had been trapped at one location near Bend, Oregon. Survey technicians discovered the source: in 2005 a property owner had purchased a 1967 Chevrolet over the internet auction site eBay from a seller in Connecticut, a northeastern state where gypsy moth has been established since at least 1914 (Burgess 1930, Liebhold et al. 1992), and the vehicle contained viable gypsy moth egg masses. Egg masses were also detected on trees on the property,

conﬁrming that a reproducing population had successfully established. Another case involved detection of one AGM male that was trapped along the Columbia River, a large river where cargo ships arrive from Asia. Both of these infestations were treated with Btk following standard application protocols (three applications of Btk at each site; 259 ha for the area with the single AGM male and 216 ha for the EGM infestation) (Johnson et al. 2007). As a result, no moths were trapped at either site in 2007; 2 more years of no AGM catches and 1 more year of no EGM catches at the

5 North American Eradications of Asian and European Gypsy Moth

85

treated sites will be necessary to declare eradication. Additionally, in 2006, traps at other locations contained from 1 to 3 EGM males but these areas were not treated, demonstrating the differential threshold for treating populations of EGM relative to AGM (Oregon Department of Agriculture 2006).

5.4 Conclusions
Slowing the spread of EGM along its population front in the US and eradicating new gypsy moth infestations outside of the areas where EGM is established are taken very seriously in the US and Canada. Of even greater concern is AGM: new AGM infestations are treated much more aggressively than new infestations of EGM, e.g. the presence of even one AGM can lead to multiple aerial applications of Btk. It is a testament to the effectiveness, low non-target effects, and availability of Btk that this biopesticide has transitioned from being a minor component to the primary material used for eradication programs. In addition, LdMNPV is used to eradicate gypsy moth populations in environmentally sensitive areas; it is generally the case that each year, more requests for LdMNPV product are made than can be ﬁlled.
Invasive species often arrive where people live and work because they are frequently transported through human activities; thus, control activities must often be conducted in urban/suburban areas. Such is the case with gypsy moth. There has been public dissent regarding applications of Btk during some eradication programs conducted in urban areas (Myers et al. 2000, also see Chapter 4). A recently published book written on the ﬁrst eradication effort against gypsy moth (1890–1901) was motivated by the author’s disapproval of eradication efforts in Maryland in the 1990s (Spear 2005). Eradication has principally been criticized by the public due to concern about the potential for health effects as well as non-target effects from exposure to Btk (see Chapters 16, 17 and 18). The protest groups opposing use of Btk have questioned whether eradication programs are really necessary. However, if, for example, articles from Canada destined to be sent to the US are potentially contaminated by gypsy moth egg masses, the US might not accept them and this would clearly have a strong impact on trade. Other major costs of a gypsy moth infestation are tree mortality (Doane and McManus 1981, Gansner & Herrick 1984, Herrick & Gansner 1987), nuisance in urban and recreational areas (Payne et al. 1973, Moeller et al. 1977, Webb et al. 1991) and potential allergic reactions to the urticating hairs (Tuthill et al. 1984) associated with gypsy moth outbreaks.
Still, there is debate regarding the necessity for eradication programs; Myers (2003) suggested that if gypsy moth were to become established in British Columbia, environmental effects might not be as extensive as suggested by government agencies. She suggests that the expensive eradication programs are triggered by trade issues rather than concerns for nature and these priorities are not supported by all of the public. However, an economic analysis conducted in 1993 estimated that the beneﬁts of detection and eradication in British Columbia at that time

86

A.E. Hajek, P.C. Tobin

outweighed the costs of an annual suppression program by ten to one (Oliver 1994). A similar beneﬁt-to-cost-analysis conducted on the Slow the Spread Program revealed a corresponding 4-to-1 ratio, with the primary beneﬁt due to delaying the costs and losses due to gypsy moth in residential areas (Leuschner et al. 1996).
Authorities have instituted programs to prevent the arrival of AGM at US ports, as well as to minimize the potential for the transport of gypsy moth from overseas ports. However, until there are further improvements in our management of invasion pathways, gypsy moth, and other non-native species, will continue to be introduced through global trade and travel (Work et al. 2005, Liebhold et al. 2006, McCullough et al. 2006). Because of its effectiveness, availability and relatively low non-target effects, Btk will likely remain a primary management strategy in gypsy moth eradication efforts, at least for the near future.

Exotic Aphid Control with Pathogens
Charlotte Nielsen and Stephen P. Wraight

Abstract Exotic aphids are invading ecosystems worldwide. The principal factors favoring establishment of these invasive pests are their small size, parthenogenetic reproduction, short generation time, ability for long distance dispersal by winged morphs, and their explosive population dynamics. Attention has mainly been focused on invasive aphid pests of economic importance to agriculture, horticulture, and forestry. More recently, however, concerns have also concentrated on potential impacts of aphids on biodiversity, especially with respect to endangered native plants. Fungi are the most prevalent pathogens of aphids, and consequently fungi have been studied and used for biological control of invasive aphid species. Entomopathogenic fungi with high epizootic potential have been used in classical biological control programs, fungi have been mass produced and used for augmentation biological control (both inoculative and inundative), and crop and pest management practices have been modiﬁed to preserve/promote activity of naturally occurring fungi in conservation biological control programs. In this chapter we will review the various strategies that have been developed for control of invasive aphid species.

6.1 Introduction
Aphids (Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha: Aphididae) are small, usually 1.5–3.5 mm, soft-bodied, phloem-feeding insects. Worldwide more than 4000 aphid species have been described (Dixon 1998). Aphids are one of the most economically important groups of insect pests and, while they are more signiﬁcant in temperate climates, they can also cause substantial damage in the tropics. Their life cycles are diverse and complex, often including several morphs within the same species, and some species may have generations of individuals with high morphological variability. In some species, more than ten morphs may develop; including winged morphs

specialized for dispersal. In most cases, however, fewer morphs are required for completion of a life cycle (Heie 1980). Some species have sexually reproducing generations (holocyclic), while others do not reproduce sexually (anholocyclic) and consist only of viviparous parthenogenetic females.
In general, aphids have exceedingly short generation times due to their capacity for viviparous parthenogenetic reproduction and the fact that the offspring at birth contain embryos that also contain embryos (telescoping generations). Some holocyclic aphid species are dioecious, which means they exhibit host alternation between woody plants (the primary hosts, on which fertilised eggs hibernate and hatch in spring) and herbaceous plants (the secondary hosts or summer host). Other species are monoecious and do not alternate between hosts (Heie 1980, Dixon 1998).
Some aphid species are monophagous, having a very restricted plant host range. For example, the green spruce aphid, Elatobium abietinum (Walker), is an invasive aphid species in Iceland that feeds exclusively on trees in the genus Picea (spruce) (Blackman & Eastop 1994, Carter & Halldo´rsson 1998). In contrast, other aphid species are polyphagous, having much broader plant host ranges. One of the most polyphagous invasive aphids is the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover (also called the melon aphid), feeding on hosts from over 50 plant families (Blackman & Eastop 2000, Messing et al. 2007).
Aphids cause direct damage by sucking phloem sap and indirect damage by production of honeydew in which saprophytic fungi may grow. In addition, aphids can vector plant diseases with the potential to greatly increase crop losses (Minks & Harrewijn 1988). To date, most research on invasive aphids has focused on aphids as economic pests of agricultural, horticultural, and forestry crops. More recently, however, concerns have also concentrated on both the potential damage invasive aphids can inﬂict on native plants (especially endangered species) and their ecological effects on plant and insect communities (Teulon & Stufkens 2002, Messing et al. 2007, Andersen et al. 2008).
Colonization success of any invader is highly dependent on its ability to survive Allee effects (bottlenecks of a founder population). In the case of aphids the capacity for parthenogenesis and anholocycly lower the Allee population threshold considerably, making aphids more likely to establish in new areas (Mattson et al. 2007). Furthermore, these small insects can be very difﬁcult to detect and have the ability for long distance dispersal as winged morphs. Given these attributes and favorable circumstances (presence of host plants, absence of predators, and suitable weather), very few individuals need to be introduced to result in establishment (Dixon 1987, 1998). For these reasons, aphids account for a substantial proportion of introductions of exotic insects worldwide (Teulon & Stufkens 2002, Messing et al. 2007).
Aphids generally cannot survive for very long when not feeding on plants, and thus, successful invasions are most likely to result from introduction of reproductive females on their host plant. Alternatively, invasions may derive from eggs, as their small size and relatively long dormancy allows them to survive long periods without sustenance (Teulon & Stufkens 2002).
