The Rhinoceros Beetle Project in Western Samoa has developed and successfully applied biological methods to control the rhinoceros beetle, a serious pest of coconut palms, by using two specific pathogens, a baculovirus (Family Baculoviridae), and an entomopathogenic fungus, Metarhiziurn anisopliae. The application of virus particularly has markedly suppressed the beetle population and helped revive the copra industry. The virus disease had established itself in the wild beetle population several years after its introduction at a level between 30 and 50%. At the same time an increase in beetle numbers and damage to palm trees was experienced. Therefore, a continuous release of virus into beetle-infested areas was proposed. It was argued that, considering the relatively high level of “natural” virus incidence, further releases of virus into the population would be futile. In a combined research and control program, virus was again re-released into the wild beetle population which was already virus infected. The results show that through re-release the virus level can be raised and the number of beetles and consequently the damage can be reduced. The techniques of the control methods are described. The virus release is very easy and cheap: it requires no chemicals, no special equipment, and it is particularly recommended in situations where breeding places are inaccessible or other methods such as plantation sanitation are either impossible or economically impractical. Above all, the methods are absolutely safe from the standpoint of environmental protection.
KEY WORDS: Baculovirus; biological control of rhinoceros beetles; coconut pests: Oryctes rhinoceros: re-release of virus; viral control agents.

INTRODUCTION
The rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceYOS, Scarabaeidae) is the most serious pest of the coconut palm in the South Pacific. It was inadvertently introduced into Samoa from Sri Lanka in 1909 and from here it spread to many other islands in the region.
In the biological control against the rhinoceros beetle, the Rhinoceros Beetle Project in Western Samoa has successfully used two pathogens, a fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae, and a baculovirus of Oryctes (Family Baculoviridae: formerly Rhabdionvirus oryctes). The fungus was already

present, whereas the virus has been newly introduced.
The virus had been discovered in Malaysia in 1963 (Huger, 1966). The disease is
highly specific and only the genus Oryctes and a few closely related genera are susceptible. It affects and kills the larvae as
well as pupae and adult beetles. It is usually transmitted orally. The virus multiplies in the nuclei of the cells and thus the insects can be utilized to mass produce virus. A particular feature of the disease is the very
heavy tumor-like growth (hyperplasia) of virus-filled cells in the midgut of the adult beetle. This growth originates from virusinfected regenerative crypts and eventually tills the whole midgut with virus-filled cell nuclei. A gut filled with virus appears macroscopically as if it were filled with pus (Marschall, unpubl.). Since in the early stage the disease exclusively infects the

midgut without involving other organs, the beetles remain capable of flying and mating, although they produce plenty of virus in
their midgut and spread it through their feces wherever they fly. This enables us to use them to propagate the disease in the
field in an uncomplicated way. In 1967, the virus disease was introduced
into the field in Western Samoa for the first time. This was done by putting macerated Oryctes grubs which had been inoculated
with the virus, into heaps of rotten coconut wood (Marschall, 1970). This introductory
trial was to give an answer to three questions: (1) Is it possible to infect wild beetles easily? (2) Does the virus spread through the beetle population to distant and isolated
breeding and feeding areas? (3) Does the virus reduce the beetle population and consequently the damage? The results were clearly positive on all three points. Al-
though the application was still on a trial basis, the disease had not only spread from the three locations of release and established itself over the whole area of both islands of Western Samoa, but had already
exercised considerable control. In fact, it had brought about the first tangible reduc-
tion in damage and a revival of the copra industry. The most important benefit of the introduction of the virus, however, was the fact that for the first time replanting of coconut palm trees on a large scale could be done again, something which had been virtually impossible since the beetle landed in Samoa.
Because of these positive results, the virus was introduced with equal success to the Tokelaus (Marschall, unpubl.), Fiji (Satya Singh, unpubl.), Tonga (Young, unpubl.), Mauritius, the Seychelles, and recently into the Solomons and Papua-New
Guinea. The first drastic reduction in the numbers
of beetles and larvae, as well as in damage, was noticed from 1969 to 1970, after the initial epizootic had swept through the islands. From 1970 to 1975, however, practically no more virus was released in the field

in Western Samoa. After 1970, a decrease in virus incidence was noticed and again beetles were found in increasing numbers. During the same time also the damage to palm trees increased. A sharp increase in damage was observed in several outbreak areas where the clearing of bush or felling of large numbers of coconut trees had provided ample breeding facilities. From field collections of beetles and grubs (mostly from trapping) it appeared that a “natural” equilibrium between the virus level and the beetle population had established itself. The level was around 35 to 50% in trapped beetles and 8 to 10% in field-collected larvae. We have no indication that a rise in the beetle population is followed by a rise in virus level; experience seems to point rather in the opposite direction.
From these observations it was inferred that the level at which the virus disease had established itself under natural conditions was not sufficient to control the rhinoceros beetle, and that more virus had to be introduced artificially into the wild beetle population. As a result, when the Samoan-German Rhinoceros Beetle Project commenced in 1975, a program of virus re-release was undertaken. The objective of this program was to control the rhinoceros beetle in some of the worst outbreak areas, but it was also to furnish information on the effect of a rerelease of virus into a wild beetle population already virus infected.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
For the combined control and research program, six coconut plantations with moderate to heavy beetle damage were selected. No specific test-area dimensions were set, as coconut groves in Western Samoa are more or less contiguous, and the beetles fly over long distances.
For the monitoring of the virus in the field, the beetles were trapped or collected from crowns. A beetle trap consists of a tin 15 cm in diameter and 10 cm in height over which is placed a slice of coconut wood about 20 cm in diameter and 4-5 cm thick,

cutfrom a trunk, with a hole 2.5 cm wide in

the center. A specific beetle attractant,

ethylchrysanthemumate

(Rhinolure), is

dropped on the underside of the wooden

slice. The beetles of both sexes are at-

tracted by the scent, crawl through the

hole, and fall into the tin from which they

cannot escape. The whole contraption is

mounted on a wooden board and attached

with wire to the trunk of a coconut palm.

The traps were placed at the edge of the

coconut plantations at intervals of ap-

proximately 50 m. They were checked on

one certain day every week, the beetles

were removed, and fresh attractant was

applied at the same time.

For crown collections, the beetles were

picked out from between the emerging

fronds or poked out of their tunnels with a

wire hook. This procedure could only be

done in palm trees 5- 10 years old.

The collected beetles were put individu-

ally in glass tubes, taken to the laboratory,

and microscopical preparations were made

1 or 2 days later. The beetles were dis-

sected, a portion of the midgut epithelium

was squashed on a slide, and a smear pre-

pared, which was stained and observed

under the microscope. The presence of

virus infection reveals itself by the occur-

rence of the so-called ring zone in the nu-

cleus (Fig. 1). For virus release, the beetles

were inoculated orally with a virus suspen-

sion of a dosage of lop4 g of virus-infected

midgut substance per beetle. The virus was

obtained from heavily virus-infected mid-

guts of beetles which consist of almost pure

virus with cell fragments. The guts were

weighed and then macerated in a tissue

grinder with a calibrated amount of sugar

water. This suspension was dropped with a

calibrated pipette onto the mouths of the beetles which readily sucked it up. The in-

fected beetles were marked with a file on

their elytra. They were put in boxes sus-

pended from trees in the plantations from

where they flew away at night. Controls for

all releases were checked in the laboratory

for virus infection. The number of beetles

and dates of release are indicated in the figures.
Before each virus release, the beetle population was monitored for 3-6 months in four areas. A survey of beetle damage to palms was conducted (percentage of trees with the first five or six emerging fronds cut). Damage surveys were repeated every 6-9 months. In four plantations, beetles were only trapped: Vaipapa, 200 traps; Puipa’a, 90 traps, on Upolu; on Manono Island 100-200 traps; Lalomalava 150 traps, on Savai’i; In one area they were trapped and collected from crowns: Tausani, 140 traps, on Upolu; and in one area they were only collected from crowns: Afia, on Upolu, 200 palm trees were checked in each crown check. Damage surveys were conducted in Vaipapa, Ruipa’a, Lalomalava,3 and Tausani.
RESULTS
The results of the trap catches are presented in Figures 2-7.
To all appearances, the curves of the trap catches show no trend in any direction but seem to follow an irregular pattern.
In all areas there is a peak in beetle numbers each year during the drier season from May to August, and a low in numbers during the rainy season from December to April. This does not represent a fluctuation in the beetle population but rather indicates that the beetles are reluctant to fly to the traps in bad weather. The difference in catch numbers between the two seasons amounts to about 30% in Puipa’a and about 50% in the other areas.
In Manono (Fig. 4), a sharp drop from a peak in June 1977 is noticeable after a virus release, but the beetle population rises again after a year. In Vaipapa (Fig. 2) we observe the same fluctuation, but the curves show a correlation between low catch tigures and high virus incidence and vice versa. Only the beetle population in Lalomalava (Fig. 5) shows a tendency to-

ward a decline after the application of virus. This is accompanied by a decline in damage as well.
The relative virus incidence (Figs. 2-6, 8) shows even less of a tendency and bears no relationship to the releases or to the seasons. The level of the disease moves irregularly up and down in the range between 30 and 50%, except for a few extremely

high or low figures. In Lalomalava, the most successful trial area, judging from the reduction in damage, the level of virus incidence among trapped beetles even drops.
The damage to palm trees in Vaipapa (Fig. 2) first drops slightly, then rises again. This is a typical outbreak area where prior to the trial the palm trees had come under sudden heavy attacks by beetles. The virus

re-release seemed to have halted these attacks, but when no more virus-infected beetles were released, the damage increased again. In contrast, in Lalomalava (Fig. 5) with continuous virus re-release, the damage shows a steady decline from 75 to 2% over a period of 1 year.

Figure 7 represents the data from crown
collections in Alia. In these instances the figures differ essentially from the trapping figures and one notes a clear tendency: right after the re-release of virus the number of beetles collected declines sharply and continues to do so. It drops to 50%

after about 2 months. The last collection of beetles, 8 months after the first re-release, yields only less than 5% of what it was before. Unfortunately, in Tausani (Fig. 6, trapping), we caught few beetles to begin with, but the figures follow the same pattern as in the Afia trial.
At the same time the level of the virus disease rises considerably (from 54 to 83%

in Afia). It does not go up and down but remains high. We observe a correlation between increasing virus level and decreasing beetle numbers. Even though in the last catch of the Afia trial the virus level drops, that is understandable if one considers the small number of only four beetles from 200 palm trees.

catches, the figures of beetle numbers and virus incidence from trap catches in Tausani (Fig. 6) during the same time follow an irregular pattern as in the other trapping areas.
At the same time, the damage to palm trees decreases slightly. It may be noted that the trees in Afia suffered from continuous heavy attacks by beetles over many years.
In Figure 8 the relative virus incidences in trap catches and crown catches from four areas over the same period are compared. Whereas the trap catches remain in a band between 25 and 50% irrespective of virus release, the crown catches rise after the application of virus and remain high.
DISCUSSION
From the scientific point of view it would have been desirable to have an untreated control area for comparison. However, this was impossible since we had to depend on the plantation owners for support in material and labor and no one could be asked to

leave his plantation untreated without financial compensation. However, the area in Vaipapa where no virus beetles were released for more than 1.5 years may be considered a control area.
As for possible repercussions on the beetle numbers due to the taking of beetles from the field for dissection, it is a known fact that trapping or collecting from crowns does not reduce the numbers of the beetle population as a whole to an appreciable degree, even after extensive trapping or collecting. Moreover, beetles usually do not stay more than 3-6 days in one crown but are constantly on the move. This is corroborated by hand-picking of rhinoceros beetles in young oil palm plantations in Malaysia. The method gave a certain protection to the palms but had no noticeable effect on the beetle population. Trapping without other control measures showed in several instances no effect on the beetle numbers. For these reasons the effect of trapping and collecting beetles in the context of the experiments described here can

be neglected. The change in beetle numbers is therefore attributed to the effect of the re-release of virus-infected beetles.
It should be remembered that the beetles, despite their destructive characteristics, occur only in relatively small numbers. A few beetles (about one beetle per three to five palm trees) are capable of inflicting heavy damage. Thirty to forty beetles from 150 traps per week is a very good catch. Also, we have no control over the movements of the beetles once they are released. We know, however, that released beetles first fly to the palm trees and only after having fed they come to the traps (Sabatini, 1979). This explains the very low rate of recapture of released beetles. Sabatini’s investigations revealed further that in trap catches there is no bias as to sex, age, or physiological stage of the beetles, i.e., we catch a cross section of the whole population. However, virus-infected beetles are less likely to be caught in traps than healthy ones. So, in regard to the level of the disease, the trap catches are not representative. This explains why the curves of the

virus percentages bear no relationship to the releases.
Male beetles are found to have a higher virus incidence than females, about lo20% more in trap catches. Therefore, if a population is affected by the disease, fewer males than females are caught in traps. This was demonstrated very clearly by Bedford et al. (1975) on the small island of Vomo, Fiji, where they had trapped beetles. Before virus got into the population, the percentage of trapped males was 58.7%; when this changed to 32.2%, virus was discovered in the population.
In Figure 9 the percentages of males from different sources are compared. In the mass rearing (as well as in field collections), we find almost equal numbers of females and males (males 46.4%). If we add up the total of all crown catches, we also find nearly equal numbers of the sexes: in Afia 41.9% males, and in Tausani 44.9% males. The same applies to Vomo trap catches before the virus appeared (58.7% males). Quite in contrast, in virus-infected areas the percentages of males in traps (all catches

lower, namely 32.2% in Vomo, 27.4% in

Vaipapa, 24.2% in Puipa’a, 19.5% in Man-

ono, and 17.3% in Lalomalava. In the area

with the strongest reduction in damage,

Lalomalava, we counted the lowest relative

number of males. That suggests that the

proportion of males in traps is a better indi-

cator of the disease level and of the effect of

the re-release than the virus incidence in

trapped beetles.

With males and females being equally

frequent in crowns, those figures for virus

incidence are more likely to be representa-

tive and consequently rise after new application of virus.

From early 1970 to 1975 practically no

virus was released in Samoa. It was argued

that re-release of virus into an already con-

taminated wild population would be futile

since even the largest possible numbers of

infected beetles which could be treated

would make but an insignificant addition to

the already existing virus level and would

therefore be worthless. The results present-

ed here show that the level of virus can be

substantially raised and the beetle popula-

tion reduced by releasing even small num-

bers of infected beetles. After the re-release

of virus into outbreak areas the damage to

palm trees decreased.

.

From those facts the following conclu-

sions are drawn: (1) The virus disease, if

left alone at its natural level, does not con-

trol the beetle population sufficiently. Experiences from countries with indigenous virus infestation of rhinoceros beetles corroborate this observation. (2) It is possible to increase through re-release of virus-infected beetles the level of virus infection in the wild beetle population and to reduce the number of beetles and subsequently the damage.
