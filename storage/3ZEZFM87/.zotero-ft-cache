Abstract
BACKGROUND: Although portable harmonic radar system and Ô¨Çuorescent marking system are two widely used detection methods, their comparative eÔ¨Äectiveness has not been studied. Therefore, we Ô¨Årst tested the applicability of Ô¨Çuorescent marking system on Riptortus pedestris (Hemiptera: Alydidae). Then, we evaluated the eÔ¨Écacy of the two methods used either alone or combined in a grass Ô¨Åeld and bean Ô¨Åeld, varying with complexity, during day and night.
RESULTS: Fluorescent marking did not aÔ¨Äect the behavior or Ô¨Åtness of Riptortus pedestris except for vertical walking, while allowing the detection from >25 m when paired with a handheld laser. Generally, the portable harmonic radar system and both methods combined were more successful in sample detection, although the Ô¨Çuorescent marking system in the bean Ô¨Åeld at night was as competitive as the two. Combining both methods made sample retrieval easier at night than the portable harmonic radar system. Nevertheless, the total detection time showed a large variance across the methods.
CONCLUSION: The portable harmonic radar system can be an eÔ¨Äective detection method in either landscape during both day and night. Furthermore, the Ô¨Çuorescent marking system can be a reliable tool at night as well. Lastly, combining both methods can improve the night detection. ¬© 2018 Society of Chemical Industry

1 INTRODUCTION
Field tracking of an organism can provide valuable information on the life history and the behavior of the target in natural settings.1‚Äì3 Two of the key components that determine the eÔ¨Écacy of detection methods are conspicuousness of the marker on target and the eÔ¨Äect of detection technique application on the organism.4 Tracking of large vertebrate organisms has been studied using various tracking methods including radar tracking devices, bands, brands and tags.5,6 However, smaller organisms including insects and other invertebrates require a more delicate tracking method than vertebrates because their behavior and physiology can easily be altered by the marker and tags.7‚Äì10 For example, Kim et al.10 observed a signiÔ¨Åcant change in the Ô¨Çight behavior of Ricania sp. (Hemiptera: Ricaniidae) and Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) due to a radar tag attachment although the same tag did not aÔ¨Äect the Ô¨Çight behavior of Riptortus pedestris (Hemiptera: Alydidae), Lycorma delicatula (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae), and Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera: Apidae). Furthermore, the small size of the organisms makes visual detection more challenging.11 Radar system9,12 and Ô¨Çuorescent marking13,14 are generally used to detect insects or other invertebrates4 among the numerous insect detection methods such as mutilation marking,15 paint and ink marking,16,17 genetic marking,18,19 and elemental marking.20,21

Harmonic radar system has been demonstrated as a useful tool to track terrestrial insects.1,2,22 Conventional radio transponders require batteries to operate, increasing its weight and the loading on the target insects thereby limiting the application only to larger insects.9 For example, tags used by Hedin and Ranius23 weighed at least 0.48 g, taking up to 20‚Äì25% of the body weight of Osmoderma eremita (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae), a large beetle that weighs 2.2 g for females and 2.4 g for males. Boiteau and Colpitts8 demonstrated that the Ô¨Çight of Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) which weighs 117 mg might be altered if the weight of the tag exceeded 2.4% of its body weight.8 However, the tag of the harmonic radar system does not require a battery to operate, leading to minimal loading on the target; Roland et al.7 were able to reduce the weight of the tag down to 0.4 mg.2,22,24 A transponder attached to a target organism utilizes the signal from the radar as its energy source, amplifying the frequency to a harmonic frequency and re-emitting it.25,26 Indeed,

Portable harmonic radar system and Ô¨Çuorescent marking system

www.soci.org

a portable version of the harmonic radar, harmonic direction Ô¨Ånder, has been recently used to study various insects such as terrestrial beetles and hemipteran insects.9,24,27‚Äì29 Although it has a shorter range than conventional harmonic radar and only gives the direction without the implication of the location of the tagged individual, it is more aÔ¨Äordable and accessible, allowing the portable device to be applicable in various landscapes.9,30
Fluorescent marking has been used to observe and study the behavior and dispersal of a large number of insects such as mosquitoes and bees because it is easy to access and apply to large groups of insects.4,14,31 Traditional pairing of Ô¨Çuorescent marking with ultraviolet (UV) lamps is labor-intensive and ineÔ¨Écient when target animals have high mobility due to its short range of illumination.13,32 Recently, Rice et al.33 suggested the use of a handheld laser which enabled detection of Ô¨Çuorescent-marked Halyomorpha halys (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) located 40 m away while creating a 1-m diameter Ô¨Åeld of detection. With its increased range of detection, this new Ô¨Çuorescent marking system allows the researchers to quickly scan larger areas and hence, increasing the potential to be an eÔ¨Äective insect detection method.
Although both the portable harmonic radar system and Ô¨Çuorescent marking are widely used detection methods, eÔ¨Äectiveness of the techniques may vary in diÔ¨Äerent settings.4,12,14,27,34 Harmonic direction Ô¨Ånder allows remote sensing of tagged individuals behind obstacles such as soil or vegetation.27 However, as mentioned earlier, the operator is not able to locate the tagged individuals just with the signal from the device because it can only give the direction of the target.30,35 Furthermore, the eÔ¨Äectiveness of the devices reduces in the presence of water or metal.36 Though, a handheld laser makes Ô¨Çuorescent-marked individual conspicuous, making the detection intrinsic and eÔ¨Écient.13,33 However, only the marked object in an unobstructed line of sight can be detected by UV-light source. Also, the eÔ¨Écacy of UV lamps or handheld lasers decreases immensely under bright light.13
In our study, we assessed the detection eÔ¨Écacy of the portable harmonic radar system and Ô¨Çuorescent marking paired with a handheld laser on a small agricultural insect pest, Riptortus pedestris. This insect is a major crop pest in East Asia, causing severe economic damage on multiple leguminous crops, gramineous crops, and fruit trees.37‚Äì39 According to anecdotal evidence, Riptortus pedestris may actively seek host plants and avoid chemical pesticides, implying the need for the understanding of its dispersal capacity and pattern to enhance management tactics.40 The insect is 16 mm long41 and weighs 41 mg.10 Previous studies have demonstrated that attachment of 9 mm long harmonic radar tags that weigh 3 mg does not have a signiÔ¨Åcant eÔ¨Äect on the longevity, vertical mobility and Ô¨Çight capacity of Riptortus pedestris, suggesting its potential in studying the population dynamics of the insect.10,40 However, how Riptortus pedestris may be aÔ¨Äected by Ô¨Çuorescent marking is still yet to be understood. Therefore, we Ô¨Årst investigated the eÔ¨Äect of Ô¨Çuorescent dye on behavior (feeding, walking and Ô¨Çight) and Ô¨Åtness (longevity and fecundity) of adult Riptortus pedestris to ensure that it does not adversely aÔ¨Äect the organism.4,42 Furthermore, we measured the detection distance of Ô¨Çuorescent-marked Riptortus pedestris to validate if harmless levels of Ô¨Çuorescent marking is viable in insect detection. Finally, we assessed the detection eÔ¨Écacy of each method for both day and night to test the eÔ¨Äectiveness of the methods under diÔ¨Äerent light level. We also assessed if using both methods can improve the detection compared to using either method alone. Because a handheld laser can make Ô¨Çuorescent-marked individuals more conspicuous, we assumed

that it can assist harmonic direction Ô¨Ånder in locating the tagged object especially at night. The experiment was conducted in two agricultural landscapes varying with complexity and obstructiveness, grass Ô¨Åeld and bean Ô¨Åeld, both of which are potential habitats of Riptortus pedestris.
2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Insect Adult Riptortus pedestris individuals used in the experiment were obtained from a laboratory colony collected from wooded areas in Gachon University, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea (37‚àò 27‚Ä≤ 2.44‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ N 127‚àò 7‚Ä≤ 50.74‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ E) using aggregation pheromone traps (Green-Agrotech Co. Ltd, Gyeongsangbuk-do, South Korea). Insects were kept inside of mesh cages (BugDorm-4, MegaView Science Education Services Co., Ltd, Taiwan) and provided with dried soybeans and distilled water containing 0.05% ascorbic acid at 25 ¬± 2 ‚àòC, 30% ¬± 10% relative humidity (RH) with a photoperiod of 16 h:8 h light:dark. Second instar nymphs of Riptortus pedesris was supplied with Burkholderia strains (RPE 75),43 a gut symbiont of Riptortus pedestris which is known to enhance the Ô¨Åtness of the insect.41,44
2.2 Portable harmonic radar system For the portable harmonic radar system, a harmonic direction Ô¨Ånder manufactured by B. Colpitts and his laboratory at the University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada was used for the experiment. The harmonic direction Ô¨Ånder (ca. 10 kg) transmits 9.41 GHz signal which is absorbed and re-emitted in a harmonic frequency by a dipole radar tag (ca. 3 mg) that consists of a 9 mm long and 0.3 mm diameter copper wire and a transponder (Schottky diode ‚Äì Agilent HSCH-5340, Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). The tag has a 1 mm diameter loop and is bent to 90‚àò at the bottom for the convenience of attachment to the insect. Detailed information on the harmonic direction Ô¨Ånder and the tags can be obtained from Boiteau et al.45 and Lee et al.29 When we tagged the insect sample, the pronotum of adult Riptortus pedestris was carefully sanded Ô¨Årst, and a droplet of cyanoacrylate glue (Loctite 401 Prism Instant Adhesive, Henkel Corporation, Rocky Hill, CT, USA) was applied to ensure a solid attachment.10,40
2.3 Fluorescent marking system For Ô¨Çuorescent marking on Riptortus pedestris, red Ô¨Çuorescent paint (Luminous Paint Red 4 Oz, 1166R, BioQuip Products, Rancho Dominguez, CA, USA) was diluted with equal volume of distilled water. Then, the paint solution was sprayed thoroughly on the insect for approximately 2 s (10 mg) using airbrush kit (BBM-001 Beetle Bug Mini Package, YAMATO COMP, Seoul, South Korea). Furthermore, when the insect needed to be both Ô¨Çuorescent-marked and radar-tagged, the insect was Ô¨Årst Ô¨Çuorescent-marked and given an hour for the paint to dry before radar tag attachment. A handheld laser (PX 600 mW, class IIIB purple laser, 405 nm, Big Lasers, New York, NY, USA), introduced by Rice et al.,33 was used for the detection of Ô¨Çuorescent-marked insects (Fig. 1).
2.4 Assessment of survivorship, feeding activity, and fecundity The potential impact of Ô¨Çuorescent marking on survivorship was assessed for 30 unmarked and 30 marked insect groups each consisting 15 males and 15 females in a laboratory experiment. Each individual was placed in a transparent plastic cup [10.5 cm √ó 9.0 cm

(diameter √ó height)] and provided with two dried soybeans and a cotton ball soaked with distilled water containing 0.05% ascorbic acid in a 40 mm petri dish at 25 ¬± 1 ‚àòC and 45% ¬± 5% RH. Survival of each insect was checked every 12 h over seven days. In the same experiment, we examined the total number of stylet sheaths left on dried soybeans, which is often employed as a measure of feeding activity for hemipteran insects.46,47 To dye the soybeans, we Ô¨Årst soaked each soybean in lactophenol blue solution containing fuchsine acid and distilled water (1:1:1). Lastly, the fecundity of female Riptortus pedestris was evaluated by counting the total number of eggs laid inside of each plastic cup after the seven days of observation period; when nymphs already hatched from the eggs, we included the number of empty shells when measuring the fecundity.
2.5 Assessment of walking and Ô¨Çight ability The potential eÔ¨Äect of Ô¨Çuorescent marking on two mobility parameters, vertical walking and Ô¨Çight abilities were evaluated. First, the vertical walking of untreated control and Ô¨Çuorescent-marked Riptortus pedestris consisting 15 males and 15 females each was evaluated under laboratory conditions at 25 ¬± 2 ‚àòC and 40% ¬± 10% RH. Each group was prepared a day before and provided with dried soybeans and distilled water containing 0.05% ascorbic acid in a 40 mm petri dish. At the onset of each trial, an adult Riptortus pedestris was randomly selected and placed inside the bottom of a transparent polycarbonate cylinder [6 cm √ó 36 cm (diameter √ó height)] with wire mesh attached to the inner surface and subsequently evaluated for its vertical walking distance over 5 min.46 When the insect reached the 30 cm mark at the top, the recorder reversed the cylinder, so that the adults could continue moving upwards.

Second, the potential inÔ¨Çuence of Ô¨Çuorescent marking on Riptortus pedestris Ô¨Çight behavior was evaluated under Ô¨Åeld conditions. The experiment was conducted at a soccer Ô¨Åeld of Gachon University, Seongnam-sii, South Korea from 15:00 to 17:15 h (sunrise at 05:44 h and sunset at 19:30 h) at 33 ¬± 2 ‚àòC and 50% ¬± 10% RH. The experiment was conducted with 30 untreated control and 30 Ô¨Çuorescent-marked individuals, after three individuals from each group, which failed to take oÔ¨Ä within the Ô¨Årst 5 min were excluded. Tested insects were prepared the day before with same method as the individuals from vertical walking evaluation. When the experiment started, the recorder placed adult Riptortus pedestris at the top of a Dead-Inn Pyramid Trap (AgBio Development Inc., Westminster, CO, USA) [49.0 cm √ó 108.8 cm (base √ó height)] which was set at the center of the soccer Ô¨Åeld. When adult Riptortus pedestris initiated Ô¨Çight within 5 min, time until takeoÔ¨Ä, Ô¨Çight direction and whether adults made over 30 m of sustained Ô¨Çight were recorded.
2.6 Detection distance of Ô¨Çuorescent marking system To assess the potential of the Ô¨Çuorescent marking system on Riptortus pedestris, maximum detection distance of Ô¨Çuorescent-marked individuals was measured in an indoor gym at Gachon University under dark. Two Dead-Inn Pyramid Traps were placed 3 m apart. Each trap was vertically divided into three even sections. A recorder pinned a marked insect on random one of six sections. An operator with a handheld laser stood 30 m away from the center of the two traps. Once the experiment started, the operator aimed the laser to the traps and scanned them carefully. If the operator could not spot the marked insect, the operator moved 1 m towards the traps until the location of the marked insect was correctly identiÔ¨Åed. The distance from the marked insect to the operator was recorded. Three operators participated

in the experiment and it was replicated 30 times with batteries changed after every Ô¨Åve replications.

2.7 Detection eÔ¨Écacy
The eÔ¨Écacy of three detection methods, the portable harmonic radar system, the Ô¨Çuorescent marking system and both methods combined was assessed in two diÔ¨Äerent landscapes varying with visual obstructiveness. In each landscape, the eÔ¨Äect of light availability (day or night) on the detection eÔ¨Écacy was evaluated. The Ô¨Årst landscape chosen was a grass Ô¨Åeld [25 m √ó 10 m (width √ó height)] with grass approximately 10 cm tall in Gachon University (37‚àò 27‚Ä≤ 2.44‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ N 127‚àò 7‚Ä≤ 50.74‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ E). The second landscape chosen was a right-triangle-shaped bean Ô¨Åeld [28 m √ó 18 m (base √ó height)] in Mugap-ri, Chowul-up, Gwangju-si, South Korea (37‚àò 25‚Ä≤ 27.11‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ N 127‚àò 19‚Ä≤ 40.48‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ E). The bean plants were 0.5‚Äì1 m tall and at R6‚ÄìR7 growth stage.
The experiment was conducted as follows. Starting from a Ô¨Åxed position for each landscape, an operator attempted to detect a hidden adult Riptortus pedestris sample in the arena using either one of three methods. For the portable harmonic radar system, the operator searched for a radar-tagged Riptortus pedestris using a harmonic direction Ô¨Ånder. During the night experiment, the operator was assisted with a handheld Ô¨Çashlight. For the Ô¨Çuorescent marking system, the operator used a handheld laser to locate Ô¨Çuorescent-marked samples. Finally, when using both methods, the operator Ô¨Årst sought a radar-tagged and Ô¨Çuorescent-marked sample using a harmonic direction Ô¨Ånder. Then, after the device recognized a signal from the sample, the operator used a laser to detect the insect.
In each trial, a recorder randomly placed an insect sample inside of the experimental arena. In the grass Ô¨Åeld, the insect was pinned on the ground whereas it was pinned on the adaxial surface of bean plant in the Ô¨Åeld. Whether the operator successfully retrieved the insect sample within 10 min and the time until the detection were recorded. Finally, when using the portable harmonic radar system or both combined, the operator notiÔ¨Åed the recorder when the operator recognized a positive signal (signal detection) for the Ô¨Årst time. The experiment was replicated 30 times each in diÔ¨Äerent landscape for both during day and night for all three detection methods. The day experiment was conducted after sunrise (06:45‚Äì07:00 h) between 10:00 and 16:00 h. For the night experiment, the trial was conducted past sunset (17:30‚Äì17:55 h), between 19:00 and 23:00 h to minimize the level of light. From the experiment, the detection rate, total detection time and time delay (the time between signal detection by the harmonic direction Ô¨Ånder to sample retrieval) were obtained to analyze the eÔ¨Écacy of the detection method.

2.8 Data analysis

EÔ¨Äect of Ô¨Çuorescent marking on Riptortus pedestris was Ô¨Årst ana-

lyzed by comparing the performances of untreated control and

Ô¨Çuorescent-marked group. The survivorship, proportion of suc-

cessful Ô¨Çights and Ô¨Çight directions of the two groups were ana-

lyzed using Pearson‚Äôs chi-square test. However, feeding activity,

fecundity of the females, vertical walking, and the time until take-

oÔ¨Ä were compared between the two groups using a two-tailed t-test with Ì†µÌªº level set at 0.05. For the results with non-signiÔ¨Åcant dif-

ferences, we retrospectively calculated the minimum diÔ¨Äerences

which could have been detected using t-test with the following

equation48:

where D is the minimum diÔ¨Äerence between the performance means of the untreated control and Ô¨Çuorescent-marked groups, t is a t-value for each corresponding degrees of freedom at Ì†µÌªº = 0.05, and SE1 and SE2 are the standard errors for the untreated control and Ô¨Çuorescent-marked groups respectively.
The detection rate, total detection time and time delay were analyzed to assess the eÔ¨Écacy of each detection method at diÔ¨Äerent settings. For the detection rate, a nominal logistic regression was used to investigate the individual and interactive eÔ¨Äects of three Ô¨Åxed factors: (i) the landscape (grass Ô¨Åeld versus bean Ô¨Åeld), (ii) time of experiment (day versus night), and (iii) detection method (portable harmonic radar system, Ô¨Çuorescent marking system versus both methods combined). For the total detection time, a general linear model was used to assess the signiÔ¨Åcance of the three factors as well as the interaction among the three. Additionally, we assessed if the Ô¨Çuorescent marking system can improve the portable harmonic radar system when used together; we evaluated if the time delay can be reduced when the two methods were combined compared to using only the harmonic radar system. The eÔ¨Äect of the three factors and the interactive eÔ¨Äects among them were analyzed using a general linear model. Then, the detection rate and total detection time were evaluated across detection methods using analysis of variance (ANOVA) whereas the time delay was compared using t-test for each setting (landscape and time of experiment). All the statistical analysis were executed using JMP software (JMP¬Æ, Version 12. SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, 1989‚Äì2007).
3 RESULTS
3.1 Assessment of survivorship, feeding activity, and fecundity The survivorship of Riptortus pedestris adults did not signiÔ¨Åcantly diÔ¨Äer between the untreated control and Ô¨Çuorescent-marked groups (Table 1). For the feeding activity, there was no signiÔ¨Åcant diÔ¨Äerence in the number of stylet sheathes remaining on the soybeans between the two groups (Table 1). In addition, the fecundity of Riptortus pedestris female was not signiÔ¨Åcantly aÔ¨Äected by Ô¨Çuorescent marking (Table 1). Retrospective analyses showed that the diÔ¨Äerences in the means that could have been detected by t-test were 4.0 and 15.8 for feeding activity and fecundity respectively.
3.2 Assessment of walking and Ô¨Çight ability The vertical walking of Riptortus pedestris was signiÔ¨Åcantly increased in the Ô¨Çuorescent-marked group compared to untreated control (t = 3.55, df = 1, P < 0.05) (Table 1). However, the Ô¨Çight ability was not aÔ¨Äected by Ô¨Çuorescent marking; neither the time until takeoÔ¨Ä nor the number of individuals which successfully made a 30-m sustained Ô¨Çight was signiÔ¨Åcantly diÔ¨Äerent between the two groups (Table 1). The minimum diÔ¨Äerence to be detected for the time until takeoÔ¨Ä was 14.2 s. When the Ô¨Çight directions of all the insects that took oÔ¨Ä were compared between the two groups, the Ô¨Çight direction of Ô¨Çuorescent-marked Riptortus pedestris leaned towards west, whereas prevailing Ô¨Çight direction of the untreated control group was along the northwest and southeast axis (Fig. 2). However, no statistical diÔ¨Äerence was observed between the two groups (Ì†µÌºí2 = 11.33, df = 7, P = 0.12).
3.3 Detection distance of Ô¨Çuorescent marking system The mean detection distance of Ô¨Çuorescent-marked Riptortus pedestris individuals (distance between operator and marked insect) was 27.1 ¬± 1.2 m [mean ¬± standard error (SE)] (Fig. 3).

Overall, the detection distance became longer as the trials had progressed suggesting that operators might have become more eÔ¨Äective in Ô¨Ånding the marked target over the duration of experiment.
3.4 Detection eÔ¨Écacy Regression analyses were used to evaluate whether the three factors (landscape, time of experiment, and detection method) aÔ¨Äected the detection eÔ¨Écacy to Ô¨Ånd marked insects (detection rate, total detection time, and time delay). First, the detection rate was signiÔ¨Åcantly aÔ¨Äected by all three Ô¨Åxed factors (P < 0.05) (Table 2), whereas none of their interaction terms were signiÔ¨Åcant. Especially for the detection method, the detection rate of the Ô¨Çuorescent marking system was signiÔ¨Åcantly lower compared to either the portable harmonic radar system (odds ratio = 400.50, P < 0.05) or both methods combined (odds ratio = 390.65, P < 0.05). However, the detection rates of the other two detection methods did not diÔ¨Äer signiÔ¨Åcantly (odds ratio = 0.97, P = 1.00). Likewise, the three Ô¨Åxed factors signiÔ¨Åcantly aÔ¨Äected the total detection time (P < 0.05) (Table 3), but their interaction terms did not. Especially, only the total detection time of combined methods did not differ with either of the methods (Tukey‚Äôs HSD, P < 0.05). For the time delay (the time between signal detection by the harmonic

direction Ô¨Ånder to visual detection of the insect sample), the detection methods signiÔ¨Åcantly aÔ¨Äected the period between the signal detection and sample retrieval (P < 0.05) (Table 3), but neither landscape nor time of experiment did. Among the interaction terms of the three factors, the interaction between time of experiment and detection method was signiÔ¨Åcant (P < 0.05) (Table 3).
We further compared the detection eÔ¨Écacy across the detection methods tested for each setting, which consists of the landscape and time of experiment. In the grass Ô¨Åeld, the Ô¨Çuorescent marking system yielded the lowest detection rate compared to the portable harmonic radar system or both methods combined, regardless of time of experiment (day: Ì†µÌºí2 = 37.43, df = 2, P < 0.05; night: Ì†µÌºí2 = 15.18, df = 2, P < 0.05) (Fig. 4(A)). In the bean Ô¨Åeld, the results were similar to the grass Ô¨Åeld during the day but they were not at night: the detection rate was lowest with the Ô¨Çuorescent marking system during the day (Ì†µÌºí2 = 29.20, df = 2, P < 0.05) whereas there was no signiÔ¨Åcant diÔ¨Äerence among the three methods at night (Ì†µÌºí2 = 1.58, df = 2, P = 0.46) (Fig. 4(B)). For the total detection time, there was no signiÔ¨Åcant diÔ¨Äerence among the three detection methods in all settings (Fig. 5). Lastly, the time delay signiÔ¨Åcantly diÔ¨Äered between the two detection methods tested only at night, regardless of the landscape (grass Ô¨Åeld: t = 2.25, df = 1, P < 0.05; bean Ô¨Åeld: t = 3.16, df = 1, P < 0.05) (Table 4).
4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Although Ô¨Çuorescent marking system has been employed when monitoring multiple insect species, Rice et al.33 were the Ô¨Årst to evaluate and demonstrate the potential of a handheld laser in detection of Ô¨Çuorescent-marked insects from a long distance.13,14,31 Nevertheless, although the results by Rice et al.33 suggest the eÔ¨Äectiveness of a handheld laser among the other detection devices on Ô¨Çuorescent-marked insects, whether the method was viable in detecting living insects, especially Riptortus pedestris, was not provided because the experiment was conducted with dead H. halys samples. The response of insects to chemicals may vary respective of the compounds and the application method,49 and likewise, the eÔ¨Äect of the Ô¨Çuorescent marking on a living organism varies with the species of the insect and the method used to mark the insect. However, the eÔ¨Äect of the spraying method on Riptortus pedestris was not tested previously. Therefore, our study Ô¨Årst tested the impact of Ô¨Çuorescent-marking on adult Riptortus pedestris and subsequently assessed its applicability.
In our experiment, although the vertical walking of Ô¨Çuorescent marked insects increased by an average of 2.5 times compared with the untreated control, Ô¨Çuorescent marking did not aÔ¨Äect the Ô¨Åtness (longevity and fecundity), feeding behavior, or Ô¨Çight ability of Riptortus pedestris. Tagging and marking may aÔ¨Äect the

the main method of dispersal for Ô¨Çying insects.8,50,51,53 Nevertheless, as our study shows, diverse aspects of insect mobility need to be considered with regards to how they may aÔ¨Äect the dispersal. Furthermore, when such inÔ¨Çuence is discovered, a proper adjustment and calibration compared to untreated control are necessary to properly interpret the results.
In addition, our retrospective analyses demonstrated that even the non-signiÔ¨Åcant data may need to be interpreted with caution. First, the t-test might have not been able to detect the diÔ¨Äerence in the fecundity of the two treatments due to the low sample size. Because only the females that reproduced were used in the statistical analysis, fecundity assessment had relatively smaller sample size than other assessments did. Nevertheless, even with a larger sample size, variation within treatments might have yielded the non-signiÔ¨Åcant results; especially, the mean time until takeoÔ¨Ä of the Ô¨Çuorescent-marked group was two times smaller than that of the control group. Indeed, it is not uncommon to observe

such large variations in behavioral assessments of insects.29,45,54 However, the number of Riptortus pedestris that successfully made a 30-m sustained Ô¨Çight was similar in the two groups, which suggests that Ô¨Çuorescent marking does not signiÔ¨Åcantly aÔ¨Äect the Ô¨Çight of the insect.
In our experiment, the detection distance of a marked insect with a handheld laser was approximately 27 m, but it kept increasing from initial 15 m until fourth trial from which it remained >25 m. This increase in detection distance can be attributed to the eÔ¨Äect of learning by the operators, suggesting that it can allow a more reliable and eÔ¨Äective detection of Ô¨Çuorescent-marked insects when used by trained personnel.
As the Ô¨Çuorescent marking system showed its viability in tracking of Riptortus pedestris, we then compared its eÔ¨Écacy with the portable harmonic radar system in two diÔ¨Äerent landscapes during day and night. It was previously demonstrated that the radar tag attachment does not negatively aÔ¨Äect adult Riptortus pedestris.10,40

a DiÔ¨Äerent letters indicate signiÔ¨Åcant diÔ¨Äerence between the two methods within time of experiments (P < 0.05).

In addition, we evaluated if combining two methods can enhance the detection eÔ¨Écacy.
In general, the detection rate was signiÔ¨Åcantly aÔ¨Äected by detection method as well as landscape and time of experiment. For the detection methods tested, the overall detection rate of using Ô¨Çuorescent marking system was signiÔ¨Åcantly lower than the portable harmonic radar system or both methods combined. This diÔ¨Äerence attributes to the fact that the detection rate of Ô¨Çuorescent marking was signiÔ¨Åcantly lower than the other two methods in all settings, except for the bean Ô¨Åeld experiment at night. For the landscapes tested, the overall detection rate was signiÔ¨Åcantly higher in the grass Ô¨Åeld compared to the bean Ô¨Åeld. Visual detection of the marked insect is required prior to the sample retrieval for all the detection methods used. In this study, the sample retrieval was more diÔ¨Écult in the bean Ô¨Åeld because bean plants created obstacles for line of visual detection. In addition, although the portable harmonic radar system can detect tagged objects behind plant materials,11 the detection eÔ¨Écacy can decrease in the presence of obstacles,55 which resulted in lower detection rate in the bean Ô¨Åeld.24,56,57 Lastly, the overall detection rate was signiÔ¨Åcantly lower during day than at night. This can be attributed in part to the low detection rates of Ô¨Çuorescent marking over daytime.13,58 Undoubtedly, sunlight makes it diÔ¨Écult to locate laser illumination reÔ¨Çected from Ô¨Çuorescent-marked insect, resulting in substantially lower detection rates by the Ô¨Çuorescent marking system during daytime. However, it is also noteworthy that the detection rate substantially was enhanced at night regardless of landscapes to the level that there was no signiÔ¨Åcant diÔ¨Äerence among the three methods at night in the bean Ô¨Åeld, a more complex landscape. Finally, there was no evidence supporting that combining the two methods signiÔ¨Åcantly increased the detection rate compared to when the portable harmonic radar system is used alone. However, the use of both methods combined contributed to easier sample retrieval of marked insects at night compared to the use of radar system alone. In our experiment, the combined use reduced the time between signal detection and retrieval of the sample by more than 50% at night. This enhancement was not observed during the daytime experiment.
In general, the total detection time was aÔ¨Äected by the three factors tested with a similar pattern to the results of the detection rate. Overall, the Ô¨Çuorescent marking system yielded the longest amount of time for Ô¨Ånal detection of marked insects; the diÔ¨Äerence was signiÔ¨Åcant compared to using the radar system alone whereas it was not signiÔ¨Åcant with the both methods combined. However, there was no signiÔ¨Åcant diÔ¨Äerence in the total detection time

across the three detection methods in any cases when it was compared in each landscape and time of experiment. This was in part due to large variations in the data within method. These variations are thought to be the results of handling of the devices by the operators. Because a thorough and systemic search is required when operating the harmonic direction Ô¨Ånder or laser, the level of training can aÔ¨Äect the eÔ¨Éciency of the detection.
To our knowledge, our experiment was the Ô¨Årst to (i) demonstrate the feasibility of using the Ô¨Çuorescent marking system in detecting Riptortus pedestris, and (ii) compare the eÔ¨Écacy of the portable harmonic radar system, Ô¨Çuorescent marking system, and the combined use in detecting marked insects. Our results provide fundamental information which allows a more eÔ¨Écient and reliable detection of marked insects in the Ô¨Åeld conditions. First, the Ô¨Çuorescent marking did not negatively aÔ¨Äect the Ô¨Åtness and behavior of adult Riptortus pedestris; however, caution is still warranted because the application of Ô¨Çuorescent paint elevated the insect‚Äôs walking distance in this experiment. In addition, the Ô¨Çuorescent marking on Riptortus pedestris was distinguishable and easily detected ca. 20 m away at night, suggesting its great potential as a night time detection tool. It is noteworthy the cost required for the Ô¨Çuorescent marking system (ca. $260) is substantially lower compared to the harmonic radar system (ca. $40 000). Moreover, the training required to operate the Ô¨Çuorescent marking system is much easier, and it is more accessible in the market. To our knowledge, no study has reported the viability of using the radar system at night. Interestingly, our results demonstrate that the detection rate of the portable harmonic radar system was not compromised even when light was lacking, compared to using the system under daylight. Furthermore, combining the Ô¨Çuorescent marking system to the radar operation at night conferred more eÔ¨Écient detection of marked insects. Therefore, combining both methods would allow the visual detection of target insect at night in a more eÔ¨Écient manner.
To conclude, our study demonstrates that the portable harmonic radar system can serve as a reliable detection tool during both day and night, and its eÔ¨Écacy can be enhanced with the aid of Ô¨Çuorescent marking system at night. As expected, the Ô¨Çuorescent marking was not viable during daytime but it can be operated reliably and eÔ¨Éciently at night, especially in a complex landscape such as a bean Ô¨Åeld. Even with a substantial increase in crop damage by Riptortus pedestris, dispersal capacity and patterns of Riptortus pedestrs are largely unknown. Therefore, the detection methods tested in this study can be a useful addition to conventional monitoring tools such as pheromone traps.
