Mark-Release-Recapture
1. Trapped beetles are fed and allowed to rest for one week 2. Beetles which pass a laboratory ﬂight test are marked
with a number 3. Marked beetles are released at the center of 31 pan
traps spaced 100m apart 4. About 20% of beetles have been recaptured 5. If wild beetles behave the same as marked beetles, we
can infer that pan traps catch about 20% of the wild population

Conclusions
1. Mass trapping using standard vaned-bucket pheromone traps did not result in population suppression. These traps catch only about 1% of the adult population.
2. Our best pheromone trap is a pan trap equiipped with cone and UVLED. It catches about 16X more rhino beetles per day than our standard vaned bucket traps.
3. Addition of breeding site material to the barrels did not increase trap catch.
4. Covering breeding sites with ﬁsh netting may be eﬀective for population suppression: traps adults attracted to the pile and prevents emergence of adults from within the pile. Netted piles catch more than 25X more rhino beetles per day than standard pheromone traps.
