Roland Quitugua, Guam Invasive Species Council member who is a board member of the Guam Northern Soil and Water Conservation District, says government agencies should work together to make sure invasive species don't cause further harm to Guam. John I. Borja/PDN

The Guam Invasive Species Council has created an ad hoc committee to focus on the management of green waste.

Green waste — including dead trees, decaying vegetation and cuttings — is “a disaster waiting to happen from an invasive species standpoint,” said Russell Campbell, chief of the Department of Agriculture’s Biosecurity Division.

People might not generally think of green waste as being harmful, but stacks of debris can provide the perfect breeding environment for species such as the coconut rhinoceros beetle.

That’s exactly what happened after Typhoon Dolphin swept across the island in May 2015, according to University of Guam entomologist Aubrey Moore. Tree damage from the storm resulted in more breeding sites for the beetle.

Guam Invasive Species Council establishes committee for managing green waste

Opinion: Emergency fund needed to fight invaders

When vegetation is moved from one place to another, which also happened with waste generated during Typhoon Dolphin, unwanted plants and insects can move with it. According to a 2016 report from the university, a temporary green waste collection site was set up at Oka Point after the storm. Later, invasive little fire ants were found near the collection site.

The committee is a good start for coordinating green waste management across government agencies. The recommended list of members includes representatives from the Department of Agriculture, the Guam Environmental Protection Agency, utility agencies and the Navy.

Once established, the committee could provide education and outreach to homeowners, contractors, mayors and others who frequently find themselves working with green waste.

Invasive species are hard to eradicate, but by controlling green waste, we can help contain their spread. If you see a strange plant, animal or insect, you can report it by calling the invasive species hotline at 475-PEST (475-7378).

For more tips on preventing the spread of invasive species, visit the National Invasive Species Information Center at  www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/news/whatyou.shtml .
