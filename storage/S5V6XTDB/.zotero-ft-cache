A. Identify species and activity:
1. For a new Recovery permit: a. Provide the common and scientiﬁc names of the species being requested for coverage in the permit and their status (endangered (E) or threatened (T)). Hypolimnas octocula marianensis Mariana eight-spot butterﬂy Endangered
2. Provide the number, age, and sex of each species to the extent known.
Not known
3. Identify the activity sought to be authorized (i.e., presence/absence survey, nest monitoring, bird banding, etc.) for each species.
Collection of 30 eggs and/or larvae to establish a captive population
4. Identify location of the proposed activity:
All activity will be performed on the island of Guam. Eggs and/or caterpillars will be collected from limestone cliﬀ areas in northern Guam and captive rearing will be done at the the University of Guam Agricultural Experiment Station in Yigo, Guam.
5. Describe the proposed activity:
Proposed activity is described in the attached proposal entitled “Establishment of Captive and Managed Populations of the Mariana Eight-spot Butterﬂy, Hypolimnas octocula marianensis”. The objective of this proposal is to partially implement an action plan for H. octocula published in Guam’s Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategies. The proposal was accepted and funded by USFWS and two University of Guam biologists, Dr. Aubrey Moore and Dr. Curt Fiedler, began work on the project. Unfortunately, the project was put on hold pending issuance of a recovery permit following listing of H. octocula in late 2015.
6. Identify the persons conducting the proposed activity:
The proposed activity will be performed by two University of Guam biologists. Both have worked with the eight-spot butterﬂy for several years.
Dr. Aubrey Moore (CV avalable in section 3.1) Dr. Curt Fiedler (CV avalable in section 3.2)

7. Identify the location of aﬀected species, to the extent known: The eight-spot butterﬂy is still in the wild in limited areas on Guam.
The exact distribution areas are not well studied. However, it seems that the host plants are limited to areas where ungulate activities are reduced – i.e., hard to reach deep karst areas near cliﬀ areas.

GUAM STATE WILDLIFE GRANT PROGRAM: T-12-R-1 Grant Period: October 1, 2013-September 30, 2014
PROJECT TITLE: Establishment of Captive & Managed Populations of the Mariana Eight-Spot Butterfly (Hypolimnas octocula marianensis)
INTRODUCTION Projects funded by the State Wildlife Grant Program (SWGP) are administered within the Wildlife Section of the Guam Agriculture’s Division of Aquatic and Wildlife Resources. Guam’s Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy (GCWCS) is the guiding document for projects funded under SWGP. The cost for T-12 FY2014 project is $23,212.00.
NEED The Mariana eight-spot butterfly, Hypolimnas octocula marianensis, also known as the forest flicker, is a candidate for listing under the US Federal Endangered Species Act (1973). This rare butterfly subspecies is currently found only in Guam's limestone forest habitat where its larval host plants Procris pedunculata and Elatostema calcareum occur.
The GCWCS goal, objectives and action plan for conserving this subspecies are: • Goal: To establish a viable population of H. o. marianensis in Guam • Objectives: To survey on Guam habitats containing Procris spp.. To study seasonal population dynamics of H. o. marianensis in the laboratory, culture H. o. marianensis in the laboratory, survey natural enemies, study the biology of the butterfly, and release laboratory reared butterfly in the Procris habitats • Action Plan: Habitat degradation and loss: Identify and map occurrences of Procris pedunculata. Reduce impacts of ungulates and invasive plants in limestone forests areas where Procris occurs. Small or extirpated population: Conduct monthly surveys at the Hilaan Point to observe seasonal activity for this butterfly species, and cultivate caterpillars of this species and rear them to adult stage in a parasite and predation free enclosure for propagation. Release reared in the lab adults in limestone habitats where the host plant is abundant and especially in conservation areas of Guam.
Larval host plants of the butterfly are heavily browsed by ungulates and many areas where they exist are being cleared for military buildup and associated development projects. Although there have been several recent surveys H. o. marianensis and its host plants, no work has been done towards establishing captive and managed populations of H. o. marianensis and its host plants.
The project will investigate the feasibility of rearing and breeding H. o. marianensis on host plants in cages and also in field sites where ungulates are excluded. The establishment of captive breeding colonies and managed populations of this rare butterfly will reduce risk of extinction. However, in order to maintain or increase the habitat available for the recovery of the eight-spot butterfly the public must be engaged to

SWGP T-12-R-1 Project Narrative

preserve and/or establish habitat on private lands. Awareness materials that encourage the preservation of limestone habitat and establishment of butterfly gardens will assist in enlisting the support of the public to preserve and protect Guam’s species of greatest conservation need.
OBJECTIVES
1. Propagate and maintain at least 100 plants of each of the eight-spot's known host plants, Procris pendunculata and Elatostema calcareum in a plant nursery.
2. Establish a self-sustaining, caged, breeding colony of eight-spot butterflies using 30 field-collected caterpillars reared on plants from the nursery.
3. Propagate host plants throughout two 10 x 10 meter, wooded limestone areas at the University of Guam's Agricultural Experiment Station in Yigo.
4. Release 60 cage-reared eight-spot butterflies and larvae on protected host plants. 5. Produce 2000 posters and fact sheets on eight-spot butterflies to encourage the
establishment of butterfly gardens (i.e., habitat) on private and public lands.

BENEFITS This project will create and protect fragile habitat of a SGCN. The development of
captive propagation and release techniques for the Mariana eight-spot butterfly can be used for future projects to reestablish the butterfly in other places on Guam. Future projects could include butterfly gardens in private and public lands. Butterflies are important for pollination of host plant species. The public awareness materials produced within this project will assist with the development of future areas where butterflies can be established. Awareness of Guam’s SGCN helps produce a public that expects conservation actions from their government and supports policies to preserve and protect Guam’s natural resources.
APPROACH
1. Guam Department of Agriculture will sub-grant $21,212.00 to the University of Guam (UOG) via a Memorandum of Understanding between the Guam Department of Agriculture and the UOG to complete objectives related to the propagation of eight-spot butterflies and their host plants for the establishment of the captive and managed populations.
2. Propagate and maintain at least 100 plants of each of the eight-spot's known host plants, Procris pendunculata and Elatostema calcareum in a plant nursery. Host plants will be collected in the wild and propagated from cuttings. A nursery containing at least 100 plants of each species will be established and maintained to supply food for caged insects and starts for out-planting in ungulate-free areas. Botanists Lauren Gutierrez and John Benedict have established successful protocols for propagating host plant species.
3. Establish a self-sustaining, caged, breeding colony of eight-spot butterflies using 30 field-collected caterpillars reared on plants from the nursery. Ten H. o. marianensis caterpillars will be placed in each of 3 screen cages (BugDorm;

SWGP T-12-R-1 Project Narrative

Page 4

6620 Insect Rearing Cage; 60x60x120cm) containing Procris pendunculata plants from the nursery. Founding members of the colony will be field collected as
caterpillars. At each field collection site, we will collect no more than 25% of the caterpillars available on each site visit date. Upon generation of F1 offspring, we
will expand the colony to 6 cages. Generation time, food consumption, host plant preference and fecundity will be recorded.
4. Propagate host plants throughout two 10 x 10 meter, wooded limestone areas at the University of Guam's Agricultural Experiment Station in Yigo.
Permission for this work to be completed within the fenced property of the University of Guam's Agricultural Experiment Station in Yigo has already been
granted. Host plants from the nursery will be out-planted into two 10 m by 10 m plots within forested limestone at UOG Yigo Experiment Station. Out-plantings
will be monitored to ensure growth and establishment. 5. Release 60 cage-reared eight-spot butterflies and larvae on protected host
plants. After establishment of host plants at the experiment station, we will release individuals from the breeding colony. In one plot, we will release 30
marked, sexed butterflies. In the other plot, we will release 30 late instar caterpillars. During weekly visits we will count all life stages of H. o. marianensis
populations in both plots and look for signs of predation, parasitism and competition for host plants.
6. Produce 2000 posters and fact sheets on eight-spot butterflies to encourage the establishment of butterfly gardens (i.e., habitat) on private and public
lands. Guam Division of Aquatic & Wildlife will design a poster and develop an instruction sheet for preserving and creating butterfly habitat. Posters will be
distributed to target audiences.
