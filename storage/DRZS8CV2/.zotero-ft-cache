ABSTRACT
One hundred and .slxty Oryctes rhinoceros (L.) beetles, collected from 30 villages of Godavari districts of Andhra Prasesh were screened for baculovirus disease. Examination of gross morphology of midgut and giemsastained smears of midgut aspirates and squash showed typical symptoms of baculovirus infection in 53.1% beetles. Similarly, O. rhinoceros grubs from 14.0% breeding sites in GudapaJli village and 20.0% breeding sites in AIlavaram village showed the disease symptoms with 8.4% and 4.0% grub Infection respectively. ~esent survey reveals the presence of Oryctes bacnlovlrus In Andhra Pradesh.

KEY WORDS: Baculovirus, natural incidence, Oryctes rhinoceros, coconut

The rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros (L.) is a major pest of coconut palm with a wide-distribution in Asia (Menon and Pandalai, 1958). The adult beetle bores through the unopened fronds and young spathes cau.sing severe damage and consequently a setbac~ in the growth of the palm and nut production is seen. Among the various methods of pest management, biological suppression using the baculovirus of O.rhinoceros is preferred for its long term effects and ecological acceptance. Baculovirus of Oryctes is claimed to be one of the most successful microbial control agents employed against an insect pest (Caltagirone, 1981). This disease was first reported by Huger in 1966 in Malaysia on O. rhinoceros. In India, the virus was first reported to occur in O.rhinoceros population of Kerala ·(Mohan et al., 1983) and later from Tamil Nadu (Rajamanickam et al., 1989). With a view to knowing the natural occurrence of the virus disease in O.rhinoceros populations of Andhra Pradesh, a detailed survey was initiated in 1989.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
One hundred and sixty O.rhinoceros beetles were collected from crowns of infested coconut palms and breeding sites from 29 villages in East Godavari district and one village of west Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh (Table 1). The beetles were dissected and examined for baculovirus disease using the folloWing diagnostic methods (Mohan et al., 1983); i. Visual examination of midgut and its contents and ii. examination of giemsastained smear of midgut contents.
Three hundred andten grubs from 50breeding sites of Gudapalli village and seventy five grubs from 15 breeding sites of Allavaram village of East Godavari district were observed for the presence of baculovirus (Table 2). Grubs from each breeding site were maintained in separate containers containing sterilized farm-yard manure. The grubs were periodically observed for external symptoms of baculovirus disease for a period of 30 days. The grubs which showed external symptoms ofdisease were dissected and stained smears of the midgut epithelium were examined for confirmation of virus disease.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The midguts of diseased beetles were swollen~ white in colour and contained a lot of mucoid white fluid while the midguts of· . healthy beetles were thin, brown in colciur and contained very little brownish fluid.
Giemsa-stained smears of diseased midguts contained hypertrophied nuclei. These nuclei were distinct by the presence of a perinuclear ring which is uniformly stained in deep pink colour. The darkly stained granular network in the centre of nuclei suggested derangeme~t of nuclei. In midgut smears of healthy beetles, the nuclei were small with purple chromatin network with uniformly distributed nucleoplasm. These observations are in conformity with the descriptions made by Mohan et ale (1983). Microscopic observation showed nucleus and cytoplasm in various stages i.e., slightly hypertrophied nuclei, granulated nucleoplasm, typical hypertrophied nuclei, with perinuclear ring indicating the diSease intensity from initial to advanced stage. In general, the number of nuclei observed in diseased gut aspirates and squashes was more than that in healthy guts. Also gut aspirates presented a clear picture of nuclei than gut squashes. Mohan et al. (1983) reported similar observations.

Out of the 160 beetles screened for baculovirus, 53.1 per cent of the beetles was confirmed to be diseased both by visual symptoms and also by smear test (Table 1).
Virus - infected grubs were sluggish and stopped feeding. As a result, their cuticle became flaccid and turned waxy on the dorsal side. When the diseased grubs were cut open, the guts were found filled with white fluid but not food material. In contrast, the healthy grubs were active~ robust and fed well. Their cuticle was turgid, glossy and from the dorsal side presence of food materials inside· the body could be seen. These symptoms match with the description given by Huger (1966) and Mohan et al.(1985). The infected grubs did not reach pupation. Giemsa-stained smears of diseased midguts showed hypertrophied nuclei with sparse blue cytoplasm while healthy nuclei were small and well defined. Similar observations were reported by Mohan et al. (1985).
Out of the 50 breeding sites of Gudapalli village, grubs in seven breeding sites showed symptoms of baculovirus (Table 2). The disease intensity in the seven breeding sites ranged from 25-100%. Among the 15 breeding sites of Allavaram ~illage, grubs in three breeding sites showed symptoms of baculovirus disease (Table 2).

In the present studies, in addition to visual examination, smear test was employed which accocdi!1g t~ .Mo!uin et 01. (1983), besides im. niuno!.osmophoresis (lOP), is ideal for screening large population of beetles. The observations of smear test in the present studies corroborated the visual diagnosis of disease.
