    Everyone can see the coordinates unless the taxon is threatened.
Obscured
    Public coordinates shown as a random point within 10KM of the true coordinates. True coordinates are only visible to you and the curators of projects to which you add the observation.
private
    Coordinates completely hidden from public maps, true coordinates only visible to you and the curators of projects to which you add the observation. Observations with private coordinates will still be used to verify place check lists.

Species
Remarks (optional)
Organism appears captive / cultivated
Was the organism cultivated or captive ? For example, was it in a garden, zoo, aquarium or some other situation in which it was only present because human beings intended it to be there ? All observations of living things are welcome, but we'd like to know when things are not wild / naturalized.

Details Hide details

The data quality assessment is a summary of an observation's accuracy. All observations start as "casual" grade, and become "needs ID" when

    the observation has a date
    the observation is georeferenced (i.e. has lat/lon coordinates)
    the observation has photos or sounds

Observations become "research grade" when

    the iNat community agrees with the observer's ID , where an "agreeing" identification is one that matches exactly or is of a child taxon of the observer's ID. For example, if Scott says it's a mammal and Ken-ichi says it's Homo sapiens , then Ken-ichi agrees with Scott.

Observations will revert to "casual" if the above conditions aren't met or

    the community agrees the location doesn't looks accurate (e.g. monkeys in the middle of the ocean, hippos in office buildings, etc.)
    the community agrees the organism isn't wild/naturalized (e.g. captive or cultivated by humans or intelligent space aliens)
    the community agrees the observation no longer needs an ID and the community ID is above family
