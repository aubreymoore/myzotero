Potentials for utilizing and controlling insect pathogens Richou Han, Xuehong Qiu and Xun Yan
Guangdong Entomological Institute, 105 Xingang Road West, Guangzhou 510260, China
Address for Correspondence: hanrc@gdei.gd.cn
Insects are attacked by different invertebrate pathogens. Diverse strategies are used to deal with these pathogens. In this presentation, three examples are presented to show the utilization and control of insect pathogens in Guangdong Entomological Institute, China: (1) Ophiocordyceps sinensis fungus as health food. O. sinensis (Clavicipitaceae) (best known as Cordyceps sinensis) is one of the entomopathogenic fungi endemic on above 3000 m Tibetan Plateau. The fungus parasitizes larvae of moths (Lepidoptera) and fruiting bodies grow from the infected larvae. Regarded as “Himalayan Viagra”, the fungus-insect complex is used to treat a variety of ailments including fatigue, impotence and cancer, and costs $60000–$75000 per kilogram. The growing worldwide demand and resource limitation drive the research to artificial cultivation of this fungus for commercial trade. (2) Photorhabdus bacteria for insect control. Photorhabdus bacteria associated with entomopathogenic Heterorhabditis nematodes produce oral protein toxins for killing insects. For sustainable termite control, the toxic genes are transformed into Enterobacter cloacae, one of the indigenous gut bacteria of the Formosan subterranean termite (Coptotermes formosanus), and the termites are fed with these genetically modified bacteria. (3) Control of Chinese sacbrood virus (CSBV) by RNAi-mediated technology. CSBV is the most serious virus of oriental honey bees Apis cerana. To protect the honey bees, RNAi technology is successfully used to control this harmful virus, by feeding second instar larvae of A. cerana with specific sequences of CSBV double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The results from these examples show the research strategies in invertebrate pathology and potentials for implementing the research results in commercial purpose. Key words: Invertebrate pathogens, Ophiocordyceps sinensis, Photorhabdus bacteria, CSBV Funding: This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31010103912 and 31000879), Guangdong Provincial Science & Technology Project (No. 2012B050700008 and 2010A040301012) and Funding of Guangdong Academy of Sciences for Young Scientist (No. qnjj201301).

Story of an African firm: 10 years in the biopesticide business – lessons learned along the way Sean Moore
Citrus Research International, Port Elizabeth, South Africa; Rhodes University, Grahamstown, South Africa
Address for Correspondence: seanmoore@cri.co.za

In 2003, River Bioscience in South Africa became the first African company to successfully produce and commercialise an insect virus as a biopesticde. This was the Cryptophlebia leucotreta granulovirus (CrleGV). The outcome was instant success, mainly due to the good fortune of perfect timing. The target pest, the false codling moth (Thaumatotibia leucotreta), was a very serious one and there was a dearth of alternative products. River Bioscience originated as a spin-off company from grower-funded citrus research and for the first few years of existence, served that single agricultural sector as a oneproduct company: a high risk situation. Subsequently, the company expanded its product range into other viruses, including the Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolydrovirus (HearNPV) and the Cydia pomonella granulovirus (CpGV), entomopathogenic nematodes and a range of biorational products, such as Attract and Kill products for a range of fruit fly species. The success of the commercial venture can be attributed to a number of factors, including product quality and competitiveness, being market driven rather than product driven, starting small (hence not over capitalizing) and growing organically, a close association with research organisations and being owned by its major market – the citrus growers. However, all has not been moonlight and roses: many hard lessons have been learned. For example, simply having a good product is not sufficient – it is the way in which the product is marketed that determines how it sells relative to the competition, which has increased dramatically since the emergence of the company.

A Roadmap to the Successful Development and Commercialization of Microbial Pest Control Products for
Control of Arthropods Willem J. Ravensberg Koppert Biological Systems, Veilingweg 14, 2651 BE Berkel en Rodenrijs, the Netherlands Address for Correspondence: wravensberg@koppert.nl
Microbial pesticides have been developed for a hundred years, but many of these crop protection products have not been successful in the market. Therefore, there is a need for a model that facilitates the development and commercialization of these products. A model has been developed for a biocontrol product based on entomopathogenic bacteria, fungi, viruses and nematodes. The model aims to develop a rational and structured approach that will increase the chances of achieving success with microbial pest control products. The building blocks of the entire process are identified and essential aspects highlighted. This systematic roadmap with a strong focus on economics and market introduction will assist academic researchers and industrial developers of biopesticides in accomplishing their goal: the development of successful cost-effective biopesticides.

BASF Functional Crop Care. Unlocking Agricultural Potential in Soil, Seed and Crop Sebastian Bachem BASF – Limburgerhof, Germany
Address for Correspondence: sebastian.bachem@basf.com
For many years BASF has been active in the area of biological pest control with its pheromone based mating disruption solutions and in 2012 it acquired the leading biologicals company Becker Underwood. With its broad range of seed,

38

soil and foliar products Becker Underwood was an excellent fit and has now been fully integrated into the company. The presentation will outline the different key segments BASF is focusing on in the areas of soil, seed and foliar treatments. Furthermore it will focus on the main opportunities BASF sees in developing an integrated portfolio of biological and chemical products that are able to reliably cover a broad spectrum of farmer’s needs. Beyond this we will look forward and outline how we expect the crop protection market to develop and what motivates BASF to invest into finding best possible solutions to meet these changing market demands.

Small molecule signals in nematodes - common motifs and species specific modifications Stephan H. von Reuss
Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Department of Bioorganic Chemistry, Jena, Germany
Address for Correspondence: svonreuss@ice.mpg.de
Chemical communication in nematodes via small molecule signals has been known since the 1960s. However, despite considerable efforts chemical structures have remained elusive for several decades. Recent research focusing on the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans has revealed a modular library of small molecule signals, the ascarosides, glycolipids of the dideoxysugar ascarylose linked to fatty acid derived side chains, that modulate nematode development and behavior. Furthermore, we have shown that production of ascaroside components is highly conserved among nematodes from different clades, life-styles and ecological niches. Our ongoing research aims to comprehensively characterize ascaroside signaling in selected nematode species including bacteriovorus and entomopathogenic species. Identification of putative ascaroside signals is accomplished using our recently developed highly sensitive HPLC-MS/MS precursor ion screen that facilitates the detection of known and novel ascaroside components in crude nematode metabolome extracts. Novel ascarosides are subsequently isolated by SPE and HPLC and identified using a combination of HR-MS/MS and NMR techniques. We found that diverse nematode species share a large variety of common ascarosides and in addition also produce several highly species-specific derivatives. Chemical synthesis and subsequent functional characterization of these putative small molecule signals in different nematodes will reveal their importance in intra- and interspecific communication and help to decipher the evolution of ascaroside signaling in nematodes.

Olfactory Plasticity in Entomopathogenic Nematodes Joon Ha Lee and Elissa Hallem
University of California, Los Angeles, USA Address for Correspondence: ehallem@microbio.ucla.edu
Many parasites, including entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs), use host-emitted olfactory cues to locate hosts. However, how parasitic nematodes respond to host-emitted odors remains poorly understood. In particular, little is known about how parasitic nematodes integrate host odor cues with environmental cues such as temperature and intrinsic cues

such as age to mediate context-appropriate host-seeking behaviors. To address this question, we are investigating the olfactory behavior of EPNs from the genera Steinernema and Heterorhabditis. We find that EPNs are attracted to the general host cue carbon dioxide under all conditions tested. However, responses to many odorants exhibit extreme olfactory plasticity as a function of IJ cultivation temperature and/or age. For example, in Steinernema carpocapsae, many odorants that are strongly attractive at lower temperatures are strongly repulsive at higher temperatures and vice versa. This temperature-dependent olfactory plasticity occurs in individual IJs and is reversible, since temperature-swapping IJs reverses their olfactory preferences. By contrast, other species appear to show primarily age-dependent changes in olfactory preferences, while still other species show little or no olfactory plasticity. Thus, the type and extent of olfactory plasticity varies among EPNs. In addition, we find that foraging strategy can also vary with temperature. For example, Steinernema carpocapsae behaves more like an ambusher at higher temperatures and more like a cruiser at lower temperatures. Some EPNs are found in geographical regions that undergo substantial seasonal temperature variation, and we hypothesize that plasticity of olfactory behavior and foraging strategy may enable EPNs to optimize host seeking under changing environmental conditions.

Plants can influence the behavior of and modify community composition of soil dwelling organisms through the exudation of organic molecules. Given the chemical complexity of the soil matrix, soil-dwelling organisms have evolved the ability to detect and respond to these cues for successful foraging. A key question is how specific these responses are and how they may evolve. Soil nematodes are a group of diverse functional and taxonomic types, which may reveal a variety of responses. Herbivore-induced volatile emissions benefit plant hosts by recruiting natural enemies of herbivorous insects. Such tritrophic interactions have been examined thoroughly in aboveground terrestrial environments. Recently, similar signals have been described in the subterranean environment, which may be of equal importance for indirect plant defense. Our work has shown that plant roots of citrus defend themselves against root herbivores by releasing an herbivoreinduced plant volatile (HIPV), pregeijerene (1,5-dimethylcyclodeca-1,5,7-triene), that attracts naturally occurring entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) to larvae when applied in the field. However, the soil community is complex, containing a diversity of interspecies relationships that modulate food web assemblages. In a series of experiments we examine the specificity of this HIPV in the complex nematode community, including beneficial entomopathogenic nematodes, plant-parasitic nematodes, as well as, hyper-parasitic nematodes and nematophagous fungi. We provide the first evidence showing subterranean HIPVs behave much the

The ban of the fumigant methyl bromide has led to a need for new methods to control soil-dwelling plant pests. The use of semiochemicals is one such avenue of research since studies of plants above ground release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in response to herbivory have resulted in effective control methods for insect pests and also plant roots might release induced VOCs that attract organisms such as entomopathogenic nematodes. However, studies of such below ground interactions lags because of the complexity of the system. For example, in addition to plants roots, potentially important VOCs can be produced also by microorganisms, insects and nematodes and in soil VOCs are released into a virtually static airspace where they disperse solely by diffusion. To bypass this complexity root-related VOCs have been sampled by transferring roots from a pot to an artificial environment where most of the air surrounding the roots is drawn through an adsorption filter that trap VOCs, or by maceration and solvent extraction. This creates an artificial VOC profile with little relevance to the system intended to be studied. To address the need for more sensitive and less intrusive in vivo studies of below-ground VOC governed interactions probes were designed for direct in-soil sampling. In combination with improved thermal desorption GC/MS analyses the probes allowed short sampling times and required removal of minimal air volumes. This technique makes it possible to continuously monitor and follow the dynamics of root zoon VOCs in response to insect or nematode infestations.

discovery of alternative actives that can complement or substitute for Cry toxins. A screen of bacterial collections led to the discovery of several insecticidal protein genes with great potential for developing insect resistant crops. Two examples representing actives from non-Bacillus sources will be presented: PIP-1A is a 30 kD protein isolated form a Pseudomonas strain showing strong activity against hemipteran and certain lepidopteran pests. AfIP-1A and AfIP1B is a pair of binary proteins isolated from an Alcaligenes strain demonstrating potent corn rootworm killing activity. Corn plants expressing this pair of proteins display high resistance to WCRW. Preliminary studies on AfIP-1A and AfIP-1B in terms of protein biochemical characteristics, insecticidal activity spectrum and insect mid-gut binding properties indicate this pair of binary proteins may function in ways similar to some Cry proteins from Bacillus sources. Our work demonstrates that bacteria that are not Bacillus can be valuable sources of insecticidal proteins.

The plant bugs Lygus hesperus and Lygus lineolaris have emerged as economic pests of cotton in the United States. These hemipteran species are not controlled by the lepidopteran-specific insect control traits (Bacillus thuringiensis Cry proteins) found in genetically-modified commercial varieties of cotton. We have identified several novel Bt Cry proteins that are toxic to Lygus nymphs in artificial diet bioassays. Several of these proteins have been further modified to exhibit improved toxicity towards both Lygus species while retaining the insecticidal specificity of the parent protein. Cotton plants expressing modified Cry proteins show enhanced protection from Lygus feeding damage in the field.

Pseudomonas protegens is a plant-associated bacterium that is not only able to promote plant growth by efficiently protecting roots from attack by fungal phytopathogens but also can turn into an insect pathogen. The microorganism is capable of killing certain pest insects upon oral infection. The major goal of our work is to understand the molecular mechanisms that allow P. protegens and related bacteria to detect, to survive within and to kill the insect host. The entomopathogenic activity of P. protegens relies in part on the production of an insecticidal toxin termed Fit. We found that the pseudomonad produces the Fit toxin in the insect host, but not on plant roots, demonstrating that the bacterium is capable of distinguishing between these two environments. An array of sensor proteins makes bacteria able to sense the environment they live in and to adapt their behavior accordingly. Here we provide evidence that the sensor histidine kinase FitF is a key regulator of insecticidal toxin production. Our experimental data and bioinformatic analyses indicate that FitF shares a sensing domain with DctB, a histidine kinase regulating carbon uptake in Proteobacteria. This suggests that FitF has acquired its specificity through domain shuffling from a common ancestor. This particular event appeared to be crucial for host-dependent activation of toxin production and thus contributed to the evolution of insect pathogenicity in these bacteria. We propose that inhibition of the FitF sensor during root colonization is the underlying mechanism by which P. protegens differentiates between the plant and insect host..

The Gram positive, spore forming bacteria Paenibacillus larvae is the causative agent of American Foulbrood, a fatal disease affecting the brood of honey bees. The whole vegetative life cycle of P. larvae takes place inside the larvae and all micronutrition must be obtained from the hostincluding iron- a scarce atom essential for growth of host and pathogen likewise. Bacteria often answer this iron deficiency with the production of siderophores, small molecules which act as powerful iron chelators. Such siderophores are often synthesized by mulitenzyme complexes through nonribosomal peptide-synthetases (NRPS). The genes of these multienzyme complexes are arranged in giant gene clusters. Here we present data on the identification of an NRPS gene cluster in P. larvae encoding the biosynthetic machinery for

the production of a siderophore, which was identified as bacillibactin by MS/MS. Exposure bioassays with mutant P. larvae strains lacking bacillibactin production showed that neither total mortality nor disease progression in infected larvae was significantly changed compared to larvae infected with the corresponding wild-type strain. These results are in line with results published on the role of bacillibactin in other pathogenic bacteria like Bacillus thuringiensis and B. anthracis.

The entomopathogenic spore-forming bacteria, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), is widely distributed around the world and is able to produce toxins with insecticidal activity during the vegetative and sporulation phase. The great genetic variety of B. thuringiensis strains represents a huge diversity of potential insecticidal proteins. The host range of these proteins is highly variable, but includes a large number of species of the most damaging lepidopteran insect pests and also, other harmful species of the orders Diptera, Coleoptera and Hymenoptera. In order to extend the number of Bt proteins active against important coleopteran and lepidopteran pests, total DNA of a strain from a Spanish collection was completely sequenced. Two ORFs of 900 bp were selected due to their low identity with other Bt proteins and were cloned in a Bt expression plasmid. Proteins were produced and their insecticidal activity was determined. Bm_47 protein was toxic against Leptinotarsa decemlineata, with an LC50 of 54 μg/ml, while Bm_1711 protein was active against the lepidopterans Helicoverpa armigera and Ostrinia nubilalis, with an LC50 of 164 and 34 ng/cm2, respectively. We discuss the importance of this protein to combat species of coleopteran and lepidopteran pests, including species that have developed resistance to other Bt toxins..

Bacillus thuringiensis has been used as an effective bioinsecticide because it produces the proteins Cry and Cyt, which are highly toxic to insects in certain situations. But, recently B. thuringiensis was treated as a biological control agent which could control the plant disease. We already demonstrated that the antagonistic activity of B. thuringiensis AS17 japonensis, AS18 kurstaki against Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycospersici race2 (FOL) was examined by dual culture technique( Qi et al. 2013). In this study, B. thuringiensis strains could control the development of wilt symptoms caused by FOL in tomato plants was confirmed. Inoculate six

strains of B. thuringiensis suspension to the tomato seedlings in pot, and transplanted the treated tomato seedlings to FOL infested soil, after 4 weeks the development of wilt symptoms and wilting score become less than control, especially B. thuringiensis AS17 japonensis and AS20 CR371-H. Also, this study proved that B. thuringiensis strains are PGPR. PGPR (Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria) are beneficial bacteria which have the ability to colonize the plant roots and either promotes plant growth through direct action or via biological control of plant diseases. Six strain of Insect Pathogenic Bacillus thuringiensis were tested for PGPR effect. Culture filtrates of six strains had remarkable plant growth promotion activity in tomato and alfalfa plants; in each plant after treatment of culture filtrates, both of seed germination rates and the fresh weight were increased compared with control treatment.

Vibrios cause major losses in shellfish farming and are associated to recurrent mortalities of oysters. However, to date, the role of plankton species in the transmission of pathogenic vibrios in oyster Crassostrea gigas is largely unknown. The main objective of the present study was to identify in situ and in vitro the interactions of pathogenic Vibrios with local species of planktons from different sites of Thau lagoon, an important region for shellfish farming in south of France. QuantitativePCR was used to monitor Vibrio splendidus and Vibrio aestuarianus over the year 2013 at two sites of the Thau lagoon. Out of the oyster farm area, V. splendidus was found from May to July and from June to August associated to 5-180 µm and >180µm plankton fractions, respectively. V. aestuarianus was also detected in fraction 5-180 µm in May and >180µm in August, before and after the warmer months of the year. For the farm oysters point, V. splendidus was found in January and June associated with the 5-180 µm plankton and with the >180 µm fraction in spring and winter. V. aestuarianus was not detected. In laboratory controlled conditions, by using a GFP-expressing V. splendidus LGP32 and epifluorescence microscopy, we showed that V. splendidus LGP32 exhibits strong interactions with copepods of the Acartia and Paracartia genius as well as with microalgae of the Alexandrium genius. Altogether, our data show that vibrios pathogenic for oysters can establish close associations with plankton species, which may enhance the transmission of pathogenic vibrios to oysters.

Investigation of Baculovirus RNA Polymerase Subunit Protein-Protein Interactions with in vivo Bimolecular
Fluorescence Complementation Assays Jessica Breznik, Nicola Johnson, Mustapha El-Ayoubi and
Eric B Carstens Queen’s University, Kingston, Canada Address for Correspondence: Carstens@queensu.ca
Baculovirus transcription utilizes two different DNA-directed RNA polymerases (RNAPs): the insect host RNAP transcribes early genes while a virus RNAP transcribes late and very late genes. The virus RNAP consists of four proteins: P47, LEF-4, LEF-8 and LEF- 9. Conserved motifs in LEF-8 and LEF-9 suggest that the interface of these subunits forms the catalytic site of the RNAP, while LEF-4 has RNA capping-associated enzymatic activities. No specific function has yet been demonstrated for P47. To investigate the in vivo intracellular localization and interactions of these proteins, two individually non-fluorescent fragments (V1 and V2) of the Venus yellow fluorescent protein were fused with the N-termini of each RNAP subunit in plasmid expression vectors. We also constructed similar fusions with two components of the virus replisome complex, LEF-3 and P143, and of the host Spodoptera frugiperda TATA binding protein. Bacmids, expressing each of these fusion proteins, were constructed and used to generate recombinant viruses expressing each of the V1- or V2-tagged protein subunits. Protein-protein interactions of these subunits were investigated using bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. Coinfections were used to investigate the interactions of these subunits in the presence of the full complement of virus proteins. Reciprocal co-transfections of the original plasmid constructs were performed to investigate the potential for these proteins to form homo-oligomers, as well as their ability to interact with heterologous partners in the absence of any other viral proteins. The results of co-transfection and coinfection assays will be presented.

Characterization and Quantitative Analysis of Autographa californica Multiple Nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV)

Localization of AcMNPV FP25K was previously studied by western blot using fractionation. This study, however, was not quantitative. By inactivating the endogenous fp25k gene through passage of the AcBacmid in Sf21 cells and subsequent insertion of an fp25k-egfp fusion gene at the polyhedrin locus, we investigated FP25K localization during infection. Western blot confirmed the 53-kDa FP25K-EGFP fusion protein from infected cells. By using a nuclear stain, we were able to assess and quantify the nuclear to cytoplasmic localization of FP25K-EGFP during Hi5 and Sf9 cell infection through confocal microscopy. During late phase of infection, small aggregates were formed and FP25K-EGFP was found exclusively in the cytoplasm. However, during very late phase of infection, larger aggregates were observed in both the

42

cytoplasm and nucleus and about 1% of FP25K-EGFP localized to the nucleus. In addition, bioinformatic analysis of FP25K predicts a highly conserved coiled-coil domain at the N-terminus. We hypothesize that this coiled-coil domain may be responsible for the formation of these amorphous aggregates in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Therefore, disruption of the coiled-coil domain will disorder aggregate formation. Quantifying FP25K localization and studying aggregate formation may help to understand the role of FP25K aggregates in infection and polyhedrin promoter activities.

sherrero@uv.es The association between parasitic wasp, its polydnavirus and the lepidopteran host can represent an interesting model to study the horizontal transfer of genes since three different genomes are simultaneously in contact. In this context, the transcriptome of Spodoptera exigua revealed the presence of eight unigenes with high homology to bracovirus genes. All of them encoded for lectin-like proteins except one coding for a protein with homology to proteins of unknown function, which we named gasmin. Sequence analysis of the genomic region of gasmin and of one of the bracovirus lectin-like proteins (SeBLL2) confirmed their integration into the S. exigua genome. Gasmin as well as the lectins were mainly expressed in the hemocytes which indicate their possible role in the interaction with the parasitic wasp and insect’s immune response. Functional analysis of gasmin revealed that this protein interacts with the cellular actin inhibiting its polymerization. This inhibition leads to a drastic reduction in the capacity of hemocytes to phagocytise bacteria. Moreover, high expression of gasmin reduces the multiplication and the production of baculovirus particles in cell culture experiments. Analysis of the bracovirus-derived lectins revealed that they respond to gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in addition to baculovirus infection. Remarkably, Se-BLL2 responds to all tested pathogens. Further characterization of Se-BLL2 showed that it recognizes and agglutinates gramnegative as well as gram-positive bacteria. The results obtained suggest that the insect has domesticated the viral genes to cope with infections by pathogens.

Address for correspondence: pkrell@uoguelph.ca
The baculovirus early/late me53 is conserved in all sequenced lepidopteran baculovirus genomes. If AcMNPV me53 is deleted, DNA replication is normal but virus replication and spread is severely compromised. The 449 amino acid AcMNPV ME53 is a nucleocapsid-associated protein colocalizing with the major envelope glycoprotein GP64 at putative “budding” foci on the cell membrane. However, ME53 also localizes to the nucleus. In the absence of an easily identifiable nuclear localization signal we wished to identify ME53 sequences responsible for its nuclear translocation. To that end we generated a series of HA- or GFP- tagged N and C-terminal and internal deletions of ME53 as well as internal ME53 peptides through a baculovirus bacmid intermediate. Localization of the tagged ME53 variants following bacmid transfection, was monitored by confocal fluorescence microscopy. An HA-tagged ME53 lacking aa83-152 was excluded from the nucleus while an internal HA-tagged aa83152 peptide showed nuclear localization. Further N-terminal deletions up to aa107 (or carboxy terminal deletions up to aa250) showed nuclear localization of GFP-tagged ME53, while N-terminal deletions up to aa121 did not. Among several internal deletions tested, the aa107-121 deletion lacked nuclear localization. Overlapping that region was an alphahelical domain aa107-133. However alanine mutagenesis of some of the basic residues (E121A, R122A, K126A and even double E121A/R122A) predicted to destroy the alphahelix, failed to prevent nuclear localization. As the aa83 to 152 peptide on its own showed nuclear localization we predict the ME53 nuclear localization domain to begin
between aa107 and 121 and end upstream of aa152.

The baculovirus dnapol is a core gene essential for viral DNA replication. The 984 aa AcMNPV DNApol has polymerase and 3’-5’ exonuclease domains spanning aa189-750. To determine if these domains were sufficient for viral DNA replication and virus production we generated a series of bacmids with DNApol C-terminal deletions. Virus spread and DNA replication were monitored following transfections using GFP

fluorescence. Deletion of the C-terminal 184 aas was detrimental to virus production, and even deletion of the Cterminal 36 aas severely compromised virus spread. Thus almost the entire C-terminus beyond the polymerase domain was required for normal virus replication. Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed this might be due to failure of DNApol nuclear localization. Of several expression plasmids with C-terminal DNApol truncations fused to EGFP, only pBC949, expressing DNApol aa1-949 translocated to the nucleus; shorter truncations remained cytoplasmic, mimicking the results for the same truncations in bacmid constructs. AA sequences in aa804-827 and aa939-948 were consistent with a bipartite and monopartite NLS, respectively. Peptides with either NLS fused to EGFP, independently allowed for strong nuclear localization. However, deletion of either NLS in DNApol:EGFP fusions resulted in only cytoplasmic DNApol:EGFP. A highly conserved C-terminal sequence at aa972-981 was found in all group I alphabaculoviruses. For bacmid constructs with alanine mutagenesis in this region, there was limited spread of GFP fluorescence but only by 144 hpt. Thus DNApol requires both NLSs and even the C-terminal 10 aas for nuclear translocation, viral DNA replication and virus production.

The Twist In Baculoviruses Loy Volkman
University of California, Berkeley, California, and Expression Systems, LLC, Davis, California
Address for Correspondence: lvolkman@berkeley.edu
It has been know for over forty years that baculovirus genomes are supercoiled ds DNA molecules, yet the implications of this fact has had little affect on current explanations of baculovirus replication and hyperexpression. It is now known that negatively supercoiled ds DNA is spontaneously bound by nucleosomes upon entering the nucleus, which is what happens to baculovirus genomes on nuclear entry. Because both replication and transcription require that nucleosomes be slid or removed for these processes to occur, baculoviruses also must be able to regulate chromosome remodeling. Two of the four major classes of chromasome remodelers, INO80 and SWI/SNF, contain actin as an essential subunit. If either or both were necessary for transitioning from late to very late gene expression, the observed transient dependence on polymerizable actin for the period of transition would be explained. Moreover, it is now known that replication of covalently-closed circular DNA in eukaryotic systems requires topoisomerase II (topo 2). Topo 2 makes double-strand breaks (DSBs) and DSB’s are considered to be among the most deleterious of DNA lesions. Their occurrence could explain the induction of the DNA damage response during baculovirus replication. SWI/SNF complexes facilitate topo 2 positioning for dsDNA cleavage, hence polymerizable actin is also required. An SV40-based model of baculovirus replication will be presented.

The nucleocapsids (NC) of alphabaculoviruses budded virus (BV) virions are assembled in the nuclei of infected cells, transported from the nucleus, through the cytoplasm and bud from the plasma membrane enabling systemic spread of infection. The AcMNPV viral protein AC141 (EXON0) is required for efficient BV production and has been shown to associate with β -tubulin and potentially directly interact with a Drosophila kinesin-1 TPR domain. The objective of this study was to determine if AC141 can associate with the host lepidopteran kinesin-1. To enable these studies the sequence of T. ni kinesin-1 heavy (KHC) and light (KLC) chains were identified from a transcriptome analysis of T. ni Tnms42 cells. T. ni KLC and KHC cDNAs were subsequently generated and cloned into plasmid expression vectors, and tagged at the 5’ and 3’ ends with Myc or HA epitope tags, or EGFP. These constructs were used to generate stably transformed High Five (BTI-Tn5B1-4) cell lines. Initial experiments showed that both N- and C-terminal HA-tagged KLC expressed in stable cell lines co-immunoprecipitates AC141 and β-tubulin. In addition, HA-tagged AC141 co-immunoprecipitates with WT KLC. Sequential confocal laser scanning microscopy shows that Myc-KLC in stable cell lines co-localizes with HA-AC141 in regions adjacent to the plasma membrane at 20, 24 and 48 hpi. This technique was also used to examine co-localization of AC141, microtubules and tagged KLC molecules. These studies provide additional support to a model in which the association of AC141 with microtubules plays an important role in anterograde trafficking of BV NCs .

The citrus greening also known as Huanglongbing or yellow dragon disease is one of the most serious citrus diseases in the world. This disease has devastated millions of hectares of citrus crops throughout Brazil and the United States. Considering that once infected the plant has no cure, the primary control strategies currently employed requires intensive use of chemical insecticides against the vector, Diaphorina citri. We have developed a new suspension concentrate formulation based on Isaria fumosorosea for controlling this pest. The product is effective against adults and nymphs of D. citri but it can also contribute to the management of other citrus pests such as the black citrus aphid, Toxoptera citricida, the citrus blackfly, Aleurocanthus woglumi, and the snow scale, Unaspi citri. The I. fumosorosea isolate used presented UV tolerance up to two times higher than other fungal isolates tested, and it is compatible and can be tank mixed with most chemicals sprayed in citrus

Field sprays (n= >15) on adults confined in voile bags on commercial citrus groves using 60mL of suspensions (2.5-5.0 x 106 conidia/mL) per m3 of leaf area in the citrus canopy caused total mortality ranging from 60-96%. Transmission of the fungus from D. citri and T. citricida cadavers to uninfected D. citri were effectively demonstrated in laboratory and semi-field conditions. The mycopesticide is currently in preparation for commercial registration.

Address for Correspondence: cgarciag@ipn.mx During autumn-winter 2012 was conducted a field trial with applications of biorational products B. thuringiensis (Versa™), Pyirethrins (Abatec™), S. carpocapsae (Capsanem™) and native strains of B.bassiana and water as control, against neonate larvae of tomato fruitworm Heliothis virescens (Fabricius) in a tomato crop cultivated in Guasave Sinaloa, México. The variables evaluated were larvae mortality (LM), fruit damage and yield. The better treatments were: B. thuringiensis 39.6%, Pyirethrins 32.3 % and S. carpocapsae 23.33%, while the native B. bassiana strains (2.1x106 spores/ml) had 6.3 to 6.6%, and the control 2.66% of LM after 72h. Not statistical differences were found in fruit damage between Versa and Abatec, but they were found in the control and Bb1 strain; in the yield, neither were founded differences between biorational products, these also showed the highest fruit yields, followed by Bb strains. These results indicated a lower field efficacy of fresh native Bb strains at this spore concentration, respect to the other products against H. virescens.

The entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium brunneum F52 (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) is able to produce environmentally persistent microsclerotia. Incorporating these desiccation-tolerant microsclerotia (Mb MS) granules into hydromulch [a mixture of water + wheat straw mulch + psyllium tackifier], represents a novel, easy-to-use and environmentally-friendly mycoinsecticide that can be sprayed onto the trunks of forest or orchard trees to control insect pests. Hydromulch holds moisture that allows microsclerotia to germinate, and the production of conidia in turn, causes lethal infections in Asian longhorned beetles, Anoplophora glabripennis Motschulsky (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae). To test how quickly beetles could be killed, moist and dry bark pieces and filter paper were sprayed with a low dose (~9 Mb MS/cm2) of microsclerotia in hydromulch. Median survival times of beetles exposed to moist bark and filter paper were 17.5 d and 19.5 d, respectively. Beetles exposed to dry bark died

significantly slower. In an attempt to kill beetles faster, moist bark pieces were sprayed with three doses of microsclerotia in hydromulch: low (6-9 Mb MS/cm2); medium (10-19 Mb MS/cm2) and high (20-30 Mb MS/cm2). At high doses, 50% of beetles died in 12.5 d but at lower doses it took significantly longer to kill beetles (16.5 d-17.5 d). In a two week oviposition period, total beetle fecundity was highest in high-humidity controls, females produced 18.5 viable offspring compared to high-humidity hydromulch treatments that significantly reduced fecundity to 7.9 viable offspring. This however was not significantly different from the low-humidity hydromulch (8.1 viable off spring) or that associated control (9.1 viable offspring). Outdoor spore production by microsclerotia, using moist bark pieces, sprayed with a high dose of hydromulch (20-30 Mb MS/cm2) and attached to trees in the woods was quantified. There was a significant increase in spore production over 24 days and in the second replicate (another 24 days) spore production was significantly higher than in the first replicate (P≤.0001). Importantly, rainfall was significantly correlated (P≤.0042) to this increase in spore production. Environmental moisture plays a big role in the spore production by microsclerotia and will subsequently affect the level of insect mortality.

Mealworm, Tenebrio molitor L. (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) has high and safe protein contents, which enables it to be animal feed. However, occurrence of entomopathogenic fungi in mealworms is one of the limitations for mass production. In this work, we investigated relationships between abiotic conditions and occurrence of fungal pathogens and established an effective control method using fungicides. In virulence assay, third instar mealworm larvae were sprayed by six entomopathogenic Beauveria bassiana isolates and kept under high relative humidity; B. bassiana ERL1575 isolate had highest virulence. Under normal humidity, ERL1575 conidian showed different virulence between spray (~0% virulence) and digestion (~80% virulence) method. Furthermore, mealworms, which digested conidia, were exposed to various temperature (20-35°C) and humidity (1-3 ml distilled water spray/35 mm diam. dish) conditions for 5 days. All the treatments showed ~90% virulence except 35°C incubations (~20% virulence), but irrespective to the humidity conditions. Forty chemical fungicides were assayed against conidial germination and hyphal growth of ERL1575. Fluazinam and mancozeb showed strong inhibition of conidial germination at standard application dose (SD), 1/2 SD and 1/5 SD; besides, fluazinam showed strong inhibition of hyphal growth. When fluazinam and mancozeb were applied to the fungal conidia-inoculated wheat bran, most of mealworms were alive after 3 days post application. However, high mortality rate (~100%) were observed in the conidia-inoculated wheat bran without any fungicides. In conclusion, this work suggests that B. bassiana isolates could be pathogens at <30°C when they were digested by mealworms, and fluazinam and mancozeb would be used as effective control agents against the pathogen.

respectively, than in the controls. The mean numbers of thrips per plant for the control and GHA treatments were not significantly different. Plant damage was 60% less on plants treated with the experimental fungi than the control and GHA treatments. At 10 wks post-application, 75-90% of WFT collected from the treatments were infected with the experimental isolates. These results demonstrate that soil applications of entomopathogenic fungi can reduce WFT populations significantly and prevent damage.
SYMPOSIUM 2 (Microsporidia) Monday, 16:30-18:30

Maize (Zea mays L.) is important for livelihoods in sub-Saharan Africa as it is the major staple food for the majority of people. In Tanzania 82 % of all farms, 4.5 million farmers in total, produce maize. The greater proportion of the maize (98 %) is produced by resource poor farmers, on an average of 0.8 hectares, in remote villages with poor road networks and post- harvest storage facilities which often make them incur high post-harvest losses. Grain loss in Africa due to insect pests’ damage in storage systems is estimated at 20 to 30 %. The larger grain borer (LGB), Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae), a native to meso-America, is known to cause considerable economic losses of up to 48% dry weight. While satisfactory control of LGB has been obtained by use of synthetic pesticides in Tanzania, since its accidental introduction in the late 1970s, their adverse effects on environment, possible development of resistance and residues in food have motivated the search for safer alternative methods. One such strategy is the use of biological control using entomopathogenic fungi such as Beauveria bassiana (Bals.-Criv.) Vuill. The current paper presents the findings of an ongoing laboratory study to evaluate the efficacy of a formulation (8.65×108 CFU g-1 spore powder) of B. bassiana, isolate IMI 389521 against unsexed adult LGB and the maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in Tanzania.

Mycotized millet grains with entomopathogenic fungi applied to soil of potted marigold plants was tested to target pupating thrips. Two experimental fungal isolates, (Beauveria bassiana [ARS7060] and Metarhizium anisopliae [ERL1171]), were compared with the registered B. bassiana strain GHA [commercialized as BotaniGard®] and untreated controls in greenhouse caged trials. Mycotized millet grains were mixed into the upper surface of the potting soil in pots of flowering ‘Hero Yellow’ marigolds (4 g/pot). One week after application five mated WFT females were released onto each plant (four plants per cage). At 8 wks post-infestation, the mean total number of thrips per plant was 81 and 90% less in the ERL1171 and ARS 7060 treatments,

Intracellular obligate parasitism results often in extreme adaptations, whose evolutionary history are difficult to understand, because intermediate forms are hardly ever found. Microsporidia belong to an early-diverging clade of fungi, which evolved extreme physiologic and genomic simplification as well as exceptionally high rates of molecular evolution. They possess the smallest eukaryotic genomes with very few introns, short intergenic regions and bacterial-sized ribosomal genes. As observed in other eukaryotic intracellular parasites, mitochondria in microsporidia have degenerated into small double-layered organelles called mitosomes, which have lost the genome and cannot produce ATP anymore. Instead, they steal it from their hosts. We describe the evolutionary history of a gut parasite of the crustacean Daphnia with remarkable morphological similarity to the microsporidia, but genomic features of ancient fungi. This parasite, which we formally name Mitosporidium daphniae gen. et sp. nov., possesses mitochondria, genes for oxidative phosphorylation and an infection apparatus typical for microsporidia. Phylogenomics places M. daphniae together with the microsporidia in a clade that also includes the most ancient fungi, the Cryptomycota. Comparative genomics further supports the missing link status of M. daphniae highlighting both its microsporidian and fungal like characteristics, and reveals the intermediate evolutionary steps that led to extreme metabolic simplification. The new species demonstrates that the extreme reduction in energy metabolism genes as well as the loss of introns in microsporidia was preceded by a reduction in the machinery controlling cell cycle, DNA recombination, repair and gene expression that may have contributed to the characteristically accelerated rate of microsporidia evolution..

that the following traits could be treated as plesiomorphic among microsporidia: paired nuclei, meiosis, division by internal budding (endoplygeny), short or anisofilar polar filaments, and sequence producing thick-walled environmental cysts. Metchnikovellidean spores possess short polar filaments (manubria) and likely do exploit the mechanism of dispersion via everting the polar tube with the attached sporoplasm, the major synapomorphy of Microsporidia. At the same time metchnikovellidan spores are devoid of most elements of the extrusion apparatus: a polaroplast, posterior vacuole, rigid spore wall, and long polar filament connected with a polar disc. The minimal apparatus of metchnikovellids may allow dissemination only within one cell (autoinvasion), whereas production of thick-walled cysts enables horizontal transmission of spores among hosts. .

More than 150 years of Microsporidia research led to a basic understanding of many aspects of microsporidial biology, yet little is known about the genetic basis and molecular mechanisms of the intimate host-parasite relationship that govern Microsporidia infections. Genetic model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster are relevant to the study of human infectious disease as most disease-associated genes have homologues in the fly genome. The knowledge about D. melanogaster host defense against obligate intracellular parasites remained, however, particularly patchy for lack of good infection models. A few years ago, a strain of Tubulinosema ratisbonensis infested our laboratory fly cultures and led us to model Microsporidia infections in Drosophila. Thus, we developed the first infection model of parasitism by a eukaryotic intracellular parasite of Drosophila, T. ratisbonensis. A unique feature of the Drosophila model is that we have developed infection models both in permissive cell lines and in adults. In addition, we have identified several nonpermissive cell lines that will allow us to identify some host defense genes. The ease to move from insights gained at the cellular level from Drosophila cell cultures to the whole-organism level using transgenic techniques will allow gaining an in-depth understanding of the biology of Microsporidia in flies, especially when combined with multi-‘omics' and functional genomic approaches that we have started to implement. This infection system provides thus novel opportunities to understand the mechanisms underlying microsporidiosis in other invertebrate such as bees and vertebrates hosts and may hopefully lead to novel concepts relevant to parasitology.

Family Metchnikovellidae (Class Rudimicrosporea Sprague 1977) seemingly a basal taxon of Microsporidia, remains understudied. We present data on ultrastructure of two species of metchnikovellids infecting lecudinid gregarines from polychaetes Pygospio elegans sampled in the White Sea silt littoral zone. The first species, Metchnikovella incurvata, Caullery and Mesnil was described in 1914, the second, M. spiralis -- only recently (Sokolova et al., in press). The two species have similar structure of free spores, vary in intracellular development, and produce dissimilar spore sacs (cysts). The cysts of the latter species exhibit unusual morphology: they are limited by a thick electron dense wall, externally ornamented with spirally wound cords of dense material. Basing on comparison of fine morphology and life cycles of metchnikovelllids and other microsporidia, I believe

It would be more than 50 years before another treatise would be produced, “Biology of Microsporidia” in 1976 and Systematics of the Microsporidia” in 1977 by Vavra and Sprague. This would remain the “go to” authority on the microsporidia until 1999 when “The Microsporidia and Microsporidiosis” was published containing chapters on microsporidia in vertebrate and invertebrate hosts and the first comprehensive review of the growing field of molecular biology and phylogeny of the microsporidia. With the field rapidly advancing in many aspects of basic and molecular biology of the microsporidia it was apparent that a revision and expansion of the previous volume was needed. This effort has resulted in the Microsporidia: Pathogens of Opportunity L.M. Weiss and J., J. Becnel (Eds.)

Wheat and maize are major crops in Switzerland. As part of a research consortium that explores ways to improve soil health, we study how entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) can be better exploited for the biological control of soil-dwelling insect pests. We evaluated the impact of different agricultural management practices on native EPN populations in two 30years Swiss field trials. One experiment compared tillage versus no-tillage and monoculture (wheat) versus crop rotation (maize), whereas the second studied four levels of tillage in two soil types planted with wheat. Soil samples were taken in April and in October 2013 (n = 88). Total nematode activity, as recorded with the Galleria-bait technique was <5%, with no significant effect of the treatments. Real time qPCR revealed that >95% of infected cadaver contained a mix of EPN with the competing Acrobeloides -group and/or Oscheius sp. The available molecular probes identified and quantified 13 organisms from soil, comprising six nematophagous fungi (NF), ectoparasitic bacterium, two free-living nematodes (FLN), and four EPNs (the evaluation of an additional ten EPN species is ongoing). In general, only trace levels of EPN were detected in all soils. Heterorhabditis spp. were the dominant EPN, with H. bacteriophora being significantly reduced by tillage (P<0.001). Monoculture favored the competitors of EPN (P<0.01). The abundance of EPN, NF and FLN was positively correlated (P<0.05). Since only low numbers of EPN are naturally present in Swiss agricultural soils, an augmentation strategy may help to improve the control of root pests of wheat and maize.

Biocontrol and nutrition: understanding the role of environment in the trait deterioration of an entomopathogenic nematode symbiont
Dana Blackburn, Burke Crawford, and Byron Adams Brigham Young University, Provo, UT USA
Address for Correspondence: blackbud84@gmail.com
Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs; genera Heterorhabditis and Steinernema) kill their invertebrate hosts with the aid of a mutualistic bacterium. The bacteria (Xenorhabdus spp. for steinernematids and Photorhabdus spp. for heterorhabditids) are primarily responsible for killing the host and providing the nematodes with nutrition and defense against secondary invaders. EPNs are amenable to laboratory rearing and mass production for biocontrol applications against insects; however,

EPNs and their symbiotic bacteria exhibit trait deterioration or changes due to laboratory rearing. The overall goal of this project is to understand how virulence in the nematodesymbiont Photorhabdus has evolved in an in vitro environment and the role nutrition plays in this process. Nutritional effects in trait deterioration were determined using monoxenic cultures of a freshly isolated strain of P. luminescens subsp. luminescens where base populations were compared with bacteria that were sub-cultured repeatedly to determine fitness loss. Trait stability was monitored in three different liquid media that are frequently used in laboratory culture: Liquid Lipid Medium, nutrient broth, and trypic soy both + 0.5% yeast extract. Subpopulations were compared to base populations for inclusion bodies after 5,15, and 20 liquid growth cycles (of 48 hours each). Additionally, growth curves and LT50 values were determined for the base and deteriorated populations. Differences were observed among the media types and the base/deteriorated populations. Understanding nutritional effects on important biocontrol traits may aid in more efficient methods of mass production.

Insect-killing nematodes also kill competitors: lethal malemale fighting in Steinernema
Annemie Zenner, Kathryn O’Callaghan and Christine Griffin Department of Biology, National University of Ireland Maynooth, Ireland Address for Correspondence: Christine.griffin@nuim.ie
Steinernema spp are well-known as entomopathogenic nematodes. We have found that males of certain species fight and kill each other, and that killing is influenced by the developmental pathway followed. The transmission stage of Steinernema is an infective juvenile (IJ) analogous to the dauer juvenile of Caenorhabditis elegans. IJs seek out and enter living insects in soil. Inside the insect they release symbiotic bacteria (Xenorhabdus spp.) which proliferate and digest the host tissues. This provides a rich nutritive medium for the developing nematodes, which reproduce in the host cadaver. A large host may support several generations of nematodes, and thus represents a valuable resource, worth competing for. In Steinernema longicaudum, males of the founding generation (those developing from IJ) fight by wrapping their tail ends around each others’ bodies and squeezing. Victims may appear paralysed within minutes of such an encounter, and frequently die. Worms that develop within the host cadaver in second or later generations develop directly, without passing through the IJ stage. For such worms, the benefits of fighting (the quality of the resource) is diminishing, while the large number of rivals present means that the benefits of killing do not necessarily accrue to males that kill. We have found that males that develop directly, without passage through the IJ stage, are much less likely to fight than those that do, and that this appears to be a developmental effect rather than a response to conditions at the time of fighting. .

Life history traits (LHTs) of Steinernema feltiae and S. riobrave were assessed at 25°C using a hanging drop technique. The LHTs were studied with 5 x, 10x and 20x 109 cells ml-1 of Xenorhabdus bovienii and X. cabanillasii for S. feltiae and S. riobrave, respectively, in semi-fluid nematode growth gelrite. The results indicated that increased food density had a significant positive influence on offspring production and net reproductive rate (R0) on both, S. feltiae and S. riobrave. Highest offspring production was recorded at bacterial food densities of 20 x109 cells ml-1 with 813/female for S. feltiae and 1,913 offspring/female for S. riobrave. Higher R0 values of 707 and 1,903 were recorded for S. feltiae and S. riobrave, respectively. A significant positive correlation between bacterial density and body volume that contributed to an increased offspring production was found in both species. The lowest intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm) (1.1 days) was recorded for S. feltiae and the highest (1.4) for S. riobrave. A population doubling time of PDT = 0.6 days was recorded for S. feltiae and 0.5 days for S. riobrave. The life span of female nematodes was not significantly different among the bacterial food densities tested. Significant differences in offspring production and population growth rate were recorded between the two species. The result can be used to further investigate the optimal bacterial food density for mass production in bioreactors for maximum DJ recovery in liquid bacterial suspension, synchronised population development and DJ yields of S. feltiae and riobrave.

Species determination in Entomopathogenic Nematodes of the genera Steinernema and Heterorhabditis is a very complex task, given the broad variability of both morphological and morphometric traits within a single species. To accomplish that, molecular techniques have been adopted which however require additional knowledge. Particularly relevant would be the possibility of testing in a reliable way the variability between different populations of the same species, which might represent different strains with different biological properties. Aim of our work was to determine if morphometric analysis, performed using the “Principal Component Analysis” approach, was able to get evidences of characters with significant diagnostic value, allowing to make reliable distinctions among strains. Four strains of Steinernema kraussei were found in Italy, three from Sicily and one from Alps (Tarasco et al., 2014;doi:10.1017/S0022149X14000194). Morphometric analysis of morphological traits commonly used in nematode taxonomy (referred to as variables) was done on 20 juveniles, males and females of first and second generations (or observations) belonging to three strains: 3D and PL (Sicily) and BT (Alps). Statistics was done by SIMCA package v.13. Up to three components were routinely computed; score plots, loading plots, X/Y overview and contribution plots were obtained. Our results showed that some of the morphometric variables employed could reliably be used to discriminate both juvenile and adult forms of PL strain, whereas an insufficient distinction could be made between BT and 3D.

We are studying the effects of plant domestication on belowground plant induced responses to herbivore feeding and how this affects entomopathogenic nematode (EPN) populations. In the New Jersey Pinelands, natural populations of highbush blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum) are commonly found adjacent to commercial fields of domesticated highbush blueberries. In a 3-year field study, we found that EPN were more prevalent but less diverse in cultivated fields than in natural stands. The dominant species in both habitats was Steinernema glaseri (Sg): numerous isolates of two distinct Sg strains were identified. In laboratory studies with oriental beetle (Anomala orientalis) larvae, the dominant rootfeeder in cultivated fields, Sg blueberry isolates were less virulent than the Sg NC strain, and strains from cultivated fields tended to be more virulent than those from natural stands. We are using the same Sg strains in laboratory and field studies on EPN attraction to blueberry roots as affected by oriental beetle feeding. Ongoing studies suggest that Sg is attracted more strongly by damaged roots. We have yet to identify any herbivore induced plant volatile (HIPV) responsible for enhanced attraction. A comparison of 2 known HIPVs emitted from roots in other systems suggests that (E)-β-caryophyllene is more attractive than pregeijerene.

Population genetic structure of entomopathogenic nematodes is still poorly understood even though such knowledge could help us to assess stability and vulnerability of natural EPN populations. Molecular markers used in EPN taxonomy and phylogeny (ITS and LSU regions of rDNA, NAD4, COII) are too conservative to be used to assess within species variability. So far only few studies attempted to use AFLP method to investigate EPN intra-population variability. In present study, microsatellite markers for Steinernema affine were developed. In total 218 bioinformatically validated pairs of primers for various oligonucleotides were obtained. Thirty most promising oligonucleotides were selected and tested for the use in the study of the species’ population genetic structure. Markers showing variability were identified and examined in various populations of S. affine, collected mainly in the area of South Bohemia..

are characterized by NPV epizootics at high density. We manipulated food quality, food quantity and the presence of phylloplane bacteria in the parental generation and measured the impact on immunity and resistance to NPV in the offspring. The treatments, particularly the foliar treatments, had clear impacts on the disease resistance of the offspring generation: however, not necessarily in the direction predicted. We discuss these data in relation to how changing levels of susceptibility could influence population cycles in these forest insects.

The parasitic nematode Deladenus siricidicola is widely used for the biological control of the invasive pine-killing woodwasp, Sirex noctilio. The nematode has a unique life cycle where it lives in pine trees, feeding on the symbiotic fungus of S. noctilio, the basidiomycete white rot fungus Amylostereum areolatum. In the presence of S. noctilio larvae, however, the nematode develops into a parasitic form which invades the woodwasp larvae, ultimately leading to sterilization of the host. The fungal-feeding stage of the nematode is used to commercially mass produce it for biological control programs. Previous studies investigating the effect of A. areolatum strain on D. siricidicola reproduction suggested the possibility of a role reversal where the fungus could eat the nematode. The present study examined the relationships between three species of Deladenus nematodes and their associated Amylostereum fungi. For D. siricidicola and A. areolatum, we hypothesized that significantly fewer nematode eggs placed in petri dishes containing potato dextrose agar medium would hatch in the presence of A. areolatum fungus than in control petri dishes with no fungus. Results supported this hypothesis. Additionally, light microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, and cryogenic scanning electron microscopy were used to show the ability of both A. areolatum and a second species, A. chailletii, to penetrate nematode eggs and adult living females of three species of Deladenus nematodes.

When population density increases, insects experience a number of stresses as a result of crowding including alteration in food quality and quantity. These changes have been shown to alter the resistance of insects to pathogens. Previous studies have tended to investigate the impact of these factors individually: however, in nature density-related factors are likely to interact simultaneously. While changes that occur within a single generation have been well documented, we know less about the transgenerational impact of changes in food quality on disease resistance. We tested the impact and interaction of three factors that are likely to occur in insect populations when density rises using the western tent caterpillar, Malacosoma californicum pluviale. Western tent caterpillars exhibit population cycles every 8-11 years, which

The Cydia pomonella granulovirus (CpGV) (Baculoviridae, genus Betabaculovirus) is a worldwide used biological agent to control the infestation of pome fruits by codling moth (C. pomonella L.). In 2005, first CM field populations resistant to commercial CpGV products containing the isolate CpGV-M (so-called Mexican isolate) were discovered in Europe. These resistant CM populations showed 1,000 – 100,000fold reduced susceptibility to CpGV-M when compared to normally susceptible CM populations. Infection experiments with isolates from different geographical origins showed that various CpGV isolates were able to overcome CM resistance in the genetically homogenous resistant laboratory CM strain. Molecular analysis of these resistance overcoming isolates (I12, -I07, -S, and -E2) showed that the only genomic difference, which all resistance overcoming isolates have in common, is a single common 24 nucleotide indel mutation coding for eight amino acids within the immediate-early gene pe38. Phylogenetic analyses presume that this mutation is an insertion within the genome of CpGV-M. Therefore, the role of pe38 in overcoming the resistance of CM was analyzed by constructing knockout and rescue pseudoviral mutants based on a CpGV-M bacmid. According to the source of pe38, we could show that the pseudoviruses are infective against susceptible larvae only - in the case of pe38 from CpGV-M - or against both susceptible and resistant larvae - in the case of pe38 from CpGV-S. Therefore, we conclude that pe38 is not only an essential factor for the infectivity of CpGV but also the key factor in overcoming CpGV resistance in CM.

In resistant codling moth larvae, CpGV-M replication is blocked at an early step in all tissues. Among others, the CpGV-R5 isolate is able to overcome this resistance. A genetically heterogeneous virus population, containing 1% CpGV-R5, and

99% CpGV-M has been used to infect non permissive host populations. Unexpectedly, this mixture, and the OBs recovered from killed larvae performed 100 times and 2000 times better than CpGV-M used alone, respectively. qPCR analysis using specific markers for each viral isolate was performed. The viral mixture CpGV-R5, 1%, and 99% of CpGV-M was amplified on permissive (CpNPP) and nonpermissive (RGV) populations and their offspring was tested for their respective proportion of each kind of marker. On permissive host, the R/M markers ratio raised to 15/85. On resistant host, a similar R/M ratio (12/88) was obtained, indicating that CpGV-M has been able to perform a complete replication cycle in a non-permissive host. These results suggest that in the presence of a small proportion of CpGV-R5, CpGV-M is able to replicate in resistant hosts. Accordingly, CpGV-R5 seems to act as a helper for CpGV-M genomes. Understanding the mechanism involved in the unlocking of the replication process opens the possibilities of innovative control strategies.

Recent studies have demonstrated that transmission of Spodoptera exigua multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeMNPV) parents to offspring (vertical transmission) is frequent and could contribute to biological control of this pest by causing viral mortality in the pest population in susccessive cropping cycles. The aim of this work was to study the efficacy of using mixtures of two SeMNPV genotypes that had either high insecticidal properties (SeG25) or the capability to be transmitted through host generations (SeAl1). Mixed populations containing 25 and 75% of SeG25 resulted in increased pathogenicity (LC50) compared to the SeAl1 genotype. However in terms of virulence (mean time to death) and productivity (OBs/larva), no differences were observed between the individual genotypes or their mixtures. The capacity to induce persistent infections by each genotype and their mixtures was evaluated using qPCR (DNA-polymerase gene) in adult survivors of a sublethal dose of the virus. The prevalence of covert infection varied between 70 and 100% in adults that survived inoculation with the vertically transmitted genotpype Se-Al1. The adult survivors to the mixtures and the SeG25 genotype alone are currently being analyzed to determine covert infection. Finally, field trials were carried out to evaluate the capacity of mixed virus populations to establish covert infections in greenhouse conditions. Adults developed from larvae collected in experimental plots sprayed with either single genotypes or one of the mixtures 75%Al1+ 25%G25 (75:25) and 25%Al1 +75%G25 (25:75) are being processed currently. The F1 offspring from adult survivors of SeAl1, 75:25, 25:75, SeG25 and control treatment did not showed differential susceptibility to a 25:75 mixture of OBs. The implications of these findings will be discussed.

Viral covert infections in invertebrates have been traditionally attributed to sublethal infections that did not reach enough viral titer to establish an acute infection. Recent studies are revealing that, although true for some viruses, other viruses may follow the strategy of establishing covert or persistent infections without producing the death of the host. In the last years, a large number of viruses causing covert infections in all type of hosts have been identified, mostly due to the revolution in the sequencing technologies. The beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a worldwide pest that causes significant loses to agricultural and ornamental plant industries. A comprehensive transcriptome analysis of the larval stage of S. exigua revealed the presence of an important number of unigenes belonging to novel RNA viruses, most of them from the order Picornavirales. In order to characterize S. exigua viral complex, we have completed the genomic sequences of three picorna-like viruses, two of them representing new members of the family Iflaviridae and a third one defining a new family. Additional studies have been performed to determine their morphology, infectivity, tissue distribution and abundance in the larval hosts. Influence of these viruses on the insect fitness as well as their effect on other viral and bacterial entomopathogens used for the control of this pest is also discussed.

A novel mode of resistance of codling moth against Cydia pomonella granulovirus

Julius Kühn-Institut, Darmstadt, Germany Address for Correspondence: Annette.Sauer@jki.bund.de
The codling moth (CM, Cydia pomonella) is one of the most devastating pests in nearly all pome fruit growing regions. An alternative to the application of chemical insecticides is the application of Cydia pomonella granulovirus (CpGV) (family Baculoviridae), which is registered as biological control agents in 34 countries worldwide. Since 2005, CM populations with a reduced susceptibility to CpGV products have been reported from about 40 plantations in seven European countries. For many of these CM populations, the resistance could be traced back to a single, dominant allele that is linked to the sex chromosome Z. CpGV-M, the so-called Mexican isolate, was the common agent used in all commercial CpGV products registered in Europe. Currently, resistance management strategies are based on the application of improved CpGV products, containing resistance-overcoming isolates. However, a CM field population, termed NRW-WE showed even resistance to most resistance overcoming CpGV isolates, suggesting a second mode of CpGV resistance. In order to elucidate the inheritance of this type of resistance and after failure of single crossing experiments, successive mass crossings under virus pressure were carried out to establish a genetically homogenous resistant strain of the CM population NRW-WE. Subsequent reciprocal crossing experiments with the resulting CM strain and a susceptible laboratory CM strain (CpS) followed by bioassays fitted to a dominant but autosomal inheritance model. Further analyses of the mode of resistance are under way. .

False codling moth (FCM), Thaumatotibia leucotreta is a major citrus pest in South Africa. Cryptophlebia leucotreta granulovirus (GrleGV-SA) has been found to be a successful biological control agent for FCM. South Africa grows citrus in many different geographical areas throughout the country that experience different temperature differences; this in turn could affect the efficiency of the virus upon the larvae. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the virus on larvae at temperatures ranging between 15-35°C. Unpaired Ttests, one-way ANOVA tests and post-Hoc Tukey’s HSD tests were conducted on both virus and control treatments to test for significant differences among different temperatures as well as between the virus and control treatments. The number of deaths between infected and control treatments were significantly different at all temperatures. The differences between treatment mortality times were significantly different for all infection stages except the final death stage (5th stage). The virus was found to be most efficient at higher temperatures since the larvae grow faster at higher temperatures. The virus was found to have very little effect at 15°C. These results should assist with the control of FCM in citrus orchards, and in particular would affect the timing of applications, to ensure that the virus is used at its maximum efficiency.

Enhancement of insecticidal activity of a nucleopolyhedrovirus isolated from Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) by

Spodoptera frugiperda is a polyphagous pest with wide geographical distribution. Biological control of this pest has included the use of its nucleopolyhedrovirus SfMNPV, which has shown high potential as biopesticide with efficacies higher than 80% but with some disadvantages related with cost production and time of action. In this sense, other viruses as betabaculovirus (GV) may act as synergists, increasing the insecticidal activity of NPVs. In this work, a Colombian granulovirus isolated from S. frugiperda larvae (VG008) was mixed with two different NPVs samples, one corresponding to a wild virus NPV003 and other corresponding to a pure genotype variant obtained from NPV003 (NPV003-A). Each mixture was evaluated in different proportions and in five different concentrations since 1 x 104 OB/mL to 1 x 108 OB/mL. For each mixture, the median lethal concentration (LC50) and mean time of mortality (MTM) were determined by laboratory bioassay in second instar larvae of S. frugiperda. Majority of mixtures between the VG008 and NPV003 showed a higher biological activity compared with each individual isolate, confirming the coinfection enhancement effect. The mixture corresponding to 2.5% of VG008 and 97.5% of NPV003, showed the highest enhancement of the NPV insecticidal activity with a decrease of 9.92 times in the LC50 and 4 days (96 hours) in the MTM. This virus mixture was selected and will be used as an active ingredient for the development of a new biopesticide based on both viruses in order to improve NPV efficacy for controlling the pest in the field.

Genetic markers have proved useful for assessing taxonomy and identifying specific-strains of entomopathogenic fungi. We targeted Beauveria bassiana commercial strain, GHA to develop a new reliable, simple, specific, sensitive and cost effective method that allows specific detection and discrimination of GHA from other Beauveria strains. We applied a combination of software with intrinsic manipulations to design GHA strain-specific primers by exploiting available Bloc nuclear intergenic sequences of GHA and other Beauveria strains. The generated primers were used in PCR assays to probe strains of B. bassiana (50), Beauveria pseudobassiana (13), Beauveria bronginiartii (3), Beauveria amorpha (2), Beauveria vermiconia (2), Beauveria asiatica, Beauveria australis, Beauveria kipukae, Beauveria malawiensis, Beauveria sungii and Beauveria varroae. In the specificity test, we amplified the expected target gene and ~ 300-bp-fragment from B. bassiana, GHA DNA. All other tested strains/isolates reacted negatively with the exception of four out of fifty B. bassiana strains that produced positive signals. In addition, the designed primers were highly sensitive; capable of detecting ~20 pg/µl of GHA genomic DNA. For operational feasibility, the newly designed marker would be used for studying the ecology, persistence and monitoring autodissemination of post-released GHA in the environment. To date, our methodology and associate protocol could be considered the simplest with high sensitivity and specificity, and most cost effective strategy for strain-specific marker design in the highly heterogeneous Beauveria species complex. Our approach provides a general framework that can be readily or easily adapted for designing strain-specific markers targeting any organism of choice.

The biocontrol potential of filamentous entomopathogenic fungi, such as Beauveria bassiana, depends not only on the virulence of a candidate strain to target pests but also on its tolerance to high temperature and solar UV irradiation often encountered in the field. The stress of UV, heat, drought, or

chemical may induce the production of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause damages to most biomolecules such as DNA, protein, and lipids. Fungal superoxide dismutases (SODs) that detoxify superoxide anions could be putative virulence factors for entomo-pathogenic fungi. Three genes encoding SODs have been identified in the Beauveria bassiana: a cytoplasmic Cu/ZnSOD (BbSod1), a mitochondrial FeSOD (BbSod4) and a cell-wall Cu/ZnSOD (BbSod5). During growth, BbSod4 was weakly expressed compared with other SODs and the deletion of BbSod4 was lethal. To probe their effects on the biocontrol potential of B. bassiana, ΔBbSod1, ΔBbSod5 and three hairpin RNA-interfered (RNAi) mutants were constructed and assayed for various phenotypic parameters in conjunction with ΔBbSod1/ BbSod1, ΔBbSod5/ BbSod5 and wild-type (control strains). The knockout mutants showed phenotypic alterations, including delayed sporulation and impaired conidial quality, but little change in RNAi mutants. Their mycelia or conidia became more sensitive to menadione or H2O2 induced oxidative stress but had little change in resistance to hyperosmolarity and wet-heat stress. Their UV tolerance and virulence was also impaired. Transcriptional changes of five Sod genes and other relative genes described try to explain the phenotypic changes among the mutants. Our finding highlight that these three Sods regulate the oxidative resistance in different method, thereby exerting profound effects on the fungal biocontrol potential.

Have entomopathogenic fungi phylloplane isolates any advantage over soil isolates in terms of environmental competence and virulence?. To address this question, 20 Beauveria bassiana isolates from soil and phylloplane of two holm oak ecosystems in Southern Spain pathogenic to medfly Ceratitis capitata adults and belonging to different type sequences and genotypes as interfered from EF-1α, Bloc and microsatellites were selected and their comparative response to temperature, water activity and UV.-B investigated. Effect of temperature on germination and colony growth rate was monitored in the range of 15-35ºC, with optimum temperature ranging from 23.8-28.7 ºC. All isolates showed maximum germination values between 1 and 0.996 water activity (aw). Germination at aw values lower than 0.928 were not observed for any isolate. Moreover, conidia were exposed to different irradiances (920 and 1200 mWm-2) during 2, 4 and 6 hours, and germination, culturability and mycelia growth were evaluated. These results show that a "recovery" of the fungal propagules could occur after being exposed to UV-B, even if such recovery is lower for longer exposure times (6h) and irradiance (1200 mWm-2). Therefore, the answer may be now addressed: the fungus isolation habitat does not always provide advantage in terms of environmental competence.

Strains of insect pathogenic fungi within the genus Metarhizium have increasingly been developed for the control of pest species. Risk assessment studies are a prerequisite before the fungus can be registered as a plant protection product. In this work we determined the risks posed by preparations of secreted metabolites and viable conidia to two aquatic, ecological toxicity indicator species, Artemia salina and Daphnia pulex. Organic solvents (OS) are normally used to extract the metabolites but they pose a risk to human health and the environment. Nanofiltration (NF) is an environmentally responsible technology that can be used to extract the metabolites as an alternative to the OS. Since risk assessment of each secondary metabolite produced by EPF could be a long and expensive process, the RAFBCA-REBECA decision scheme proposes evaluation of the risks posed by crude extracts. Therefore, three fungal strains (BIPESCO5, ARSEF 4556, and ARSEF 3297) were produced in three different culture media [Czapek-dox + peptone, Czapek-dox + yeast, and 10:1 (C:N ratio)], and their metabolites extracted by OS and NF methods. The chromatographic profiling of all the products was determined and their toxicity tested against A. salina and D. pulex. Concomitantly, the pathogenicity of the strains was tested against these non-target arthropods. At a relatively high dose (108 conidia ml-1), the conidia could cause 69% and 75% mortality in A. salina and D. pulex respectively. Both arthropods were sensitive to metabolites. Mortality depended on the fungal strain, extraction method, and test organism. Our study showed that A. salina and D pulex mortality was due to the combination of Metarhizium conidia induced stress as well as secreted metabolites.

The main secondary metabolites produced by the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium brunneum are destruxins (dtxs), cyclic hexadepsipeptides, which exhibit a wide variety of biological activities. Overall they are best known for their insecticidal and phytotoxic activities. Since the fungus is used for biological control of insect pests there are some concerns regarding whether the produced secondary metabolites entail risks to humans and the environment. To asses if the major secondary metabolites secreted by M. brunneum enter the food chain a two-step sample preparation protocol, consisting of the sample extraction by the QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) method followed by the sample purification by offline solid phase extraction on a reversed phase material was established. For the analysis and quantification of dtx congeners a fast and selective UHPLC-DAD/TOF-MS method based on a previously developed method was optimized. It

Entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana is a mycoinsecticide against arthropod pests. Three -1, 2mannosyltransferase proteins (Ktrp) named Bbktr1, Bbktr4 and Bbkre2 are responsible for extension of the second and third mannose residues on secretory protein. Here, we characterized the role of three Ktrp in B. bassiana and found that they were positive, but differential, regulators of the growth, conidiation, multi-stress tolerance and virulence of the entomopathogenic fungus. The three disruptions accompanied with their corresponding complement ΔBbktr1/ktr1, ΔBbktr4/ktr4, ΔBbkre2/kre2 and wild-type were constructed. ΔBbktr4 and ΔBbkre2 grew 5083% slower on nutrition-rich and limited media while ΔBbktr1 show similar colony sizes on all the tested media. Their conidial yields on a standard medium were reduced by 3196%, accompanied with abnormal germination. All the mutants became significantly less tolerant to most stresses of cell wall perturbation, high osmolarity, oxidation, wet heat and UV-B irradiation during colony growth. Furthuremore, the Ktrp mutants were altered in cell wall structure and composition, which contributed to the thickness of cell wall, increased sensitivity to lyase, the low conidial hydrophobicity and cell surface carbohydrate epitopes. Coincidentally, the attenuated cell wall in Ktrp mutants also brought out the more protoplast to release. Remarkably, insect bioassays revealed decreased virulence in ΔBbktr4, ΔBbkre2 for 18% and 1.2-fold with topical application, and 31% and 26% with intrahemoceol injection. Our findings revealed that Ktrp plays a central regulatory role in B. bassiana.

typographus) have huge economic and ecological impacts in conifer forests worldwide. Just in the last 25 years the spruce bark beetle has killed millions of cubic meters of Norway spruce (Picea abies) in Europe. Trees are killed by a combination of pheromone-mediated mass-attacks and infection with phytopathogenic bluestain fungi vectored by the beetles. Ceratocystis polonica, the most virulent fungal associate of the spruce bark beetle, can kill healthy trees in the absence of beetle attack if it is experimentally inoculated into the bark at high densities. Norway spruce protects itself against combined beetle-fungus attacks by multiple preformed and inducible defense mechanisms. Structurally diverse mixtures of mono-, sesqui- and diterpenes are central components of these defenses. Preformed terpenes stored in resin ducts in the bark and sapwood may repel or inhibit initial attacks. Terpene levels increase tremendously following induction by e.g. fungal infection or application of methyl jasmonate (a defense-inducing plant hormone). This induced terpene response reduces pheromone emission by the spruce bark beetle and inhibits tree colonization in a dose-dependent manner. However, fungal associates of the spruce bark beetle can greatly reduce monoterpene levels in the tree by biotransforming them to oxygenated monoterpenes. In addition, the fungi also produce different metabolites which may play multiple roles in bark beetle host finding and colonization. These observations demonstrate the complicated interactions between conifer-bark beetle-fungi.

The larvae of soil dwelling insects use carbon dioxide gradients, established by growing roots, to orientate towards their host plants. This long distance orientation cue is complemented by other volatile cues to finally accept a host plant for feeding. Previous application strategies using entomopathogenic fungi for soil pest control were using high concentrations of spores per m2, set against competing microorganisms in the rhizosphere. In the attract and kill approach the strategy is turned upside down: larvae voluntarily make their way to the spores, contained in capsules emitting CO2. When near to these capsules, probability of larval infestation with spores is higher. However, to make this strategy work, the capsules need to fulfill several prerequisites, such as building up a gradient significantly higher than the background CO2 concentration in the soil, maintained for at least several weeks, and the larvae need to be attracted to the capsules to feed on them. In lab experiments we assessed the larval behavior of corn rootworms and wireworms towards these artificial CO2-capsules. Both pest larvae were attracted by the capsules, but only stayed for short periods at these sites. Thus, additional compounds need to be incorporated into these capsules to increase their attractiveness for the larvae. In German field experiments these capsules, combined with M. brunneum, were used in potato fields for wireworm control. Treatments resulted in significantly lower tuber damage in some, but not all fields. Necessary improvements of the attract and kill strategy for anapplication in the field are discussed.

Natural enemies like arthropods and entomopathogenic fungi both contribute to the natural regulation of pests in many crops. As arthropod natural enemies have evolved, they have become a part of a complex multitrophic system and they exist alongside species of entomopathogenic fungi. Some of these entomopathogenic fungi may actually also be a potential threat to arthropod natural enemies. Both arthropod predators and entomopathogenic fungi are important biological control agents of the two spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae in strawberry. Previous studies on the interactions between these two types of natural enemies show variable results in regards to synergistic/antagonistic effects. We speculated if the degree of specialization of the predator or the fungus could play a significant role. Therefor a behavioral study was conducted to investigate the searching and feeding time of predators (two species tested) in the presence of entomopathogenic fungal spores (two species tested). The predator species used in this study were the generalist predatory bug, Orius majusculus and the specialist predatory mite, Phytoseiulus persimilis. The entomopathogenic fungal species used was the generalist Metarhizium brunneum and the specialist Neozygites floridana. Predator behavior was recorded by observations in an experimental setup where the predator was given a choice between two strawberry leaf discs; one with entomopathogenic fungal spores and one without, and both with healthy T. urticae. Results suggest that searching and feeding times of both predator species was lower on leaf discs with presence of M. brunneum spores compared to no fungal spores. On leaf discs with N. floridana spores the searching time of both predators was higher compared to no fungal spores. O. majusculus spent more time feeding on prey on the leaf disc with spores of N. floridana than on leaf discs without spores, while P. persimilis spent less time feeding on the leaf discs with N. floridana spores, compared to leaf discs with no fungal spores. Results indicate that the degree of specialization of the beneficial organisms plays a role in the interaction between arthropods and entomopathogenic fungi. Such interactions are important to consider when biological control using several biological control agents is developed.

Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) disease affects cereals globally, and is caused by a range of toxigenic fungi from the genus Fusarium. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is most susceptible to FHB during flowering. The role of insect pests in FHB epidemiology is poorly understood, so the objective of this work was to determine the interactions between the most dominant FHB pathogen, Fusarium graminearum, and insect pests that

would co-localise on host plants. Grain aphids, Sitobion avenae, were used as they are known to colonise wheat ears during flowering. Wheat ears were treated with combinations of fungal inoculum and grain aphids transferred from either healthy or infected previous hosts. Ears treated simultaneously with F. graminearum inoculum and aphids incurred significantly higher disease severity, pathogen DNA and accumulation of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol than ears treated with F. graminearum inoculum alone. Olfactometer assays using headspace samples of volatiles from wheat ears inoculated with the pathogen showed that F. graminearum-induced volatiles were repellent to aphids. Chemicals responsible for repellency were identified via GC-linked electroantennography and GC-MS followed by olfactometer assays of the electrophysiologically active components. Furthermore, decreased fecundity and survival was observed for aphids fed with F. graminearum symptomatic ears. Aphid feeding increased disease progression, therefore benefitted the colonising pathogen, possibly by altering plant defence responses. However, disease induction negatively impacted on aphid survival and reproductive success. Exhibition of a repellent response by aphids to volatiles from diseased plants can be interpreted as an adaptation by aphids to evade the inhospitable enviroment created by the pathogen.

Plant-micro-organisms associations may play a role in shaping plant-herbivore interactions. Here, we tested whether the inoculation of a host-plant with a variety of microorganisms would be able to affect the attraction to the plant, the oviposition preference and the fitness of an herbivorous insect. We worked on the system of a phytophagous species (grapevine moth Lobesia botrana), its host plant (grapevine Vitis vinifera) and the microorganisms associated with the plant. In vineyards, L. botrana use a volatile signal to locate the host-plant from a distance and to oviposit on grape. In our experiments, the attraction from a distance and the oviposition preference of the moth were influenced by the microbial activity on the plant. In addition, the quality of the host plant as larval food was importantly changed by the presence of pathogenic or opportunistic microorganisms on the plant. Taken together our results indicated a major role of endemic microorganisms on L. botrana host-selection and life-traits. Microbial volatiles appear to be a major cue mediating this kind of interaction.

Virulence of the aphid-specific fungus Pandora neoaphidis, as

55

measured in dose-response assays, was compared against the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, that had been reared on different host plant species. A. pisum were reared on dwarf bean then inoculated with P. neoaphidis and returned to dwarf bean or inoculated and transferred to field bean, pea or lucerne. The smallest estimated median lethal concentration (LC50) was 7.7 conidia mm-2 for aphids returned to dwarf bean, with LC50s of 13.0 and 14.6 conidia mm-2 for aphids transferred to field bean or pea, respectively. The largest LC50 was achieved when aphids were transferred to lucerne: 2941.0 conidia mm-2. In a subsequent experiment, A. pisum were reared on either pea or dwarf bean for four generations before bioassays. The LC50 for aphids reared and incubated on dwarf bean was 7.3 conidia mm-2, compared to 13.3 and 15.3 conidia mm-2 when aphids were transferred between dwarf bean and pea, or pea and dwarf bean, respectively. The LC50 for aphids reared then incubated on pea plants was 27.9 conidia mm-2. Overall, the virulence of P. neoaphidis was greatest when A. pisum was reared and maintained on dwarf bean, the plant used for long-term routine culturing of the aphid. In conclusion, virulence of P. neoaphidis was influenced by host plant and particularly by the plant species to which the host aphid had become adapted. Plant resources may affect the population dynamics of P. neoaphidis and could result in a greater impact on aphid herbivores that are not suffering physiological stress related to a change in host plant.

Genome Biology Division, New EnglandBiolabs, Inc., Ipswich MA USA Address for Correspondence: slatko@neb.com
Most human filarial nematode parasites and arthropods are hosts for a bacterial endosymbiont, Wolbachia. In filaria, Wolbachia are required for normal development, fertility and survival, whereas in arthropods, they are largely parasitic and can influence development and reproduction, but are generally not required for host survival. Due to their obligate nature in filarial parasites, Wolbachia have been a target for drug discovery initiatives using several approaches including diversity and focused library screening and genomic sequence analysis. In vitro and in vivo anti-Wolbachia antibiotic treatments have been shown to have adulticidal activity, a long sought goal of filarial parasite drug discovery. In mosquitoes, it has been shown that the presence of Wolbachia can inhibit the replication of certain viruses, such as Dengue, Chikungunya, Yellow Fever West Nile, and the infectivity of the malaria-causing protozoan, Plasmodium and filarial nematodes. Furthermore, Wolbachia can cause a form of conditional sterility that can be used to suppress populations of mosquitoes and additional medically important insects. Thus Wolbachia, a pandemic endosymbiont offers great potential for elimination of a wide-variety of devastating human diseases.

Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) are exposed to a range of cues in the soil. To the extent these cues are positively associated with the presence of insect hosts, one might hypothesize that EPN would respond positively to such cues. Decomposing animals release many different chemical compounds into the soil, attract large numbers of foraging insects, and produce large numbers of insect larvae. Thus, these chemical compounds may serve as an important cue for foraging EPN. We hypothesized the Steinernema feltiae and Steinernema glaseri IJs would respond generally positively to two particular compounds (putrescine and cadaverine) produced during animal cadaver decomposition. We further hypothesized that S. feltiae would respond more strongly to putrescine, and that S. glaseri would respond more strongly to cadaverine. We initially used standard agar-based “bulls-eye” attraction assays, and assessed S. feltiae and S. glaseri responses to diffusion discs soaked in 5 μl of 50, 100, 500, and 1000 μmol concentrations of each of the two compounds. We followed those agar trials with more realistic small sand column assays, assessing responses to the compounds when they were presented with additional stimuli such as host presence. On agar, responses differed between the different EPN species, chemical compounds, and concentrations, but the chemicals were never attractive and often strongly repellent. Responses were more complex in the sand columns; in particular, the compounds seem to attract more IJs to areas that also contained hosts.

Photorhabdus bacteria gain access to an insect host by their association with the free-living infective juvenile stage (IJ) of Heterorhabditis nematodes. Penetration of the insect can be achieved through three different portals of entry: a) digestive (mouth, anus), b) tracheal (spiracles) and c) integument. Studies have shown that Photorhabdus may colonize other tissues before they establish in the insect’s hemocoel, the final destination for full release of bacterial symbionts and completion of their life cycle. It is likely that Photorhabdus employs effectors related to virulence factors in pathogens for adhesion, invasion, and intracellular growth in its host’s cells. In this study we investigated tissue aggregations and virulence factors by measuring PirAB toxin expression of Photorhabdus luminescens (TT01) in different insect tissues and concurrent to different portals of entry used by their nematode hosts.

Xenorhabdus spp. has dual life styles: they are pathogenic to insects and mutualistic with Steinernema nematodes. The nematodes vector the bacteria from one insect to another. In return, bacteria provide a suitable environment in the insect cadaver for the nematodes to maturate and reproduce. Each Steinernema spp. carries one Xenorhabdus sp. Contrarily, a Xenorhabdus spp. may associate with more than one nematode host. The most promiscuous bacterium is X. bovienii, which associates with nine Steinernema spp. In this study, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of nine X. bovienii strains to depict novel virulence factors. Furthermore, virulence assays were performed considering three different lepidopteran hosts. Results revealed that four X. bovienii strains were attenuated, whereas the other five were virulent. The genomic platform MicroScope was used to identify known and candidate genes that contribute to their pathogenicity. Additionally, loci involved in their association with the nematodes were investigated. Two loci were identified as novel candidates involved in the bacterium’s ability to interact with both nematode and insect hosts. The first region appears to be specific to interactions with nematode partners. The second region contains a type six secretion system (T6SS), which is known to contribute to bacterial pathogenicity. We hypothesize T6SS may contribute to the bacterium’s ability to cause death in a wide range of insect hosts. Further molecular studies are undergoing to expand our understanding on the role of these loci and their mode of action in the dual lifestyle of this bacterium.

Entomopathogenic bacteria of the genera Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus live in symbiosis with nematodes of the genera Steinernema and Heterorhabditis, respectively, and together they are able to infect and kill several different insect larvae. We have shown recently by chemical analysis and genome sequencing that these bacteria are able to produce a huge variety of different low molecular weight natural products. These compounds show insecticidal but also antibiotic and anticancer activity and novel bacterial signalling compounds have also been identified. Recent work indicates that several of the bacterial natural products are addressing different parts of the insect immune system in order to make sure that the bacteria can evade it and kill the insect host. As the nematode immune system shows the same basic principles, it is of high interest how the natural products can differentiate between insect prey and nematode host. We will present our recent finding on natural products and their natural targets as well as ways to improve the production of these – probably also pharmaceutically useful – compounds.

Photorhabdus luminescens subsp. akhurstii LN2 (Enterobacteriaceae) is a symbiont of entomopathogenic nematodes Heterorhabditis indica LN2 and showed nematicidal activity against H. bacteriophora H06 infective juveniles (IJs). The LN2 bacteria may secrete unidentified toxic factors lethal for the H06 nematodes. The trans-specific nematicidal activity of the bacteria against the non-symbiotic nematode may have an impact on competitive interactions when one insect host is co-infected by different nematode species. To explore the molecular mechanism of the trans-specific nematicidal activity of P. luminescens LN2 against H. bacteriophora H06, the complete genome of P. luminescens LN2 was sequenced; two mutagenesis libraries of P. luminescens LN2 were constructed using Tn5 transposon and rifampicin antibiotic respectively; the mutants from the libraries were tested for nematicidal activity and mutants negative for nematicidal activity were genetically and proteomically characterized. At least 9 putative proteins including DsbA, HlpA, RhlE, RplC, RpoB, NamA, NamB (a protein from T3SS), and 2 hypothetical proteins (similar to unknown protein YgdH and YggE of Escherichia coli respectively) were involved in the nematicidal activity of LN2 bacteria against H06 nematodes. This hypothesis was further confirmed by creating insertion-deletion mutants of corresponding genes. It seems that a big network system is
involved in this nematicidal activity.

Erinnyis ello (L.) is a polyphagous lepidopteran pest that may cause serious annual losses in the rubber industry. The use of granulovirus represents an interesting alternative as a biological control agent for this insect. One Colombian granulovirus isolate (VG010) was obtained from E. ello larvae in the field and was characterized at morphological, biological and molecular level. Occlusion bodies showed an oval morphology with a unique nucleocapsid, and a size of 302.9 ± 22 x 181.5 ± 16 nm. The VG010 viral genome size was estimated to be approximately 88.7 kb. Phylogenetic relationships based on selected gene sequences lef-8, lef-9 and gran showed a close relationship between VG010 and another isolate from E. ello previously reported (M34-4), suggesting that these isolates are genotypic variants of the same viral specie. The mean lethal dose of VG010 against second instar E. ello larvae was 4.3 x 103 OBs/mL and the viral productivity ranged between 2.1 x 109 and 3.8 x 109 OBs/g of larval tissue. With this virus, a wettable powder formulation was

57

developed which photostabilized viral OBs against UVB radiation and improved shelf life. This product presented an efficacy of 99% for controlling the pest in laboratory and quality control limits for the product were established. This biopesticide constitutes a new tool with high quality and efficacy that needs to be scaled up and evaluated under field conditions in order to confirm its potential for controlling this important pest in rubber crops.

The codling moth (CM), Cydia pomonella (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is considered one of the most significant pests of apples and pears in the Western Cape, South Africa. Traditionally, control measures have relied heavily on the use of broad spectrum insecticides. Cydia pomonella granulovirus (CpGV) has proved to be an effective alternative to chemical application. The main objectives of this study were to identify a novel South African isolate of CpGV and to ascertain the viability and shortcomings of producing CpGV in the heterologous host, false codling moth (FCM), Thaumatotibia leucotreta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). Initially four field collected isolates were compared genetically to two commercially available products. PCR amplification and sequencing of CpGV granulin and egt genes as well as single restriction endonuclease digestion of genomic DNA isolated from purified occlusion bodies indicated that the South African isolates were genetically similar to the Mexican strain. A further two isolates have been collected from the Langkloof (Eastern Cape) and Harrismith (Free State) areas in which there is no previous record of commercial virus application. Genetic comparisons are currently being conducted. Initial results indicate genetic variation in the Harrismith isolate when compared to the Mexican strain. Rearing parameters for CM and FCM, including fecundity, percentage hatch, larval developmental times and percentage mortality, were compared. The quantity of CpGV per larval unit was calculated for both FCM and CM. Mortality and virus yields were assessed by inoculating early 4th and 5th instar larvae with eight concentrations of purified CpGV. The mortality data obtained from the virus yield trials were used to establish the concentrations required to conduct surface dose bioassays against both FCM larval larvae. Dose and time response values for 4th and 5th instar FCM larvae were determined and used in establishing a virus production technique. Effective quality control parameters have been established to ensure the integrity of virus being produced, namely bioassay, RE analysis using Hind III as there is no recognition site for this enzyme in CpGV DNA and, lastly, development of a set of standards for a qPCR reaction, which can be used to calculate the proportion of CpGV in a mixed virus solution. If this production technique was to be successfully implemented into a mass production programme the cost of producing CpGV could be significantly reduced.

Baculovirus oral infection is mediated by binding and fusing of occlusion derived virus (ODV) with the microvilli of midgut epithelium under alkaline condition. Previous studies showed that ODV attachment protein, P74, of Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) undergoes two sequential cleavage events, the primary one being conducted by the endogenous alkaline protease at an unidentified site and the secondary one by host midgut trypsin at amino acids R195/R196/R199. Here we report that Helicoverpa armigera single nucleopolyhedrovius (HearNPV) P74 was first cleaved after translation in the host cell and was not dependent on the endogenous protease during ODVs release. The cleavage produces two subunits which were not associated by disulfide bonding. Judging from the molecular mass of the subunits, the cleavage was predicted at an arginine and lysine (R/K) rich region in the middle of HearNPV P74. A series of site-directed mutants in this region were generated. Feeding experiments showed that the single or multiple mutations significantly impaired per os infectivity and mutagenesis of R334Q/R339Q/R344Q/R347Q eliminated the specific cleavage of HearNPV P74. A mutant of the proposed second cleavage site R220Q/R221Q/R224Q was also generated and bioassays showed that the region was essential for oral infection. The results suggested that although there are some differences during the first cleavage, P74 of both AcMNPV and HearNPV undergo two steps cleavage, and the cleavage sites are likely to be conserved in the two viruses. An integrated model of P74 cleavage is provided which sheds lights on the molecular mechanism of ODV entry.

The potato tuber moth, Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), is a major pest of solanaceous crops in sub-tropical and tropical regions worldwide. This pest has developed resistance to many traditional pesticides, thus alternate means of control are required to protect the R2.5 billion (€168 million) potato industry in South Africa. The Phthorimaea operculella granulovirus (PhopGV) is considered a promising biopesticide that can be incorporated into integrated pest management programmes. Several PhopGV isolates recovered from geographically different insect populations have been genetically characterised and the full

58

genome of the Tunisian PhopGV-1346 isolate has been sequenced, providing a reference strain for comparison with novel isolates. This study reports the identification and genetic characterisation of a South African PhopGV isolate recovered from a P. operculella colony reared in the laboratory. Sequencing of the lef-8, granulin and egt genes confirmed the identity of the virus as PhopGV. Phylogenetic analysis of egt sequences grouped PhopGV-SA together with the Kenyan and South American isolates. Virulence evaluation against P. operculella larvae using surface dose and egg dip methods are currently underway and the preliminary data indicate that the virus has potential for development as a biopesticide for control of the pest in both the field and storage.

The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lep, Plutellidae), is a serious world-wide pest of cruciferous crops, with a global estimated cost of control and damage amounting to approximately US$4–5 billion annually. The P. xylostella granulovirus (PlxyGV) is considered a promising alternative to synthetic chemical insecticides and Bt insecticidal proteins for control due to the development of resistance in pest populations. Several PlxyGV isolates have been genetically and biologically characterised although many of these have not been commercialised as bio-pesticides. This is the first study to describe a novel South African PlxyGV in terms of genotype and biological activity. PlxyGV was recovered from an overcrowded laboratory P. xylostella colony established using field-collected insects. Occlusion bodies (OBs) were extracted from diseased larvae and purified by glycerol gradient centrifugation. PlxyGV-SA was genetically characterised by restriction endonuclease (REN) analysis of genomic DNA, and PCR amplification and sequencing of granulin, ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt), late expression factor 8 (lef-8) and late expression factor 9 (lef-9) genes. Comparison of PlxyGV-SA REN profiles with those of PlxyGV-Japan (GenBank accession No. AF 270937.1) and other documented PlxyGV isolates together with sequence and alignment data showed that PlxyGV-SA is genetically unique. Neonate larvae were more susceptible to PlxyGV-SA infection than fourth instars at the same virus concentration. Biological activity determined by surface dose bioassays was estimated to be 3.56 × 105 OBs/ml (LC50), which is comparable with values obtained in similar studies. These results suggest that PlxyGVSA has significant potential for development as an effective biopesticide for the control of P. xylostella in the field.

Comparative transcriptome analysis of CpGV-M in susceptible and resistant codling moth Cydia pomonella

Heinrichstraße 243, 64287 Darmstadt, Address for Correspondence: Diana.Schneider@jki.bund.de
The Cydia pomonella granulovirus (CpGV) is commercially widely used and a cornerstone in the control of codling moth,

C. pomonella L. (CM), in both organic and integrated pome fruit production. Recently, nearly 40 CM populations resistant to products based on the Mexican isolate CpGV-M have been located in Europe. So far, new CpGV isolates overcoming this resistance were identified and are applied in orchards with resistant CM populations. However, only limited information on the infection process of CpGV is available. To gain a better understanding of the interaction between CpGV-M and its host microarray analyses of the transcription of CpGV-M genes in the midgut of susceptible and resistant CM individuals was performed. Therefore, CM larvae were infected with CpGV-M and RNA samples were taken from midguts between 0 and 120 h post infection. Microarray analysis of the susceptible CM strain resulted in a detailed overview of the temporal transcription of all 143 CpGV-M genes. Four representative gene clusters were identified by performing a k-means clustering. Some correlation between the promoter motif and the course of the infection pattern could be observed. Thereby, it was also possible to group uncharacterized CpGV-M genes according to their transcriptional profile. In contrast, a delayed and limited transcriptional activity of CpGV-M genes was observed in midguts of CM strains resistant to CpGV-M. This indicated that CpGV-M is able to enter the midgut in resistant CM and start the viral transcription. This truncated infection does not result in a permissive infection of the host. In addition, the transcription of the resistant CM strain infected with the resistance overcoming isolate CpGV-I12 was followed by qPCR to proof if a successful infection of a resistant CM strain leads to the same course of infection as seen as in susceptible CMs. Six representative genes (ie-1 lef-8, mcp, pe38, f-protein and granulin) were chosen for this analysis. All of them showed the same course of infection in the resistant CM strain as seen
in the susceptible CM strain.

Alphabaculoviruses (lepidopteran nucleopolyhedroviruses) have a characteristic physical structure that facilitates the transmission of genetic diversity. We demonstrate that coinfection of Spodoptera exigua larvae by SeMNPV and a deletion genotype of SfMNPV resulted in the production of mixed virus occlusion bodies (OBs) containing both the parental viruses. This also occurred when phylogenetically more distant viruses were used: SfMNPV and AcMNPV coinfections in S. frugiperda larvae also resulted in mixed virus species OBs. Approximately half the virions present in OBs produced following coinfection with mixtures of different alphabaculoviruses contained both viruses, indicating that the viruses coinfected and replicated in a single cell, and were coenveloped within the same virion. Serial passage experiments revealed that both viruses persisted in the mixed-virus population by coinfection of insects during several rounds of insect-to-insect transmission. These results have dramatic implications in alphabaculovirus evolution and ecology. This mixed virus production technology is the subject of a PCT (patent) and opens the way to the development of customdesigned insecticides for control of different species of caterpillar pests on crops.

Baculoviruses are sensitive to UV radiation and this characteristic causes the control efficacy of viral insecticides unsteady in the fileds. The polyhedron envelope of baculoviruses, which is composed of carbohydrate and phosphorylated protein (PEP), is the first barrier against the disadvantageous environment. We found that orthologs of Autographa colifornica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) PEP, such as Helicoverpa armigera nucleopoly-hedrovirus PEP, Cydia pomonella granulovirus Cp20 or Cp22 might not repair the absence of polyhedron envelope in the pep-knocked-out AcMNPV construct. The C-terminal (168~252aa) of AcMNPV PEP might deliever GFP to be expressed on the surface of polyhedron. Consequently, we had constructed the AcMNPV recombinants in which the C-terminal of PEP was fused with the peptides which might specifically bind melanin or nano-scale ZnO. These results may lay a foundation for developing intensive UV-resistant viral insecticides.

functions. The current model proposes that the TcA component binds to the cell surface and forms a pH-triggered channel that allows translocation of the TcBC subcomplex into the cytoplasm. Once in the cytoplasm the carboxy-terminus of the TcC subunit dissociates and becomes active, which causes toxicity in both insect and mammalian cells. A major component of this model is the requirement of an intact toxin complex in allowing TcBC to be transported into the cell. Based on our investigations of Yen-Tc, the YenBC subcomplex and the YenC subunit do not necessarily require full complex assembly to trigger cell toxicity. We will present and discuss our findings in relation to the current model.

A novel gram-negative, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming bacterium, Yersinia entomophaga MH96 (Enterobacteriaceae), was isolated from diseased larvae of the New Zealand grass grub, Costelytra zealandica (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae). Y. entomophaga produces a proteinaceous toxin complex (Yen-Tc) that is responsible for mortality in a range of insect species, mainly within the Coleoptera and Lepidoptera. The Yen-Tc is made up of two chitinase subunits (Chi1 and 2) and five Yen subunits (A1, A2, B, C1, and C2). The TcA, B, and C subunits are related to members of the Toxin complex (Tc) toxin family, with orthologs identified from several other bacterial species including Serratia entomophila and Photorhabdus luminescens. Characterization of Yen-Tc pathology has revealed a progressive deterioration of the midgut epithelium of susceptible insects. Although the specific mechanism of Yen-Tc remains unknown, cellular and molecular work has begun shedding light on how the Tc family

Bacillus thuringiensis larvicidal Cry toxins are currently known for their strong host specificity; which is mainly due the presence of specific toxin binding sites on midguts of susceptible insect larvae. Meanwhile Cry toxins can also bind to compounds in the peritrophic matrix (PM) of several insects (*Rees et al. 2009; Valaitis and Podgwaite 2013). In G. mellonella infected with toxin alone, we observed structural modification of the peritrophic matrix but no evidence for the biochemical explanation for this modification is found so far. Knowing that “mucus” is along with chitin the main components of PM and that mucus is commonly found in several organisms, we aim to investigate the capacity of Cry1Ab to bind to several mucus rich structures. Indeed, our hypothesis is that the heavily glycosylated proteins (peritrophins and mucins) and proteoglycans shared by both vertebrate and invertebrate mucus may bind Cry toxins, therefore questioning on the “specificity” of these toxins used in GMO crops. Using, commercial pork stomach mucins, mice intestinal mucus, vertebrate cell-culture mucus and PM and peritrophins from G. mellonella, we then deeply analyzed Cry1Ab-mucus interactions. The presentation will deal with results from far western blot studies, ELISA binding experiments, inhibition ELISA with sugars, lectins or antiCry1Ab monoclonal antibodies. Identification of the interacting structure by LC/Ms/Ms analysis and resulting toxicity using insect and cellular models will be also shown. *J Invertebr Pathol. 2009 Mar; 100(3):139-46; J Invertebr Pathol. 2013 Jan; 112(1):1-8.

By in vitro toxicity assay using Sf9/Baculovirus expression system, we previously provided a novel evidence that Bombyx

mori ABC transporter C2 (BmABCC2) functions as a receptor for Cry1A toxins. We also demonstrated that BmABCC2 can confer approximately 10-1000 times higher suscetibility to the cells than cadherin-like receptor (BtR175) and BmABCC2 and BtR175 co-expression exerts synergistic effect in susceptibility confering ability. This synergistic effect sugested that these two receptors have different roles in the mode of action of Cry1A toxins in Sf9. Thus, we addressed to find the difference in the roles of the two receptors. First, we evaluated pore formation helping ability of the receptors using xenopus oocyte expression system and the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique. When Cry1Aa or Cry1Ab toxin was administrated to BmABCC2 expressing oocytes, current continuasly increased during toxin incubation, indicating that pores were continuasly assembled on the cell mambrane. However, when BtR175 expressing oocytes were administrated with toxins current increment speed was lower than in BmABCC2 expressing oocytes, indicating that BtR175 has lower function than BmABCC2 in pore formation helping. In contrast, BmABCC2 and BtR175 co-expressing oocytes showed at least 4 times higher current increment speed than BmABCC2 single expressing oocytes. This indicates that synersism occurs at least in part in the pore formation process, although synergistic effect is very low in comparison to that seen in Sf9 expression sysytem. We also compared the binding affinity to Cry1A toxins of BmABCC2 and BtR175 using Biacore systems. We will discuss these results, too.

Several crystal (Cry) proteins are known to occur as DNAprotein complexes. However, the role of the DNA associated with the activated toxin in the mechanism of action of the Cry toxin has long been ignored. Here, we focused on the DNAactivated Cry toxin complex. Both forms of the Cry8Ca2 and Cry8Ea1 toxins, i.e., with or without bound DNA, were separately obtained. Size-exclusion chromatography analysis indicated that the Cry8Ca2 toxin-DNA complex has a tight or compact structure. The Cry8 toxin-DNA complex is more likely to move toward the air/water interface and is more hydrophobic than the toxin without DNA. Competitive binding assays indicated that the Cry8Ca2 and Cry8Ea1 toxins without DNA specifically bind to the midgut of Anomala corpulenta and Holotrichia parallela larvae, respectively. In contrast, the association of DNA with each toxin might result in the nonspecific recognition of the Cry toxin and its target receptor in the insect midgut. The association of the DNA fragment with the Cry8 toxin was shown to protect the Cry protein from digestion by proteases. Based on our results, we propose an additional step in the mechanism of action of the Cry8 toxin and elucidate the function of the associated DNA as well as the importance of the removal of this DNA for the insecticidal activity of the toxin.

How does the Bt Cry41Aa toxin kill human cancer cells? Barbara Domanska, Vidisha Krishnan, Gizem Altun, Michelle West and Neil Crickmore Department of Biochemistry, School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton, BN1 9QG Address for Correspondence: bd73@sussex.ac.uk

In this study the cytocidal activity associated with the Cry41Aa human cancer cell-active toxin of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), also known as Parasporin-3, was characterized. We investigated the effects of recombinant Cry41Aa on the human hepatic cancer cell line HepG2 to elucidate its mode of action. Cry41Aa shares structural homology with commercially used insecticidal toxins. The fact that some Bt toxins are able to kill mammalian cells may threaten the use of Bt toxin-based pesticides in the future. Moreover the preferential and narrow cytocidal activity of Cry41Aa has potential for anticancer drug design. Significant uptake of fluorescent dye was observed in susceptible cells as little as 10 minutes post administration, suggesting rapid membrane damage. Microscopic observation revealed cellular and nuclear swelling induced within the first hour of treatment. The activation of apoptosis effectors Caspase 3/7 was not observed within 24 hours, although phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase was. Our results suggest that Cry41Aa, like its insecticidal homologues - but unlike some other Parasporins, is a pore-forming toxin that rapidly increases membrane permeability in the target cell. Research is on-going to identify whether a specific receptor is present on the surface of susceptible cells.

The Bacillus thuringiensis human cancer cell-active Cry41Aa toxin (Parasporin3) contains the five conserved sequence blocks found in many insecticidal toxins and is believed to possess the same three domain fold. However, Cry41Aa is predicted to have an extra loop in its domain II as well as an additional “ricin” domain at its C-terminus. Deletion of the “ricin” domain resulted in a stable protein with a toxicity to HepG2 cells not significantly different to the non-modified toxin. Several deletions of the loop region all resulted in an unstable protein that could not be further analyzed. Various bioinformatic procedures were used to identify the loops at the apex of domain II that have previously been implicated in receptor binding in the insecticidal Cry toxins. A range of mutations in the putative loop 1 were made but none affected toxicity to HepG2. In loop 3 the presence of an aromatic residue at position 509 was found to be important for toxicity. In an attempt to further dissect which regions are important for toxicity hybrids have been made between insecticidal and cancer cell-active toxins. Our data to date suggest that Cry41Aa has a mechanism of action similar to the threedomain insecticidal Cry toxins.

PS1Aa2 (Cry31Aa2) formed pores in artificial membranes. These pores had several levels of conductance; the most frequently observed in 150 mM KCl solutions were of 11, 16 and 21 pS. Microspectrofluorometric experiments with the Fura-2 probe showed that the presence of PS1Aa2 can induce changes in intracellular calcium levels, most often in the form of calcium oscillations and sometimes as sustained increases. Such responses were observed in the presence and absence of extracellular calcium, with the tumor cell lines HeLa and HepG2, and with the non-tumorous cell line HEK 293. Calcium oscillations have not been described previously for Cry toxins even though some studies have shown that calcium appears to be involved in their mode of action. Our experiments required the use of much higher concentrations of toxin than suggested from the published cytotoxicity results. Despite the presence of fragments previously identified as active, its low efficacy appears to be related to the presence of DNA in the preparations causing the protein to precipitate. Future work aimed at elucidating the origin of these calcium oscillations and their role in toxicity will be greatly facilitated by an improvement in the method of preparation of this toxin.

Caenorhabditis elegans – Bacillus thuringiensis interactions: new insights into mechanisms of host
resistance and pathogen virulence Igor Iatsenko, Iuliia Boichenko, Ralf J. Sommer Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Department for Evolutionary Biology, Tuebingen, Germany
Address for correspondence: igor.iatsenko@tuebingen.mpg.de
Genetically tractable model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been successfully used in the host-pathogen interaction studies and helped to uncover conserved virulence factors of clinically relevant pathogens. At the same time interactions of this nematode with its natural pathogens are poorly investigated. Bacteria from the genus Bacillus are among potential natural pathogens of the nematodes. Therefore, previously we isolated 768 Bacillus strains and tested them for the virulence to nematodes. Although only 3% of tested Bacillus strains were pathogenic, one strain called B. thuringiensis DB27 exhibited extreme virulence to C. elegans. Currently we are trying to tackle both sides of this hostpathogen equation and aiming to identify virulence factors of B. thuringiensis DB27 as well as C. elegans defense mechanisms. First, combining plasmid-curing and genome sequencing, we discovered that novel nematicidal Cry21 toxins with synergistic activity are the main nematicidal factors of DB27. We expressed these novel toxins in E. coli and confirmed their activity against C. elegans. Importantly, these toxins are also active against other free-living and animal parasitic nematodes, suggesting their potential application against parasitic nematodes. Our parallel work on the host side led to the discovery of C. elegans novel innate immunity pathway involved in the defense against pathogens. Specifically, we identified novel function for Dicer in C. elegans antibacterial innate immunity and showed that this function is largely associated with microRNA processing. Taken together, our reciprocal studies uncovered a previously unknown role for DCR-1/Dicer in C. elegans antibacterial immunity as well as identified novel nematicidal toxins.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs of ~22 nucleotides which play significant roles in gene regulation at transcriptional as well as post-transcriptional levels. They are produced in almost all eukaryotes and also encoded by some viruses. Besides cellular miRNAs that may participate in antiviral responses following infection, virus-encoded miRNAs may target host genes to interfere with host survival, proliferation and immunity. Furthermore, virus-encoded miRNAs may regulate replication of virus to avoid over replication and quick demise of the host or facilitate virus entry into persistent infection. The interaction may become more complicated in the presence of third parties, such as microbiota and endosymbionts, that in turn may affect the host’s miRNA profile and indirectly disturb virus replication. In the presentation, the role of miRNAs in mosquito-arbovirus interactions with a reference to the effect of Wolbachia as an endosymbiont on the interactions will be discussed.

RNA interference plays a central role in antiviral innate

immunity in flies. Indeed, flies mutant for the three key

components of the small interfering (si)RNA pathway, namely

Dicer-2, R2D2 and Argonaute (AGO) 2 are highly sensitive to

a wide range of viruses (1). Dicer-2 produces virus derived-

siRNAs from viral RNAs throughout its RNaseIII activity. The

Dicer-2/R2D2 heterodimer then loads these siRNAs onto

AGO2 in the RNA-induced silencing complex, RISC. The

RISC complex is then able to target viral RNAs, thus impairing

the ability of the virus to successfully replicate. Although in

vitro and in vivo experiments clearly indicate that Dicer-2 can

process long double stranded RNA, the exact nature of the

viral RNAs sensed in vivo in infected cells remains

mysterious. We are interested in understanding how Dicer-2

senses viral RNAs, with a particular focus on the contribution

of the N-terminal DExD/C helicase domain, which is

conserved in mammalian RIG-I like receptors. Indeed, in vitro

experiments have revealed a critical role of this domain in

both processivity of the enzyme and discrimination of the

extremities of the template RNA (1,2). To address this

question, we take advantage of a combination of approaches

including Drosophila genetics, next-generation sequencing

technologies and bioinformatics analysis.

Small RNA-directed antiviral immunity in disease-vector mosquitoes
Kevin M. Myles Virginia Tech, Fralin Life Science Institute, Department of
Entomology, Blacksburg, Virginia, USA Address for Correspondence: mylesk@vt.edu
The natural maintenance cycles of many mosquito-borne pathogens require establishment of persistent non-lethal infections in the invertebrate host. While the mechanisms by which this occurs are not well understood, antiviral responses directed by small RNAs are important in modulating the pathogenesis of viral infections in disease vector mosquitoes. Infection of Aedinine vector species with viral pathogens triggers the production of short interfering (siRNAs) and another class of virus-derived small RNAs, ping-pongdependent piwi- interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Unlike ping-pongdependent piRNAs that have been described previously, from repetitive elements or piRNA clusters, our work suggests biogenesis in the mosquito soma. Similar to siRNAs, viral piRNAs also appear capable of modulating the pathogenesis of viral infections in mosquito cells. Thus, the non-canonical piRNA pathway present in the soma of Aedinine vector species may provide robustness to the primary siRNA-based antiviral response.

The paradigm held for a long time that RNAi response in most metazoans does not undergoes an amplification step and only acted cell-autonomously has prevailed in the model system Drosophila melanogaster and it is widely accepted for higher metazoans. The absence of systemic RNAi spread in Drosophila was directly tested in one study that used dsRNAexpressing transgenes in vivo in flies. We challenged this idea by identifying a dsRNA uptake pathway in Drosophila and showing that flies defective in several of the RNAi uptake genes are hypersensitive to virus infection, indicating that RNAi uptake is essential in the process of antiviral defense. In a second area, using a cloning approach to capture small RNAs with a 5’ triphosphate group, we show that virus-derived siRNAs (vsRNA) bearing 5’ triphosphate group accumulate in Sindbis virus (SINV) infected Drosophila melanogaster, suggesting that secondary vsRNA are produce during infection. Finally, we found that Criket Paralysis virus encoding RNAi suppressor, CrPV-1A specifically interacts with Ago-2 within assembled holo-RISC, without modifying RISC composition, and that this interaction prevents RISC cleavage of target mRNAs. Interestingly, we discovered that CrPV1A recruit an E3 ligase. The implication.

Double trouble for thrips: Effective biopesticide combinations to control soil-dwelling stages in
chrysanthemums Michael Brownbridge, Taro Saito and Paul Côté Vineland Research and Innovation Centre, Vineland Station,
Ontario, Canada Address for Correspondence: michael.brownbridge@vinelandresearch.com
Western flower thrips (WFT) are pests of global significance and a constant challenge in greenhouse floriculture. Faced with a lack of conventional control products, Canadian growers have embraced the use of biological control strategies to manage this pest. Soil-dwelling stages of thrips (pro-pupae, pupae) can be targeted with different natural enemies, including biopesticides. Steinernema feltiae (e.g., Nemasys®), applied as a drench, is widely used. Metarhizium brunneum (formerly anisopliae; Met52™) has recently been registered in Canada and the granular biopesicide product is incorporated into potting media. A series of trials were set up to assess compatibility of the two control agents, and the relative efficacy of individual and combined, i.e. nematode plus Met52, treatments against WFT. Fewer S. feltiae were recovered from Met52 treated soils over time than from untreated media; this was generally accompanied by a concurrent increase in the number of free-living nematodes recovered. The rice carrier in the biopesticide may have served as a food source for the free-living nematodes, promoting population growth, which may have affected survival of S. feltiae. The individual nematode and fungus treatments had a measurable suppressive effect on thrips, but the combined nematode/fungus treatment provided superior control throughout. WFT populations were consistently lower on plants receiving the combined treatment and significantly fewer WFT (< 2 per plant) were found on the plants at the conclusion of the trial (8 weeks). Opportunities therefore exist to enhance the reliability and cost-effectiveness of thrips biocontrol strategies by taking an integrated approach to the deployment of biopesticides.

anisopliae under simulated field settings called ‘biocosms’. Experimental biocosms were created in plastic boxes where the vertical walls were fitted with sprayed plastic sheeting (blank oil or conidia in oil). A cohort of 300 fly pupae was added to each biocosm; on emergence, the adult flies moved to the vertical surfaces to harden their wings, simulating the exposure likely to occur in the fields. The biocosms were monitored daily for mortality and enumeration of egg laying and egg viability until all adult flies had died. Fungal treated biocosms resulted in 100% mortality within 10-17 days, depending on the fungal species. Treated populations also showed significant reduction in egg viability and life-time fecundity. Furthermore, >20% reduction in basic reproductive rate (B0) was observed in treated fly populations. Together these results demonstrate that application of oil formulations of entomopathogenic fungi could suppress existing fly populations and substantially reduce population growth rates in poultry houses as part of an IPM program. Further studies will focus on evaluating fungal persistence on typical structural surfaces, optimizing application parameters and validating these strategies under actual field conditions in poultry houses.

Control of the larger grain borer (Prostephanus truncatus Horn) using chemical insecticides is no longer desirable due to environmental and food safety issues. Classical biological control using the Histerid beetle, Teretrius nigrescens has been adapted in several locations in Ghana. However, P. truncatus is still causing tremendous losses of stored maize. There is a growing interest in using mycopesticides to complement other integrated pest management measures. Recent research in the UK has identified Beauveria bassiana, IMI 389521 as a suitable control agent for grain storage pests in the UK. In this study, the pathogenicity of B. bassiana IMI 389521 was evaluated against adults of P. truncatus, Sitophilus zeamais and T. nigrescens. The result obtained from the study indicates that B. bassiana, is pathogenic against adults of P. truncatus and S. zeamais. Teretrius nigrescens was less susceptible to the fungus. To determine the most effective concentration of B. bassiana for the control of P. truncatus in a semi-field trial, a laboratory dose response experiment using four concentrations of B. bassiana, (1x108 to 1011/kg maize) was studied. Successful control of P. truncatus on infested maize was achieved at 1x1010conidia per kg maize. Semi-field trial to evaluate the efficacy of B. bassiana, against P. truncatus on maize stored on cobs (dehusked) and on shelled kernels is on-going. The availability and safety of maize will be enhanced, through reduction in the use of chemical insecticides if the isolate is proved effective thereby improving the livelihood of smallholder farmers in Ghana.

Insect disease causing Beauveria bassiana produces a range of insecticidal metabolites and enzymes such as chitinases and proteases although few have been shown to be toxic simply through contact. Using supernatant from broth cultures of a single strain, B. bassiana could cause significant mortality of green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, within 24 hours of application. Three day old broth cultures were the most effective, with less insect mortality seen using 6 day old broth. However, aphicidal activity increased again for 7 day old broth. Submerged cultures grew better and produced stronger aphicidal supernatants when cultured in media with start pH above 5.5. Chitinase was produced a day earlier than protease Pr1. The enzymes, however, appeared to have little impact on aphicidal mortality given that their peak production periods do not correlate with the aphicidal activities of 3 or 6 day old cultures. Supernatants treated with EDTA and heat respectively, still killed aphids. High quantities of hydrolytic enzymes produced using insect cuticle medium showed no aphicidal activity. No beauvericin nor bassianolide, two known insecticidal metabolites, were detected in the supernatants. The identities of the key aphicidal components of the B. bassiana supernatants thus remain to be resolved. Keywords: supernatant, Beauveria bassiana, chitinase, Pr1, aphicidal, EDTA, beauvericin, bassianolide

False codling moth, Thaumatotibia leucotreta Meyrick (1912) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) is a key economic pest of citrus in South Africa causing pre- and post-harvest damage. Soil microbes, such as entomopathogenic fungi, offer an additional means of controlling this pest by targeting the soil-dwelling life stages. Three fungal isolates, two of the species Metarhizium anisopliae s.l. and one of the species Beauveria bassiana s.l. caused the highest levels of mortality of T. leucotreta fifth instar larvae in laboratory bioassays. In addition, these isolates were capable of persisting in a citrus orchard for six months, in sterile soil, whilst still remaining infective towards T. leucotreta fifth instar larvae. Since results may differ substantially under field conditions, further research was undertaken to determine whether these isolates remained effective when applied to non-sterile soil beneath the canopy of citrus trees in an orchard. A field trial consisting of one hectare treatment blocks, and a smaller caged trial were initiated to address this issue. Fungal spores were applied via spraying in an aqueous suspension at a concentration of 1x1014 spores per hectare for the field trial and at three different concentrations for the caged trial. Results of the large scale field trial, four months post application, support the

64

persistence capability of these isolates and, suggest that, although all three isolates were capable of reducing T. leucotreta infestation in comparison to the control block, B. bassiana performed best with an 81.33% reduction. It is thus suggested that future trials focus on the performance of this
isolate.

Wireworms, the soil-dwelling larvae of click beetles, cause severe damage in arable crops and vegetable production. Currently, no registered and effective insecticides are available. The development of alternative control approaches including botanicals or insect pathogenic organisms are demanded and favoured by EU legislation (Directive 2009/128/EC). Limited efficacy of already tested entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) could be improved by synergistically acting botanicals. In the present study repellency of botanicals towards the wireworm species Agriotes lineatus and potential interactions of the most effective repellent with a wireworm-infecting fungus strain (Metarhizium brunneum) was investigated. Behaviour and mortality of wireworms were assessed in two-dimensional terraria (40cm x 50cm x 0.6cm) with a peat-sand substrate in a choice test for up to three weeks. Wireworm location was recorded and locomotion trails were manually traced, photographed and trail length determined on the treated and untreated half of the terrarium. We found that the garlic extract R3 repelled wireworms at rates of 1.2 g/L substrate, while this concentration hardly reduced efficacy of the EPF strain. Thyme oil was comparably repellent, but also strongly antifungal. The EPF strain was not repellent. Potential synergies between EPF and efficacy enhancing botanicals will be discussed for a biological control strategy.

The fungus Beauveria brongniartii (Sacc.) Petch has been used to control the European cockchafer Melolontha melolontha L. for more than two decades. The goal of this study was to assess persistence of the applied B. brongniartii strain in the soil of 20 cockchafer infested sites in East, North and South Tyrol. The sites have been treated with

Melocont® Pilzgerste (BIPESCO 2) at different frequencies and time points during the last 20 years. At all sites the denistiy of M. melolontha larvae decreased from high levels at the start of treatments to levels below the damage threshold at the time point of sampling in 2012. A selective medium was used to determine B. brongniartii density and recover B. brongniartii isolates from soil samples. Collected isolates were subjected to genetic analyses to discriminate the applied strain from naturally occuring strains. Highest densities of Beauveria spp. (up to 6.8 x 105 CFU g-1 soil dry weight) were detected in soils which have been treated with Melocont® Pilzgerste at least three times during the last three years (3 sites) prior to the sampling date. BIPESCO 2 was detected in 7 sites of which one was treated for the last time15 years prior to sampling. Beauveria spp. density varied strongly among and within fields and in 71% of the 162 soil samples no Beauveria was detected. Results suggest that periodic applications of the B. brongniartii biological control agent increase density and persistence of the fungus in soil and support a long-term control of M. melolontha.

The pathogen PaV1 (Panulirus argus Virus 1) exacts a heavy toll from juvenile Caribbean spiny lobsters with an estimated 24% in Florida dying of it before they reach maturity and recruit to the fishery. Prevalence is also high among adult populations, especially in the northern Caribbean (e.g., Puerto Rico – 17%). However, PaV1 manifests differently in adults. They may act as “carriers” because adults rarely develop visible infections and do not seem adversely affected by the pathogen. Infected adults are not avoided by healthy conspecifics, as occurs among juveniles. Moreover, adult females with subclinical PaV1 infections are often captured from the wild with a spermatophore or fertilized eggs, indicating that males are willing to mate with them. Adults with subclinical infections of PaV1 are not infectious to other adults or to the more susceptible juveniles. Although postlarval lobsters infected with PaV1 occur in the nearshore waters of Florida, experiments indicate that vertical transmission of PaV1 from females to embryos is not the mode of transmission. Instead, postlarvae acquire PaV1 shortly after arriving inshore from the oceanic plankton. These recent results suggest that PaV1 may be of little consequence to adult lobsters in contrast to its major effect on juvenile ecology and population dynamics. Just how adult lobsters retain subclinical infections of PaV1 remains a mystery.

The American lobster (Homarus americanus) fishery is the economic engine for hundreds of coastal communities in Atlantic Canada and represents the last remaining significant wild fishery in Canada. Lobsters appear remarkably resistant to microbes in their natural environment however they are susceptible to the opportunistic ciliated pathogen Anophryoides haemophila, the causative agent of bumper car disease, during live holding. We have completed numerous controlled experimental infection studies to define the gross, histopathology, biochemical and molecular responses of lobster to this ciliated parasite. Recently completed high throughput oligonucleotide microarray and RNA-Seq transcriptomics studies have revealed a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of disease in this unique lobster – parasite interaction. One caveat is interpreting the overwhelming wealth of bioinformatic data generated. This issue will be explored in the context of current annotation limitations for both arthropods and protistan parasites.

Bitter crab disease (BCD) is a fatal disease of crustaceans caused by parasitic dinoflagellates of the genus Hematodinium. This emerging disease has been reported in over forty species of crustaceans world-wide including several commercially important crustacean species. In Atlantic Canada BCD occurs in snow crabs (Chionoecetes opilio) off the northern coasts of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. In the late stages of this disease, the dinoflagellate parasites proliferate within the hemolymph and hemal spaces within the crustacean’s organs, with no apparent cellular inflammatory response to the infection. The cause of death in cases of BCD is presumed to be metabolic and osmotic dysregulation. In this study, we use a combination of untargeted and targeted metabolomic approaches to characterize some of the metabolic changes associated with BCD.

UK populations of the shore crab Carcinus maenas host various pathogen assemblages. In particular, two geographically close but distinct populations in Weymouth, (Newton’s Cove and Harbour), demonstrated entirely different pathogen profiles. Immune biomarkers were used to assess the immunocompetence of individuals in these populations in relation to their pathogen burden. Selected immune genes included carcinin, (antimicrobial peptide), peroxinectin (cell adhesion molecule and osponin) and the zymogen prophenoloxidase, (cleaved to form active phenoloxidase, involved in the melanisation of many invading pathogens). Immune gene expression was quantified using real-time PCR. Histopathology revealed greater pathogen incidence in Newton’s Cove (95%) compared with Harbour (37%) and a high dissimilarity in the pathogen profile (82.61% SIMPER) between sites. Host immune expression in relation to the presence and absence of pathogens and number of different infections per crab, revealed significant (p=<0.01) differences in transcription between populations, suggesting site-specific factors also influenced immune expression. In addition, host RNA quality was compared between pathogen groups (‘viruses’, ‘bacteria’, ‘macroparasites’ and ‘no pathogens’ groups). Further analysis may reveal whether RNA degradation is a function of pathogen type within the host. This is the first study to compare immunocompetence and histopathology between different Carcinus maenas populations in the wild.

Parasitic dinoflagellates of the genus, Hematodinium, are thought to be significant pathogens of a wide range of crustaceans. Much is known of the ecology and effects of this disease on the sustainability of crustacean populations but significantly less is known about the mode of transmission and fate of infected animals. Attempts have been made to transmit the disease under aquarium conditions to several species of crabs resulting in a great deal of variation in mortality levels and the timescale of disease progression. To determine if Hematodinium infections are significant drivers of mortality in juvenile edible crabs (Cancer pagurus), crabs were injected with either 1 x 105 Hematodinium trophonts from an infected animal or sterile saline. Crabs were bled every four weeks to determine the progression of infection and its effects on the numbers of circulating haemocytes. Thirty three percent of the Hematodinium-injected crabs became infected and mortality occurred between 93 and 378 days post-challenge. Infected crabs appeared to moult less frequently than their uninfected counterparts but mortality did not appear to be directly caused by Hematodinium, as there was no significant difference in the mean time to death between infected and uninfected crabs. Both Hematodiunium-infected and uninfected crabs exhibited infections by a number of other disease causing agents including haplosporidium-like parasites, fungi and bacteria. These appeared to be key drivers of the mortality observed. These studies, albeit carried out on small cohorts of edible crabs, imply that Hematodinium is not a driver of host mortality at least under aquarium conditions.

White spot disease (WSD) is caused by white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) (Nimaviridae). WSSV emerged in the early-tomid 1990s in Southeast Asia and became panzoonotic since. The disease can be mitigated by introducing rigorous sanitation protocols, proper pond management, use of specific pathogen-free shrimp and by early diagnosis followed by eradication. The virus is transmitted horizontally by healthy individuals predating on diseased ones, via feeding on detritus or by intake of WSSV-contaminated water. WSSV can also be transmitted vertically via broodstock. The virus infects a wide range of crustaceans beyond the penaeids such as crabs and crayfish, and these co-inhabitants of ponds form a reservoir of WSSV for disease transmission to penaeids. Much less knowledge is there on the potential of resident benthic organisms as vectors for WSSV. A literature survey indicates that WSSV is present in a number of non-crustacean invertebrates, which sometimes vector the disease to penaeid shrimp. Dendronereis spp. is a most ubiquitous resident annelid in shrimp ponds and used as food source for shrimp. We showed that WSSV replicates in Dendronereis spp. and can be transmitted from this polychaete to penaeid shrimp. Furthermore there appears to be a positive correlation between the past incidence of WSD in ponds and the occurrence of WSSV in resident Dendronereis spp, whereas there is no correlation with other pond parameters. We hypothesize that Dendronereis spp., as a replicative host for WSSV, may serve as a reservoir for WSSV and may be associated with the persistence of this virus in pond systems.

Novel Pattern Recognition Receptor Protects Shrimp from Vibrio Infection by Binding Flagellin and LPS through Different Recognition Modules Xian-Wei Wang; Jin-Xing Wang
School of Life Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan, China Address for Correspondence: jxwang@sdu.edu.cn
Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize pathogens thorough the pattern recognition modules. For example, Toll like receptors recognize the ligands through leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), and C-type lectins bind to glycans on the surface of pathogens by the C-type carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD, also called C-type lectin like domain CTLD). Many PRRs contain more than one kind of modules. In the present study, we identified a novel PRR, named Leulectin, which contains several LRRs and a CTLD. Such unique arrangement has not been found in any other organisms. Recombinant Leulectin and the modules (LRRs and CTLD) were found to protect shrimp from Vibrio infection. An ELISAbased screen was performed to identify the potential ligands the two modules may recognize. Results showed that LRRs could recognize the Vibrio flagellins, and CTLD could recognize lipopolysacchraides (LPS). The Leulectin-flagellin interaction was determined by the third LRR of Leulectin and

the N-terminus of flagellin, and the Leulectin-LPS interaction was dependent on the long loop region of CTLD in a calciumindependent manner. The ligand-recognizing activity of LRRs and CTLD was critical for Leulectin to bind to bacteria, and the binding was the basis for Leulectin to protect shrimp from bacterial infection. This study clearly showed the interesting synergy between distinct modules of a PRR.

In June 2012 a few shrimp from Plaquemines parish LA with the symptoms of microsporidiosis were delivered to the Louisiana Aquatic Diagnostic Laboratory for identification. Light microscopy including examination of Luna-stained paraffin sections, and electron microscopy showed the infection was limited to ovaries and was caused by a microsporidium producing roundish pansporoblasts with 8 spores (3.6 x 2.1µm) and anisofilar (2+6) polar filaments, the features corresponding to the diagnosis of Agmasoma penaei (=Thelohania penaei Sprague 1950, n.comb Hazrad and Oldacre, 1973). Comparison of the SSUrDNA sequence of the novel isolate to A.penaei from Thailand revealed 95% similarity, which suggests these geographical isolates, may be two different species, a conclusion supported by several ultrastructural dissimilarities and different tissue tropism. Phylogenetic analyses places this species as a divergent taxa within the clade IV (microsporidia of terrestrial origin) sensu Vosbrinck, Debruner-Vossbrinck, 2005. In two shrimps infection of ovaries with A. penaei was accompanied by heavy infestation of muscles with another microsporidium Perezia nelsoni. P.nelsoni produces individual spores (2.0 x 1.1µm). Structurally and genetically (SSUrDNA sequence similarity >99%) LA isolate was identical to Perezia nelsoni from the Mississipi coast of the Gulf (Canning et al., 2002). Previously reported infection of muscles with A.penaei may be due to overlooked double infection with P.nelsoni. Supported by Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.

It is expected that particular adaptive ecological traits influence species abundance and distribution within an ecosystem. We evaluated selected traits of different co-existing species and genotypes of the entomopathogenic fungi Metarhizium isolated from an agroecosystem in Denmark. Fifteen fungal isolates representing 11 genotypes were tested for: UVB tolerance, in vitro growth at 12.5°C and 21.5°C, mycelial growth from the insect cadaver into the surrounding soil, virulence and conidia production on cadavers. The results showed that the relative performance of the most abundant Metarhizium genotype was intermediate for mycelial growth in soil and in vitro growth at 12.5°C / 21.5°C while it showed high UVB tolerance and conidia production compared to other genotypes. We discuss whether the two latter traits are most important to dominate the Metarhizium community in agricultural habitat or whether the “Jack of all trades” performance could be the key to understand the dominance of a particular genotype.

Efficacy of Metarhizium and Beauveria entomopathogenic fungal strains for the control of cockchafer grubs was evaluated in sour cherry orchards. Safety like possible effect of the inoculum on natural soil microbiota as well as efficacy and fate of these fungi need to be investigated. The applied fungal strains have wide host range, thus we have to determine the risks of their use during repeated long-term applications. Different inoculation methods were compared and the persistence of inoculum was monitored in the soil and on target and non-target organisms. The treatments were applied 2 times (May and July) in the space rows and we used pitfall traps as sampling method. Samples were collected 8 times during the summer of 2013. The samples were processed in laboratory and the numbers of different arthropods (collembolans, mites, thrips, flies, ants, spiders, centipedes, crickets, rove beetles, ground beetles) were recorded in each sample. The comparison of un-treated and treated areas, and the microscopical examination showed no significant differences in the frequency of species. As a conclusion, the effect of these entomopathogens on non-target arthropods is minimal and as such they do not impose any environmental risk.

against insect pests. In the present study, the antagonistic activity of B. bassiana (strain ATCC 74040) after plant inoculation and endophytic establishment in grapevine against the vine mealybug Planococcus ficus was assessed using surface sterilized leaves for a bioassay. Possible effects of endophytic B. bassiana on the feeding preference of black vine weevil Otiorhynchus sulcatus choosing between control and inoculated plants was examined through choice assays. A significant effect of endophytic B. bassiana on growth during the whole observation period and on mortality of mealybugs one week after initial settlement was evident. Adult O. sulcatus chose significantly more often the control plants as a host plant compared to grapevine plants with endophytic B. bassiana. In addition, a microarray analysis was performed to get insights into genetic mechanisms behind the plant-fungus-interaction. The results indicate an up-regulation of diverse defense related genes in grapevine due to the endophytic establishment of B. bassiana. In conclusion, endophytic establishment of the entomopathogenic fungus B. bassiana in grapevine might represent an alternative and sustainable plant protection strategy, with the potential for reducing pesticide applications in viticulture.

Horizontal transmission of entomopathogens by parasitoids is well known for viruses but did not registered for fungi. Our experiments were carried out on the laboratory system Galleria mellonella (Lepidoptera, Piraliidae), – Habrobracon hebetor (Hymenopera, Braconidae) – Beauveria bassiana (Hypocreales, Cordycipitaceae). We found out that contamination of H. hebetor ovipositor with low titers of conidia B. bassiana and following envenomation of G. mellonella larvae led to mycoses followed by host colonization and conidiaformation. In addition H. hebetor females transmitted fungal conidia from infected (6 hours post inoculation with conidia) to native G. mellonella larvae, and this transmission led to successful mycosis of native host larvae. The decreasing of cellular and humoral immune reactions, significant increasing of adhesion and germination of fungus on cuticle of envenomated larvae were registered. As a result susceptibility of envenomated G. mellonella larvae to fungal infection was increased in thousands times compared with native control. Thus the paralyzation and strong inhibition of immune reactions of larvae by venom of H. hebetor allows to minimize quantity of transmitting with parasitoid fungal inoculum. We assumed that «paralyzing» parasitoids can take part in transmission of entomopathogenic fungi particularly in out-of-the-way places (shelters) as well as disperse of fungal infection under low density of hosts.

Fungal entomopathogens are important antagonists of arthropod pests and have attracted increased attention as biocontrol agents in integrated pest management programs. In addition, evidence has accumulated that some entomopathogenic fungi like Beauveria bassiana (Bals.) Vuill. can endophytically colonize plants and provide a systemic protection against insect pests. Currently, it is unknown whether B. bassiana can exist as an endophyte in grapevine, Vitis vinifera (L.) and still maintains its antagonistic potential

Many ant species are highly successful invaders and can dominate vast areas by forming dense networks of connected nests in contrast to the smaller and discrete, spatially dispersed colonies of most social insects. However, it was recently proposed that such supercolonies are more vulnerable to infection by parasites and diseases as they would serve as large targets with high rates of transmission from nest to nest. Here we studied the invasive garden ant Lasius neglectus, a new pest species which is currently spreading throughout Europe where several populations are infected with the ectoparasitic fungus Laboulbenia formicarum. In one population (supercolony) we followed the prevalence and intensity of the infection over 10 years, revealing an epizootic spread of the ectoparasite with the mean annual prevalence increasing from 0.126 to 0.997. Distinct body parts of the ants had markedly different infection intensities, and at low intensities antennae and thorax were free from signs of infection. There were no seasonal differences in infection intensity and no other Lasius species in the area was found to be infected. These results give the first direct support to the hypothesis that supercolonies of invasive ants potentially face a significantly higher threat from parasites and diseases compared to ants with normal colonies, implying interesting perspectives for biological control of these pest species.

In the course of a floristic and ecological study of the entomopathogenic fungi found in apple orchards and strawberry fields (part of the IMBICONT biological control project), we observed resting spores in the frass of the earwig Forficula auricularia, a beneficial predator in apple orchards. The presence of resting spores in earwig frass suggests that in addition to being a beneficial predator, earwigs may play a role in the dispersal of Entomophthoromycota—a spore dispersal mechanism not previously documented for this group of fungi. In the lab, we observed that earwigs avidly consumed entomophthoromycotan-infected insects even while the fungus was actively ejecting conidia. We hypothesize that this fungusinsect meal might confer a nutritional benefit but that earwigs avoid foraging on insects infected by generalist entomopathogenic fungi (e.g. Metarhizium, Beauveria) because these generalist entomopathogens pose a risk that would potentially outweigh any nutritional benefit. We present the preliminary results from a series of choice-experiments to test these hypotheses.

The effects of a selected group of six entomopathogenic fungal isolates (including the mycoinsecticide Naturalis and the Beauveria bassiana ATCC74040 strain contained into the commercial product) on the system “T.vaporariorum E.formosa” were evaluated, considering the direct effect on the parasitoid development but also on the E. formosa activity and behaviour. The effect of fungal treatments on the parasitoid development was evaluated submitting infested tomato plants to the fungal treatments at different times from the parasitization and recording the parasitization rate and the parasitoids emergence. Then, the effect of fungal isolates on E. formosa behaviour and activity was examinated in “freemultichoice” and “no-choice condition”. Finally, the role of E. formosa in trasmitting the mycoses from infected to uninfected host population was estimated. Results showed that fungal treatments can affect the E. formosa development, particularly when applied before the parasitoids introduction and using the mycoinsecticide Naturalis. E. formosa showed no differential tropism in “free - multichoice” conditions and it was not able to locate and select the uninfected hosts “at distance” but it was able to detect and avoid infected hosts by direct exploration. Furtheremore, E. formosa was able in vectoring the fungal propagules from contaminated to uncontaminated hosts trough its activity. Results of these laboratory experiments provided important information about the possibility to integrate the entomopathogenic fungal treatments and the Encarsia formosa releases and clarified some biological and behavioural aspects of the “host–pathogen–parasitoid” system.

The use of microbial biopesticides and other minimal-risk products is starting to become more widespread as a result of new government legislation that aims to reduce the excessive use of conventional chemical pesticides and increase the use of “alternative” control methods. In the European Union, a paradigm shift in pesticide policy has occurred recently with the enactment of the Sustainable Use Directive on pesticides. This legislation makes IPM mandatory for farmers and growers and gives specific emphasis to biologically based controls including microbial biopesticides. There has been significant recent activity in the biopesticides industrial sector, with multinational agchem / agri-business companies buying up biopesticide

companies. The large financial resources of the global companies should lead to an increase in the effectiveness, sales and availability of microbial biopesticide products, but SMEs will still have a critical role to play through the development of innovative, “next generation” biopesticides. All of these products will need to have authorization for use by government regulatory organisation. Authorization can be slow and expensive, which can be a barrier to product development. The authorities recognize this and have put in place measures designed to improve the system, sometimes with mixed results. We have explored why product authorization is necessary, and in this presentation we will discuss ways in which biopesticide regulation could be improved further.

the long path from discovering a promising isolate to making it a tool for growers. This may also help improve the dialogue between industry and academia to identify points along this path where collaborations can contribute towards that common goal.

Registration of Biopesticides in the EU: a company perspective Philip Kessler,
Andermatt Biocontrol AG, Grossdietwil, Switzerland Address for Correspondance: kessler@biocontrol.ch
One characteristic of many biopesticides is their narrow host range. This represents a lot of advantages, e.g. protecting the beneficial fauna, harmlessness towards human health etc., but it significantly reduces the potential market size for such products. The procedures for the registration of a biopesticide are mostly the same as for a chemical plant protection product, even if the characteristics of the active substance and the exigencies for the risk assessment differ in many aspects. The difficulties with registering biopesticides are often unknown or inappropriate data requirements, lack of experience within authorities to assess biopesticides, often resulting in unreasonable delays of the evaluation procedures, and too high registration fees. Under such conditions it is almost impossible for the industry to make the development of biopesticides with small-sized markets costeffective. Furthermore they jeopardize investments in research for new biopesticides. Although the new EU regulation 1107/2009 provides new criteria for the approval of plant protection products - stricter evaluation timelines, a low risk category and evaluation within distinct zones- the uncertainties and high costs for the registration of biopesticides still exist. As a consequence, the industry will focus its investments in research and development of new biopesticides outside of the EU, where the registration of biopesticides is easier. It will become more difficult for European growers to have access to new, innovative and environmental friendly biopesticides in the future, especially in niche markets.

Invertebrate pathology is an applied field, and a major aim of research is to make the technologies discovered available to growers through the development and registration of new biopesticide products. The biopesticide market is growing at over 15% per annum: the global market was valued at $1.3 billion in 2011 and is predicted to reach $3.2 billion by 2017. There is a challenge therefore to meet the forecast demand for biopesticide products. Most of the micro-organism based products currently on the market are the ‚back catalogue‘, representing research and technology that has been on the laboratory bench for the last 20 or 30 years. To bring plant protection products to the market they have to be registered, how this happens varies country to country and can take many years. In a biopesticide commercialisation pathway, registration is a significant barrier, demanding considerable investment in time and financial resources. Biopesticide research projects need to be designed and structured so research and industry can work in alignment and so reduce the hurdle of registration. This presentation will explore approaches that have been implemented in biopesticide projects to better align research and industry objectives and build partnerships to facilitate the regulatory process thus reducing commercialisation costs and reducing product development timelines.

When developing a new bioinsecticide active and associated formulations there are a series of stage gates that must be met by R&D to ensure final product registration in North America. At each gate confidence is gained to justify further resourcing. This presentation will discuss in general terms the critical milestones and strategy for prioritizing those milestones for a bioinsecticide. Specific reference will be made to Met52 and R&D’s role in generating knowledge for its current registration and label expansion. By presenting this perspective, it may shed light on

Microorganisms as active ingredients in plant protection products are gaining more and more importance. This is due to the fact that most of them have little effect (if any at all) on human health, non-target organisms, and the environment. However, registration of Microbial Plant Protection Products is still facing particular problems, which is partly due to the fact that some data requirements which can be easily covered for synthetic chemicals cannot be fulfilled for microorganisms and their products for technical reasons. On the other hand, the major advantage of most microbial products is that the microorganism species are scientifically well known and humans are familiar with them either through direct use or environmental exposure for a long time. Data requirements are similar in different regulatory systems, but acceptance of publicly available data for the risk assessment by authorities varies over time and between different regulatory systems.

Two alleles of the cqm1 gene, containing mutations associated to resistance to the Binary (Bin) from Lysinibacillus sphaericus, were co-selected in a laboratory resistant colony of Culex quinquefasciatus (R2362). The goal of this study was to identify these alleles and to analyze the homozygous larvae for each one, through different approaches. The alleles named cqm1REC and cqm1REC-2 are characterized by distinct mutations, however, they code for transcripts of truncated proteins that are not located in the midgut epithelium and cannot act as receptors for the Bin toxin. Homozygous larvae for each allele show high resistance to the Bin toxin, low specific binding of Bin toxin to midgut microvilli proteins and low transcription level of the both resistance alleles. Their frequency in the R2362 colony showed that the cqm1REC has predominated during a long period (> 100 generations), however, it has been replaced by the cqm1REC-2 that became the most frequent allele. A colony established from the cross of homozygous individuals from each allele (1:1 ratio) showed that cqm1REC assumed a higher frequency, compared to cqm1REC-2, during a period of 21 generations. An AS-PCR-screening detected the presence of cqm1REC-2 allele in larvae from field populations and its frequency and distribution was lower than that found for cqm1REC, suggesting that this allele has a higher risk to be selected. The fitness cost of individuals homozygous is under study to evaluate the impact on the biological performance of individuals carrying these alleles.

fungal diseases and promote plant growth. Remarkably, two strains, Pseudomonas protegens CHA0 and Pseudomonas chlororaphis PCL1391, additionally display oral insecticidal activity towards lepidopteran larvae. This ability is associated with the Fit insect toxin and unknown GacA-regulated traits. However, the exact course of infection, the target organs and the virulence factors beyond Fit are yet undiscovered. To tackle these open questions we combined various methods. Fifteen strains of fluorescent pseudomonads, including four new isolates, were characterized for both their plant-beneficial traits and their insecticidal activity. Whereas the former were found throughout the entire P. fluorescens group, the latter was restricted to strains of P. protegens and P. chlororaphis. By next generation sequencing and subsequent comparative genomics we identified a small set of genes common to all insecticidal strains, but absent in non-insecticidal strains. These genes could therefore encode potential virulence factors against insects. Histopathology to detect affected insect tissues and fluorescence microscopy to localize the bacteria during the infection complete this study which reveals intriguing aspects on insect pathogenesis of plant-associated pseudomonads and identifies several strains with potent dual activity against root pathogens and insect pests.

The Cqm1 and Aam1 are ortholog proteins from the midgut of Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti larvae, respectively. These related proteins, with 74% of identity, are expressed as membrane-bound alpha-glucosidases and, functionally, Cqm1 also acts as the receptor of the insecticidal Binary (Bin) toxin from Lysinibacillus sphaericus, while Aam1 does not. The major goal of this study was to analyze some features of these proteins produced in Sf9 cells. The recombinant proteins obtained in this expression system showed the same molecular weight and kept their differential capacity to bind to the Bin toxin, as the native proteins. The Cqm1 sequence presents three predicted N-glycosylation sites (PGS), however, the analysis of the recombinant protein suggested that it does not have glycans. On the other hand, Aam1 sequence has six PGS and analysis of the recombinant protein showed that four of them contain carbohydrates that can be removed by the glycosidase PNGase F. Site-directed mutagenesis of these PGS prevented the insertion of carbohydrates and these mutant proteins did not bind to the Bin toxin, similarly to the wild Aam1. In terms of their catalytic function, both recombinant proteins displayed alpha-glucosidase activity and Aam1 showed a two-fold increase compared to Cqm1. Analysis of protein sequences showed that one segment of the Cqm1, that is required for Bin toxin binding, is not conserved in the Aam1 and might be an important factor for their differential capacity to interact with the Bin toxin and, thus, for the refractoriness of Ae. aegypti larvae to L. sphaericus.

Resilience of the intestinal epithelium to the action of a bacterial pore-forming toxin and to xenobiotics in Drosophila Kwang-Zin Lee, Matthieu Lestradet, Stephanie Limmer, Samuel Liégeois, and Dominique Ferrandon

The host defense against pathogens encompasses two complementary arms: i) resistance, attacking directly the pathogen, which is mediated by the immune system; ii) resilience, also referred to as tolerance, withstanding and repairing damages inflicted either by the pathogen or by the host's own immune system. We have discovered that the compensatory proliferation of Drosophila intestinal stem cells (ISCs) allows the intestinal epithelium to maintain its homeostasis during Serratia marcescens infection, and thus constitutes a bona fide resilience mechanism. Resilience is not limited to the control of ISC proliferation. Within three hours of ingestion of S. marcescens, the epithelium becomes very thin in the absence of cell death. Strikingly, epithelial cells are able to recover their shape and volume in the next 6-9 hours. Attack by S. marcescens hemolysin, a 2 nm-wide pore-forming toxin, leads to the controlled extrusion of the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. This may help in purging the cytoplasm from damaged organelles. We have initiated a molecular analysis using both a genetic and a transcriptomics approach and thus identified tens of genes required for the regeneration phase. One of them, a conserved cyclin of previously unknown function, plays a major role noncell-autonomously and is required for the expression of early response genes. Many of these genes are also induced by exposure to xenobiotics such as caffeine. We have found that the cyclin mutants are more susceptible to the ingestion of caffeine. Thus, we may have uncovered a novel stress response pathway that underlies a new resilience mechanism.

Insecticidal crystal toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) of the Cry1A family bind to a 12-cadherin domain protein in the midgut of lepidoptera and eventually form pores in the midgut epithelium, leading to death of the insect. Mutations in this cadherin confer Cry1A resistance to several Lepidoptera. In the course of an F1 screen to estimate the frequency of such mutations in field populations of the tobacco budworm Heliothis virescens, a novel mutation was found. Like the first mutation found in this species, it is caused by insertion of a transposable element, but in a different location. Allele frequency changes were recorded over several generations of artificial selection for a homozygous mutant strain, showing a substantial fitness cost to knockout cadherin mutations, even under optimal conditions in the laboratory. Although this type of transposoninduced mutation may be moderately common in field populations, its high fitness cost makes it unlikely to threaten the sustainability of transgenic cottin expressing Cry1A toxins.

Development of resistance in target insects is a major threat to long-term use of transgenic Bt crops. To delay the evolution of resistance in target insect through the implementation of the effective strategies, it is fundamental to understand the pests’ resistance mechanisms. One of the most important mechanisms of insect resistance to Bt crops is the alteration of interaction between Bt toxin and its receptor in the insect midguts. Asian corn borer (ACB), Ostrinia furnacalis, is a key pest of maize to be targeted by Bt maize. A Cry1Ac resistant strain of ACB has been established in the laboratory. Compared to the membrane proximal extracellular region (MPR) of cDNA of ofcad that encodes a cadherin-like protein in ACB from the susceptible strain, there were three mutant alleles of ofcad (MPR-r1, MPR-r2, and MPR-r3) associated with resistance to Cry1Ac toxin. Each of those mutant alleles had 2-3 aa substitution in the putative-toxin binding region (TBR) of the cadherin, especially Thr111→Ser111 was accurate. In addition, MPR-r2 had a deletion expected to eliminate 26 aaresidues in TBR, which resulted in decline in the binding of MPR to Cry1Ac in the resistant strain compared to the susceptible strain. Furthermore, down regulation of ofcad was associated with Cry1Ac resistance, response to the stress of low level Cry1Ac toxin in susceptible strain. These results suggest that Cry1Ac resistance in ACB is primarily associated with the down regulation of ofcad. Mutations in ofcad resulting in amino-acid substitutions and deletions might mediate higher level of resistance.

Insect resistance to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is one of the main threats for the long term use of Bt-based products, including Bt crops. Identification of genes conferring resistance to Bt will contribute to delaying the development of resistance as well as to provide additional information about the mode of action of these bacteria and its insecticidal toxins. By using linkage analysis based on high throughput sequencing, we have found a novel type of mutation in the ABCC2 transporter conferring resistance to Bt. In addition we have also found that different members of the ABCC transporters can act as receptors for not only Cry1A toxins but also for the Cry1C type toxins. The identified mutation in the ABCC2 transporter is

72

localized in a region that does not physically interact with the toxins but in the intracellular ATP-binding domain instead. Our toxin binding studies have revealed that such mutation correlates with a reduction in toxin insertion into the membrane (irreversible binding) and suggests that ABCC activity as transporter is necessary for the proper action of Bt toxins.

Spanish colleagues recently showed that N. ceranae has a better adaptation to complete its endogenous cycle at warmer temperatures. However, the results based on in vivo-infections only give a minor hint on different proliferation of both obligate intracellular pathogens exposed to different temperatures.

The apparent recent invasion of Nosema ceranae and its dominance over Nosema apis in honey bee populations in the USA and elsewhere have presented both an enigma and a treatment problem for apiculturists and scientists. Several studies, including those of our research group, have shown that N. ceranae produces more mature spores than N. apis, and we demonstrated that reproduction of N. ceranae recovers more quickly from fumagillin treatment than does N. apis. In addition, N. ceranae hyperproliferated in the presence of very low fumagillin concentrations in laboratory bioassays. Proteomiclevel studies of fumagillin-N. ceranae-honey bee interactions continue and we are investigating the mechanisms of protein regulation in response to infection and fumagillin treatment. In studies of infectivity, we found that N. ceranae consistently has a higher IC50 than N. apis. The effect is most pronounced at 1 day post eclosion. We investigated the interaction of N. ceranae and N. apis in individual bees and found that N. apis produced more spores than N. ceranae in 62% of bees infected with equal dosages of both Nosema species. Mixed species infections negatively affected survival time (15-17 days) compared to single species infections (20 and 21 days for N. ceranae and N. apis, respectively) and uninfected bees (27 days). Midgut spore counts were higher for mixed species infections than for single species infections, but we did not find evidence that N. ceranae outcompetes N. apis in an individual host..

Wild pollinators such as bumblebees are in global decline. They share a pathogen network with other pollinators, consisting of multi-hosts pathogens and multi-pathogens hosts. Disturbance of these associations could lead toward the further host decline. Insects have developed certain immune pathways to combat viruses, of which the small interfering RNA pathway (siRNA) is important. By unveiling the interaction of the virus with the host defense pathway we can better understand the virulence of certain viruses in specific hosts. Here we use two viruses, israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) and slow bee paralysis virus (SBPV), representing two infection types after injection in Bombus terrestris, i.e. IAPV presents an overt acute infection resulting in mortality, while SBPV results in a covert persistent infection. First, to determine viral replication dynamics by following the negative and positive strands, we developed a new method in combining multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and qPCR. The results show both viruses experienced an exponential-plateau phase, and their replication strand were relatively low compared with genome (positive) stand. Second, both viruses increased the expression of Dicer-2 and SID, thereby activating siRNA. Finally we performed small RNAs sequencing to screen if differences in the siRNA production could explain different viral virulence.

Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae are two fungal pathogens infecting the European honey bee, Apis mellifera. These obligate intracellular pathogens, belonging to the phylum Microsporidia, infect epithelia cells of the midgut and elicit nosemosis. Recent studies suggested that N. ceranae is more virulent than N. apis and can lead to severe colony losses. These colony losses are so far only reported from the Southern parts of Europe. In the Northern parts (e.g., Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and Germany) N. ceranae could not be correlated to colony losses so far. While N. ceranae seems to have replaced N. apis in the bee population in South Europe, this is not the case for the Northern parts of Europe. Both findings suggest a climatic angle for spread, assertiveness, and virulence of N.

Terrestrial isopods are crustaceans that represent a major component of the litter ecosystem, as they mainly feed on dead plant material and participate in litter decomposition. In the isopod Armadillidium vulgare, genetic sex determination follows female heterogamety (ZZ males and ZW females). However, many A. vulgare populations harbor maternally-inherited Wolbachia bacterial endosymbionts. These bacteria are reproductive parasites that convert genetic males into phenotypic females, leading to populations with female-biased sex ratios. The W sex chromosome has been lost in lines infected by Wolbachia and all individuals are ZZ genetic males. The female sex is determined by the inheritance of Wolbachia by the A. vulgare individual. Surprisingly, some A. vulgare lines exhibit

73

female-biased sex ratios despite the lack of Wolbachia. In these lines, female individuals are ZZ genetic males carrying an unknown feminizing factor. To elucidate the genetic basis of female sex determination in these lines, we sequenced the genome of a female by Illumina technology. After de novo genome assembly, we identified a large piece of the Wolbachia genome transferred into the A. vulgare nuclear genome. The transferred genomic fragment co-segregates perfectly with the female sex in pedigrees. These results suggest that sex determination in these A. vulgare lines is under the control of nuclear gene(s) of bacterial origin and that bacterial reproductive parasites can drive shifts in sex determination mechanisms in animals. This research is funded by an ERC Starting Grant

A recombinant of SecPLA2 exhibited a specific enzyme activity influenced by p H, temperature, and calcium. Especially, Se-cPLA2 was susceptible to a specific cPLA2 inhibitor, but not to a specific iPLA2 inhibitor. These results indicate that Se-cPLA2 is a specific cPLA2 and associated with immune responses.

Aerolysins are virulence factors belonging to the beta poreforming toxin (b-PFT) superfamily that are abundantly distributed in bacteria. More rarely, b-PFTs have been described in eukaryotic organisms. Recently in our laboratory, a putative cytolytic protein called Biomphalysin have been characterized in the snail, Biomphalaria glabrata, who’s primary structural features suggest that it could belong to this b-PFT superfamily. We have showed that, despite weak sequence similarities with aerolysins, Biomphalysin shares a common architecture with proteins belonging to this superfamily. A phylogenetic approach revealed that the gene encoding Biomphalysin could have resulted from horizontal transfer. Its expression seems to be restricted to immune-competent cells and is not induced by parasite challenge. Recombinant Biomphalysin showed hemolytic activity that was greatly enhanced by the plasma compartment of B. glabrata. We further demonstrated that Biomphalysin is able to bind to parasite and has a plasma dependent anti schistosomal activity. Surprisingly, investigation of B. glabrata genome reveals that this family appears to be multi-genic. More than 20 genes were identified suggesting an important role played by Biomphalysin proteins for B. glabrata. These results provide the first functional description of a mollusk immune effector protein involved in killing of S. mansoni, agent of the second most widespread tropical parasitic disease after
malaria.

Similar to other zoopathogenic fungi, many insect pathogenic hyphomycetes including species within the genera Metarhizium, Beauveria, Isaria, and Nomuraea exhibit a defined in vivo dimorphic developmental program. This program involves switching between apical to budding growth providing mycopathogens with both tissue-invasive and vegetative growth capabilities. The budding yeast-like vegetative cells absorb nutrients in the hemocoel without apparent damage to tissues allowing the insect to continue to feed and develop. The ability to switch cell phenotypes is crucial for successful in vivo development. N. rileyi exhibits a defined developmental program that involves the sequential production of cellular phenotypes designed to perform spatially and temporally unique functions. Upon reaching the nutrient-rich hemolymph the penetrant germ tube switches from an apical to a budding growth program leading to the formation of freely circulating hyphal bodies. The yeast-like hyphal bodies grow exponentially in the nutrient-rich haemolymph reaching densities that far outnumber circulating hemocytes. As a critical threshold density is achieved, these hemolymph-borne cells synchronously revert to an apical growth program forming the tissue-invasive cell phenotype. The ensuing mycelial phase produce and secrete a suite of metabolites that can modulate host development, that rapidly kill the host, and that efficiently digests insect tissue leading to the mummification of infected larvae. In this presentation investigation we detail the hyphal body to mycelial transition of Nomuraea in the insect host, provide evidence for quorum-sensing that is produced and released into the hemolymph, and detail the extraction and examination of the elicitors that mediate the dimorphic switch.

Sirex noctilio is a woodwasp of Eurasian origin that was inadvertently introduced to the southern hemisphere in the 1900s and to North America over a decade ago. It attacks various Pinus species and cause significant mortality in pine plantations. Sirex noctilio is associated with a symbiotic white rot fungus, Amylostereum areolatum, which females inject into trees when they oviposit and which is required for survival of developing larvae. We examined the genetic diversity of A. areolatum isolated from S. noctilio and other woodwasps collected from Europe in comparison with samples from northeastern North America to determine origin of introduction(s). Multilocus genotyping of nuclear ribosomal regions and protein genes revealed two widespread multilocus genotypes (MLGs) among the European samples, one of which is present in the US. The other US S. noctilio-associated A. areolatum represented unique MLGs, although variation was primarily due to the laccase gene, with the other loci having conserved sequences. The closest relative to these US strains is a German strain with identical ITS, mtssu and tef sequences. These findings indicate multiple introductions of S. noctilio to North America from Europe or from Europe via South America. Our results also showed lack of fidelity between wasp hosts and Amylostereum species, and we found a North American woodwasp carrying an A. amylostereum MLG likely introduced by S. noctilio. These results underscore the need to study North American siricids and their fungal symbionts as S. noctilio continues to spread in North America.

Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight mass spectrometry has been tested and proven to be a rapid and inexpensive approach closely replicating the results of gene sequence-based analyses to identify species in such major entomopathogenic fungal genera as Metarhizium and Beauveria. While MALDI-TOF cannot replace PCR-based approaches for identifications or phylogenetic studies and cannot demonstrate relationships among fungi, it does appear to be extremely valuable for rapidly detecting anomalous isolates that need further detailed PCR-based study. This mass-spectrometric technique may be extremely valuable for ecological and population biology studies, as well as offering significant support for the efficient curation of large culture collections holding hundreds to thousands of isolates for which verified MALDI-TOF profiles are available. In comparison to the results obtained from the more routine analyses of (still) small numbers of individual genes, MALDI-TOF uses large numbers of cell proteins to group samples and, therefore, monitors much larger proportions of a total organismal genome; evidence will be presented that such a more complete coverage of the total genome suggest the existence of biogeographical groupings that may not be easily detected by PCR-based studies.

Beauveria caledonica is a pathogen of a number of insects, especially Coleoptera. Occurrence has probably been underreported due to the morphological similarity the ubiquitous entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana. Recent phylogenetic studies have shown that B. bassiana sensu lato is really a species complex. The genomic differences between species of Beauveria can assist understanding of the importance of selected gene in disease and ecology of these fungi. We report on initial comparisons of the genome of B. caledonica strain isolated in New Zealand and B. bassiana. The genome was sequenced using 3 lanes of a MiSeq by NZGL (New Zealand). 15,890,840 150-bp read pairs were obtained for the 32-Mb Beauveria strain (~149 fold coverage). After assembly using the programme ABySS, a total of 10,951 contigs were obtained over 39 bp and an N50 of 21676, with 2827 over 500 bp. Preliminary comparisons were conducted on a range of phylogenetic, secondary metabolite and mitochondrial gene regions. Assembly of the mitochondrial genome was used to assess completeness of the coverage. The genome sequence of B. caledonica shows significant divergence from B. bassiana.

Pandora formicae (Entomophthorales, Entomophthoro-mycota) is an obligate pathogen of the common red wood ant, Formica rufa. The fungus, similarly to other fungi of this group, enters the host body through cuticle, where it exploits nutritional resources within the haemocoel. When the infected ant is close to death, the fungus triggers a change in host behavior, manipulating it to climb a leaf (e.g. grass) or a twig. The fungus attaches the moribund host with rhizoids, the host legs grasp around the leaf or twig and the mandibles bite to vegetation and lock. Then the host dies and soon after the fungus breaks through the cuticle with conidiophores producing asexual spores. This quick transformation requires activity of several enzymes involved in cuticular breakdown, cell wall formation, and other processes. To study this, we have constructed transcriptome libraries of the last two stages: 1) when the ant is just dead with no fungal growth outside except the rhizoids, and 2) when external conidiophores are present. This first de novo transcriptome of an entomophthoralean fungus, in interaction with host, provides accurate insight into the plethora of genes expressed during final stages of infection, crucial for fungus transmission and reproductive success.

The entomopathogenic oomycete Lagenidium giganteum is known to infect and kill mosquito larvae and therefore has been seen as a potential biological control agent against disease vector mosquitoes. However, little is known about the pathological process of L. giganteum in its mosquito host. In order to detail the molecular basis of entomopathogenicity, a transcriptome analysis was initiated for L. giganteum, using various Next Generation Sequencing technologies. Homology searches have led to the annotation of ca. 20,000 transcripts based on significant similarity to known proteins and revealed a full complement of plant pathogenic oomycete effector orthologs. The characterization of full-length transcripts corresponding to Cellulose Binding Elicitor Lectin (CBEL), Crinkler, and elicitin proteins demonstrated that L. giganteum is the first described animal pathogenic oomycete to secrete canonical Crinkler and CBEL effectors. In addition, phylogenetic analyses identified a Glycoside Hydrolase 5 (subfamily 27; GH5_27) as a putative virulence factor. Genome mining indicated that GH5_27 orthologs are shared by entomopathogenic oomycetes and fungi, but virtually absent in all other oomycetes and fungi. Using PCR, GH5_27 fragments were amplified and sequenced from additional entomopathogens, suggesting that oomycete and fungi underwent convergent evolution and that GH5_27 proteins may play a crucial role in insect/microbe pathosystems. Detailing the molecular basis of entomopathogenicity may allow for the use of oomycetes and fungi as control agents against insect pests, reducing the use of insecticides that can have negative impacts on the environment and human health.

Bacillus thuringiensis strains are well-known for the production of insecticidal proteins upon sporulation and these proteins are deposited in parasporal crystalline inclusions. The majority of these insect-specific toxins exhibit three domains in the mature

toxin sequence. However, other Cry toxins are structurally and evolutionarily unrelated to this three-domain family and little is known of their three dimensional structures, limiting our understanding of their mechanisms of action and our ability to engineer the proteins to enhance their function. Amongst the non-three domain Cry toxins, the Cry34Ab1 and Cry35Ab1 proteins are required to act together to produce toxicity to the western corn rootworm (WCR) Diabrotica virgifera virgifera Le Conte via a pore forming mechanism of action. Cry34Ab1 is a protein of ~14 kDa with features of the Aegerolysin family (Pfam06355) of proteins that have known membrane activity, while Cry35Ab1 is a ~ 44 kDa member of the Toxin_10 family (Pfam05431) that includes other insecticidal proteins such as the binary toxin BinA/BinB. The Cry34Ab1/Cry35Ab1 proteins are important solutions for control of WCR having been developed as insect resistance traits in commercialized corn hybrids for control of WCR. The structures of Cry34Ab1 and Cry35Ab1 have been elucidated to a resolution of 2.15 Å and 1.80 Å, respectively. The solution structures of the toxins were further studied by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and native electrospray ion mobility mass spectrometry. We present here the first published structures from the Aegerolysin and Toxin_10 protein domain families.

Cry5B is a three-domain crystal protein that attacks nematodes. In collaboration with the laboratory of Partho Ghosh, the three dimensional structure of Cry5B has been solved. Cry5B shows significant similarities with three-domain insecticidal crystal proteins in domains I and III but significant differences with insecticidal proteins in domain II. To better understand structure function relationships in Cry5B, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the entire toxin domain in which each point variant was tested in bioactivity assays with the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Alanine point variants were classified into three classes—those with reduced/no bioactivity, those with relatively normal bioactivity, and those with increased bioactivity against C. elegans. More than 400 point variants were successfully tested. Some of those in the latter class (increased bioactivity) have been selected for further study, including fully quantitative analyses and testing their spectrum of increased action against other nematodes. Our results, as well as their implications for crystal protein – nematode interactions, will be presented..

Address for Correspondence: Berry@cf.ac.uk
A knowledge of the structure of insecticidal toxins is a major benefit in elucidating mode of action and is, therefore, fundamental for targeted mutagenesis to test mechanistic hypotheses, to alter target range and increase toxicity. Crystal structures of activated 3-domain toxins, Cyt toxins, Vip2, Mtx1 and anthrolysin are available and can be used to model structures for related proteins. There remains a significant

76

number of potent invertebrate-active toxins that do not fall within these classes. Crystallography is labour-intensive, requiring large quantities of pure, mono-disperse protein and often proves difficult. Recent developments in the field of in silico, ab initio structural modelling allow the generation of models in the absence of related sequences in the protein structure database. This may allow us to predict protein structures and use these predictions to develop testable hypotheses for the modes of action of the toxins. This procedure has been applied to several non-3-domain toxins and toxin-associated proteins. For one such protein, a structure is proposed, consistent with a pore forming mechanism of action. Analysis of secondary structure content is consistent with this model and evidence of pore formation has been produced. Mutagenesis of a region known to be important in structurally-related toxins was shown to eliminate toxicity. While further study is clearly required, modelling, thus, allows us to predict and test hypotheses related to the mode of action of toxins for which experimental structures are, as yet, unavailable.

In addition to the conventional 3-domain Cry proteins, the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis can also harbor other classes of insecticidal toxins with distinct structures, receptors, and modes of action. Among them are a group of proteins that share significant similarities to MTX2/3 toxins at the structural level, but are very divergent at the amino acid sequence level. In this presentation, we will discuss the general features of these MTX toxins, and agriculture applications for the control of insect pests.

Parasporin-2 (PS2) is a crystal toxin isolated from parasporal inclusions of Bacillus thuringiensis A1547. PS2 has a strong cytocidal activity in liver and colon cancer cells without showing a typical insecticide. Accumulated molecular, cellular and in vivo experimental observations on PS2 indicate that the protein form a pore in membrane with a mega size assembly. The crystal structure of active PS2 monomer reveals that the protein elongates like a short rod, comprising almost β-strands. The polypeptide folding is similar to a class of aerolysin-like β-poreforming toxins while there is no homology to insecticidal Cry toxins. N-terminal domain of PS2 is rich in aromatic residues and forms a groove which could be capable to grapple the target molecule. Amino acid substitutions of PS2 in the region indicate that the residues could be involved in cell-binding. The Cterminal domain contains β-sandwiches and the surface of the protein has a unique extensive track of exposed side chains of serine and threonine where thought be related to PS2 oligomerization and membrane pore formation. Single-particle EM analysis reveals that PS2 oligomer shows a ring shape with the 24nm length, 8 nm diameter and a 4nm pore while a structure of pore-forming aerolysin is the ring-like mushroom structure with a central pore. We would like to introduce current observations on anti-cancer toxin PS2 in vitro and vivo in this symposium.

MICROBIAL CONTROL 2

Photorhabdus luminescens and asymbiotica live in the gut of entomopathogenic nematodes, which invade insect larvae, where they release the bacteria. Here, the bacteria produce toxins, which kill the insects. We studied tripartite Tc toxins from P. luminescens and a novel toxin (PaTox) from P. asymbiotica. Tc toxins consist of three components TcA, TcB and TcC, which occur in several isoforms. TcA is responsible for the binding and up-take of the toxin, B is a linker and C carries the biological activity. Recent crystal structure analysis revealed a novel type of syringe-like injection mechanism, which depends mainly on TcA but needs all components (1). We studied the biological activity of TccC3 and TccC5, which are isoforms of TcC. TccC3 ADP-ribosylates actin at threonine148, thereby actin polymerization is enhanced (2). TccC5 ADP-ribosylates Rho proteins at glutamine61, a modification which persistently activates of Rho GTPases. Both modifications of actin and Rho proteins induce clustering of the actin cytoskeleton (2). The P. asymbiotica toxin PaTox glycosylates Rho proteins by attaching GlcNAc at tyrosine32/34 (3). The modification inhibits Rho signaling, because Rho activation and interaction with effectors are blocked. In addition, PaTox harbors a deamidation domain, which activates heterotrimeric G proteins, including Gq/11 and Gi family proteins. Functional consequences of the

Malaria, one of the most deadly vector-borne diseases in the world, is transmitted by the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito. Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis (Bti) is a gram-positive, aerobic, spore-forming bacterium that produces crystalline inclusions that contain insecticidal proteins. Bti has been shown to be highly insecticidal to larvae of mosquitoes and blackflies, but is considered to have weak insecticidal activity against non-dipteran invertebrates in aquatic environments. Few studies have comprehensively studied the non-target effects of Bti under reproducible and standardized conditions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of Bti on key non-target invertebrates in a highly reproducible synthetic multi-species system, the

77

standardized aquatic microcosm (SAM) system. The SAM system is initiated in a chemically defined medium with synthetic sediment and is inoculated with nine different species of photosynthetic microorganisms (PMOs) and different non-target invertebrates. Replicate SAMs were inoculated with a LD90 of Bti strain HD-522, whereas the control SAMs were not inoculated with Bti. Over a period of 2 months, the abundance of PMOs and invertebrates were determined by biweekly sampling. Differences between Btitreated and control SAMs were assessed by statistical analyses of sampling data and biological diversity indices. The contributions of the SAM experiments to our understanding of the non-target effects of Bti are discussed.

spores on tomato fruits ranged in all experiments between 4.9x104 und 8.5x104 cfu/ g fresh weight. For single application of Bt a max. spore concentration of 4.7x104 cfu/g fresh weight was measured corresponding to the laboratory experiments and the experiments at a commercial farm. To proof the degradation Bt spores over time samples were taken after the last application over one week. Over all experiments the concentration of Bt spores was reduced up to only 46 to 77 % of the initial spore concentration within one week. A distinct reduction of Bt spores on fruits was achieved by modifying the application strategy. When only the upper parts of the tomato plant were treated with XenTari, a maximum concentration of Bt spores of 3.3 x 103 cfu / g fresh weight was recorded.

Plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs) are serious pathogens of many other crops. Yellow cutworm Agrotis segetum is a serious insect pest of vegetable and grains. After liquid fermentation of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) strain 00-50-5, the cell-free supernatant (CFS) and the crystal protein toxins (CPT) have high activities against the root-knot nematode (RKN) Meloidogyne incognita and the yellow cutworm A. segetum. The mortality for second-stage RKN juveniles (J2) was 100% as early as 5 hrs after exposure to 0.909µg.mL-1 of dried CFS. The LC50 values were 0.037- and 0.015µg.mL-1 of partially purified Bt exotoxin at 5 hrs and 24 hrs after exposure, respectively. The mortality of A. segetum was 100% for firstinstar larvae (L1) after exposure to 10µg.mL-1 CPT for 72 hrs. The LC50 value for A. segetum L1 was 0.417µg.mL-1. An SDSPAGE of the purified 00-50-5 CPT resulted in four main proteins with 133-, 60-, 27- and 25 kDa after treatment with 1%SDS, and three proteins with 133-, 60-, and 27-kDa after treatment with 0.1N NaOH. The Bt 00-50-5 has dual nematicidal and insecticidal activities against soil-dwelling pests, such as M. incognita and A. segetum.

The biocontrol product dianem® contains entomopathogenic nematodes, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora. It is officially registered in Austria as a plant protection product to control larvae of the Western Corn Rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera). Field results from Hungary, Austria and Italy applying 2 x 109 nematodes per ha obtained equally high control like chemical seed dressings with neonicotinoides or application of granular insecticides containing the pyrethroide Tefluthrin. Adapted application technology has been developed to apply nematodes with 200 ltr. of water/ha directly on the seeds. Although the insect larvae occur approximately a month later, the nematodes persist long enough to control the pest. Insects penetrate into the roots where they are not easily reached by insecticides, whereas nematodes follow the insects into the galleries and kill the larvae 2-3 days after infestation. Latest field results, which have used the novel application technology, will be presented. Since product costs reach almost the same level like chemical insecticides and since the seed treatment with neonicotinoides was banned by the European Commission in 2013, the product dianem® is in commercial use for the first time on larger scale against this invasive maize pest.

Ten plant extracts were tested as ultraviolet protectants to improve the persistence of Spodoptera littoralis multiple embedded nucleopolyhedrovirus (SpliMNPV). In an initial test, the SpliMNPV alone or in combination with 10 plant extracts, each at a concentration of 1% was exposed to ultraviolet B (UV-B) for one hour. Among them, five plant extracts, viz. cloves, henna, green tea, pomegranate and grape showed a high rate of virus protection with original activity remaining

78

(OAR) at 100 %, 97 %, 91 %, 90.6 %, and 77 %, respectively. However, lemon, kiwi, olive, dates and beetroot extracts provided lower protection with OARs of 71 %, 58.4 %, 53 %, 21 %, and 18 %, respectively. Using the same UVB source, secondary screening was carried out on the five best additives from primary screen, and tested at a concentration of 0.5% and using an exposure timing of 5 hours. Clove and henna showed the highest rate of protection with OAR of 96.6% and 76.5%, respectively. In addition, absorption spectra and the obtained protection rate were correlated. These laboratory findings are very encouraging and that field studies are underway.

The majority of studies of pathogens are conducted with one pathogen species or even strain and one host species, although in nature numerous pathogens and other parasites form a community attacking a host, and even attacking the same host individual. We conducted studies of natural enemy interactions using Lymantria dispar larvae, the fungal pathogen Entomophaga maimaiga, the viral pathogen LdMNPV and parasitoids, all of which have been introduced to North America. Studies in low density populations were conducted in central New York State over 16 years and high density populations were studied at 59 sites in the mid-Atlantic region in 2009, when an outbreak population was crashing. We found very different interactions at low versus high host population densities. At low host density, E. maimaiga and parasitoids were both fairly abundant and LdMNPV infections were almost nonexistent. At virtually all higher density sites the emergent E. maimaiga was most abundant. Virus infection was positively associated with host density while E. maimaiga and parasitoids were both frequency dependent. E. maimaiga and parasitoids co-occurred in the same larvae less than expected and LdMNPV and parasitoids co-occurred in the same larvae more than expected while the fungus and virus reproduced in the same cadaver as expected, suggesting little interaction. This pattern of co-occurrence suggests that the two semelparous natural enemies (fungus and parasitoid) seldom successfully share a host larva while the iteroparous virus was more successful in co-inhabiting with either E. maimaiga or parasitoids.

The discovery of Oryctes nudivirus (OrNV) in the 1960s by Dr Alois Huger enabled the successful management of coconut

rhinoceros beetle (Orytes rhinoceros) populations through classical biocontrol release in the Pacific, SE Asian, and Indian Ocean regions. OrNV continues to be an important biocontrol agent for the control of Oryctes rhinoceros in both coconut and oil palm growing regions. Augmentative release of OrNV is commonly used to enhance the natural spread and ensure its continued presence within palm growing regions and surrounding areas. For over four decades after the distribution of the virus, O. rhinoceros was not reported to have established in any new regions. However, in 2007 the beetle was discovered in Guam and the population has now established with a highly damaging outbreak such as those not seen for 40+ years. Initial attempts to introduce OrNV into the Guam population were unexpectedly unsuccessful. This has raised the possibility the O. rhinoceros population that invaded Guam is less susceptible to OrNV, or potentially resistant. Furthermore, near the end of 2013, a population of O. rhinoceros was detected in Hawaii, although it is not believed to have established yet. The discovery of new O. rhinoceros invasions within the Pacific region linked with the possibility of a virus tolerant population suggests the beetle may again be on the move. To assist efforts in identifying the source populations for the Guam outbreak, a simple PCR-RFLP method has been developed to distinguish Guam O. rhinoceros from other populations. Analysis of several O. rhinoceros populations has demonstrated that the Hawaiian beetles are of the same haplotype as those found in Guam. We will discuss current results in relation to what is known about these new invasions and potential implications for the future.

The aim of the present study was to control Candida albicans with liposomal formulation of essential oil of S. hortensis incorporated into an ointment. Also toxicity of the liposomal essential oil of S. hortensis was investigated by MTS assay analysis on L929 mouse fibroblast cell lines. The liposomal formulations were designed using thin film technique and liposomes were properly incorporated into the ointment. The chemical composition of the essential oil obtained from S. hortensis was determined by GC and GC-MS analysis. The liposomal essential oil of S. hortensis was tested against Candida albicans with disc diffusion assay and micro-well dilution assay. Then the toxicity of liposomal essential oil on mammalian cells was determined with MTS analysis. The results of antifungal tests showed that the essential oil of S. hortensis incorporated into the ointment and liposomal essential oil formulation have potential antifungal activity against Candida albicans. MTS assay results showed that a concentration of 10-7 % liposomal essential oil formulation is the safe dose for L929 mouse fibroblast cells. This liposomal formulation dramatically increases antifungal activity by improving cellular intake without side effects on mammalian cells.

Infection of an insect by a baculovirus occurs in two distinct phases, an initial infection of host midgut by occlusion-derived virions (ODVs) and subsequent systemic infection of other tissues by budded virions (BV). A vast majority of investigations of the infection process have been restricted to cell culture studies using BV that emulate the systemic phase of infection. In the current study we investigate baculovirus gene expression in ODV infected midgut cells. We have focused on the critical first phase of in vivo infection by Mamestra configurata nucleopolyhedrovirus-A in M. configurata larvae, using qPCR and RNAseq mass sequencing strategies to examine virus gene expression in midgut cells. The earliest genes detected by each method had significant overlap and included known early baculovirus genes as well as genes unique to MacoNPV-A and genes of unknown function. The RNAseq datasets also revealed a large range of expression levels across most ORFs. These datasets provide a whole genome transcriptomic analysis of viral genes required for virus infection in vivo and will provide the basis for functionally analyzing specific genes that may be critical elements in baculovirus midgut infectivity and host range.

Ecological and genomic adaptations underpin evolutionary processes. Nucleopolyhedroviruses, enclosing many virions in their occlusion bodies, evolve as populations of genomes, adapting to particular ecological niches. We previously showed that all the possible variation is present in a genome population of the size of baculoviruses. When adapting to a new niche, genome populations should differentiate. We conducted experimental evolution on AcMNPV wild type population by passaging 10 times through 4 different host species, in 10 replicates. We then characterised the genetic make up the original and evolved baculovirus populations by ultra-deep Illumina sequencing and their phenotypes by virulence bioassays. We were able to compare virulence components (time, dose and yield) to population diversity. Our experiment allowed us to follow the evolution of a population of genome and its phenotype in different environments to link

fitness with genomic changes. From all the evolved populations, different profiles emerge, with different relations between intra-population variation and fitness. Actually, it seems that all the species that have evolved on a host show a reduction of intra-population variation while increasing fitness on this host. But when looking at the generalist potential of the population, a lower diversity doesn’t always bring a lower fitness. Of course, there are variations in these results that seem to be modulated with the primary fitness of the virus to the infected host; spectacular fitness increase can emerge when infecting a very resistant host. These results give new indications in the evolution of the relation between fitness and genetic diversity.

Cotesia congregata develops as a gregarious endoparasitoid into larvae of the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta. The parasitoid wasp has evolved virulence strategies using an obligatory viral symbiont from the Polydnavirus (PDV) family named Cotesia congregata bracovirus (CcBV). CcBV particles are produced by specialized cells of the wasp ovaries and are injected along with the eggs into the host body and act by manipulating host immune defenses, and development, thereby enabling wasps to survive in a potentially harmful environment. In the caterpillar host, the expression of only a few selected candidate virulence genes had been studied, and so far we lacked a global vision of viral and host gene expression. To identify viral and host gene regulation during parasitism we performed a large-scale transcriptomic analysis by 454 sequencing of two distinct immune tissues (fat body and hemocytes) of the host M. sexta isolated in four experimental contexts: (i) non-treated M. sexta; (ii) parasitism of M. sexta by C. congregata; (iii) immune stimulation of M. sexta by heatkilled bacteria; (iv) parasitism of M. sexta by C. congregata followed by bacterial challenge. Following this analysis, we were able to identify 76 CcBV genes and 1993 M. sexta genes expressed 24hrs after parasitism. The data obtained allows us to draw for the first time a functional map of the CcBV genome, and to visualize at a global level M. sexta genes that are regulated during parasitism. This type of analysis will help us to highlight viral virulence genes that play an essential role in the hostparasitoid interaction.

High-throughput sequencing allows quantifying the viral biodiversity by studying the diversity of endogenous viral ORF and discovering new virus pathogens of impacting host species. A total of 114 non-model wild animal species from 33 taxonomic groups (i.e. 441 individual transcriptomes) were screened. Virus detection pipeline started with de-novo assembly of Illumina reads and prediction of 17 million ORF. Protein annotation was performed by a sequence homology search. Taxonomic assignment of each ORF was finally achieved using the NCBI taxonomy database. Viral ORF from 8 species of termites, mosquito, ants, crustacean and marine annelid were analyzed thus far. We detected 146 viral ORF, i.e. 10 viral ORF per host species, mostly related to dsDNA viruses. Genomic analysis showed that their (G+C) content was at intermediate level between those from host genes and from exogenous viruses, suggesting a genuine and recent viral origin. Viral ORF were shorter than their exogenous counterparts but still expressed: their function might have thus been retained. This result illustrated potential cases of viral gene domestications by the host’s genomes. A dozen of complete viral genomes were identified thus far; mostly RNA viruses. Molecular phylogenies allowed assessing the taxonomic position of the viruses. Lake sinai virus-like (LSV; unclassified ssRNA virus) were discovered in ants and solitary bees. LSV was recently discovered in honey-bees associated with colony collapse disorder. LSV-like discovery in non-Apis insects suggests that hymenopterans could act as a viral reservoir toward domesticated bees. This work illustrated the great potential of our method for high-throughput virus discovery.

Horizontal transfer (HT) of DNA is an important factor shaping eukaryote evolution. Although several hundreds of eukaryoteto-eukaryote HTs of transposable elements (TEs) have been reported, the vectors underlying these transfers remain elusive. Here, we show that multiple copies of two TEs from the cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni) transposed in vivo into genomes of the baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) during caterpillar infection. We further demonstrate that both TEs underwent recent HT between several sympatric moth species (T. ni, Manduca sexta, Helicoverpa spp.) showing different degrees of susceptibility to AcMNPV. Based on two independent population genomics data sets (reaching a total coverage >330,000X), we report a frequency of one moth TE in 8,500 AcMNPV genomes. Together, our results provide strong support for the role of viruses as vectors of TE HT between animals, and they call for a systematic evaluation of the frequency and impact of virus-mediated HT on the evolution of host genomes.

To evaluate genetic diversity of Lymantria dispar multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (LdMNPV) at the genomic level, five isolates of LdMNPV from North America, Europe, and Asia were selected for complete genome sequence determination. These isolates consist of LdMNPV-2161 from Korea; LdMNPV-3029, a sample of the product Virin-Ensh, from Russia; LdMNPV-3041 from Japan; LdMNPV-3054 from Spain, and LdMNPV-Ab-a624, a plaque isolate from a sample collected in Massachussetts, USA. The genome sequences of these isolates were co-linear with the genome sequence of the reference isolate LdMNPV 5-6, derived from the Gypchek product. LdMNPV 5-6 ORFs ld31, ld66, and ld133 were not found in the other five isolates, while all other ORFs annotated for isolate 5-6 were present in at least one other isolate. The greatest degree of sequence divergence among the isolates was observed among the bro genes, especially in the two clusters of bro genes between chitinase (ld70) and ld76 and between ld111 and dutpase (ld116). A 2-nt deletion in the enhancin gene vef-2 (ld160) of LdMNPV-Ab-a624 resulted in a frameshift and truncation of the vef-2 ORF, while a deletion in LdMNPV-3041 entirely removed vef-1 (ld65). Bioassays against the New Jersey Standard Strain of L. dispar did not indicate any reduced pathogenicity due to mutation or deletion of vef genes in either isolate 3041 or Ab-a624. In bioassays against L. dispar from Japan, Russia, Europe, and North America, isolates 2161, 3029, and 3041 exhibited a greater degree of pathogenicity against neonate larvae than a sample of Gypchek at the lower dose range.

The study of drivers of species diversification is complex due to the entanglement of numerous ecological factors defining ecological niches. By their nature, viruses provide a confined system of interactions to study diversification from micro to macroevolution. Virus ecological niches are clearly defined by their hosts, which consequently should primarily drive virus evolution. Baculoviruses (BVs) have been well studied, showing the peculiarity of BV life cycle with the dissemination of viral particles on insect host plants. This strongly suggests that host plants may play an important role in their evolution. Here we study phylogenetic patterns of host use in the large radiation of BVs that attack the insect order Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies). We generated a phylogeny for ~500

81

BV isolates using four core genes (polh, lef-8, lef-9, pif-2) from which we delimited virus species, to obtain a comprehensive timed molecular BV species phylogeny. We then used a combination of phylogenetic (BV and insects) and ecological (host range of BVs, host plant range of lepidopteran hosts) data to address the following hypothesis: BVs are host specialists and show high levels of phylogenetic conservatism, BVs have the same ages as their lepidopteran hosts and the host plants of the insects drive also the evolution of BVs. We found that in general, hosts primarily induced BV species speciation over a short timeframe. But on a larger evolutionary scale, the insect-host co-evolutionary relationship signal is confused. Surprisingly we revealed that insect host plant specificity contributed largely to BV evolutionary history.

Among 28 isolates of Beauveria bassiana tested for virulence against F. occidentalis in laboratory bioassays, we found strain SZ-26 as the most potent, causing 96% mortality in adults at 1×107 mL-1conidia after 4 days. The effect of the strain SZ-26 on survival, longevity and fecundity of the predatory mite Neoseiulus (Amblyseius) barkeri Hughes were studied under laboratory conditions. The bioassay results showed that the corrected mortalities were less than 4 and 8% at 10 days following inoculation of the adult and the larvae of the predator, respectively, with 1×107 conidia mL-1 of SZ-26. Furthermore, no fungal hyphae were found in dead predators. The oviposition and postoviposition durations, longevity, and fecundity displayed no significant differences after inoculation with SZ-26 using first-instar larvae of F. occidentalis as prey in comparison with untreated predator. In contrast, the preoviposition durations were significantly longer. Observations with a scanning electron microscope, revealed that many conidia were attached to the cuticles of F. occidentalis at 2 h after treatment with germ tubes oriented toward cuticle at 24 h, penetration of the insect cuticle at 36 h, and finally, fungal colonization of the whole insect body at 60 h. In contrast, we never observed penetration of the predator’s cuticle and conidia were shed gradually from the body, further demonstrating that B. bassiana strain SZ-26 show high toxicity against F. occidentalis but no pathogenicity to predatory mite.

The current study was conducted to determine if wheat seeds co-inoculated with the insect-pathogenic fungus Metarhizium (three species) and the mycoparasitic fungus Clonostachys rosea are protected from both insect pests and plant pathogens. The experiment was done in two parts: First, a coinfection bioassay was performed to determine if the virulence of Metarhizium was affected by the presence of other fungi by co-treating Tenebrio molitor larvae with combinations of Metarhizium, C. rosea, and the wheat pathogen Fusarium culmorum. Second, wheat seeds were co-inoculated with the both beneficial fungi and compared to single inoculations of the effects on F. culmorum when allowed to grow for two weeks under controlled laboratory conditions. The resulting root systems were then placed with T. molitor larvae which were evaluated daily for mortality. Pathogenicity to insect persisted in all treatments, but Metarhizium virulence was affected by co-treatments with other fungi. Root-infection by F. culmorum was not reduced directly by the presence of Metarhizium while C. rosea reduced F. culmorum infection and this effect was not diminished in combination with Metarhizium. The results of this study suggest that combination of beneficial fungi may effectively protect roots from both pathogens and insects pests..

The red palm weevil, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), and the moth Paysandisia archon (Burmeister) (Lepidoptera: Castniidae) are considered nowadays the most important palm pest worldwide. Current tactics commonly used to manage the weevil are based on chemical control, although the use of these compounds is hampered by several environmental concerns. In recent years, the R. ferrugineus (Rf) microbial control potential of entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) has been highlighted. In this work, several strains of EPF have been isolated from diverse naturally infected specimens of both species, found in different countries through the Mediterranean Basin. Firstly, the usefulness of the elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1-α) region, the nuclear intergenic region BLOC and inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) or microsatellite markers were assessed as R. ferrugineus EPFs diagnostic tool, alone or in combination, and relationships among the Mediterranean Beauveria and Metarhizium isolates obtained from the red palm weevil were inferred. Secondly, the effect of diverse environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity and UV-B radiation were assessed on germination and colony growth of these EPFs strains as function of their genealogy and geographic origin. Finally, virulence of selected isolates was tested against both Rf larvae and adults. Our results show a distribution pattern of Beauveria bassiana through the Mediterranean Basin, possibly associated with the host insect dispersion, with the same genetic group presented throughout the European distribution area of phytophagous. Furthermore, several differences were observed between the different genetic groups found, regarding the different factors analyzed: temperature, humidity, UV-B radiation and virulence.

The prospect of utilising entomopathogenic fungi, such as Beauveria spp., as endophytes to enhance their biological control activity is presently a highly topical area of research. However, the endophyte-host relationship is complex and the associated methodology for defining and recovering endophytic strains wrought with problems. A review of the literature on endophyte isolation methods indicated the need for developing a methodology for reliable molecular detection of Beauveria spp. in planta. The method that was developed included a stringent surface sodium hypochlorite and ethanol based sterilisation with the protocol optimized specifically for propagules of Beauveria spp.. This was followed by treatment of plant tissue with propidium monoazide (PMATM) to exclude surface DNA contamination from subsequent PCR. A nested PCR/RT-qPCR protocol capable of detecting as little as 32 fg was developed using novel primer sets designed from the translation elongation factor 1-α gene (TEF). Additionally, epiphytic DNA was isolated separately using a benzyl chloride treatment in order to determine any corresponding occurrence of Beauveria with endophyte positive samples. Freshly inoculated samples of Zea mays and Solanum lycopersicum were surface sterilized using the optimized method and various controls were included for comparison to determine at which stage(s) B. bassiana remained viable. Results suggest that Beauveria DNA contamination and viability after surface sterilisation is a common and confounding issue associated with endophyte detection and isolation. However, this may be overcome with the improved methodology described here, which delivers reliable detection of endophytic strains.

Patterns of host adaptation in fly infecting Entomophthora species

Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Denmark
Address for Correspondence: hhdefinelicht@plen.ku.dk
Insect pathogenic fungi (IPF) differ widely in their capability to infect different hosts. Some are generalists and will, given a sufficient number of infectious spores are present, infect almost any species of insect (e.g. Hypocrealean Metarhizium and Beauveria). Members of a different main IPF phylum Entomophthoromycota generally have more narrow hostranges where some species for example only infect aphids or only locusts. Certain species (or strains) are even more host specific and are only known to infect a single or very few taxonomically related insect species under natural conditions (e.g. Entomophthora, Strongwellsea and Entomophaga). Species diversification of the obligate IPF within Entomophthoromycota thus seems to be primarily driven by co-evolutionary host adaptation to specific insect families, genera or species-complexes, but the underlying genetic factors of host adaptation in this fungal order are largely unknown and leave many unanswered questions. For example are the numbers of virulence factors increasing, or decreasing when fungal pathogens adapt to a narrow range of potential hosts? And, are host specialization based on many genetic changes with small effect or few with large effect? Here we examine closely related species within the Entomophthora muscae species complex: E. muscae s. str. infecting the common housefly Musca domestica and E. muscae s.l. strains infecting the cabbage fly Delia radicum. We use RNA-seq based comparative transcriptomics to unravel genetic differences and similarities in order to detect patterns of hostspecific molecular adaptation.

Pandora formicae (Entomophthorales, Entomophthoromycota) is a pathogen of the common red wood ant (Formica rufa), causing symptoms of “summit disease”, where ants attacked by the fungus place themselves on an elevated position before death and sporulation, enabling the pathogen to release infectious spores widely. This facilitates fungal transmission but puts the ant colonies at an enhanced risk of a lethal disease outbreak. Ant workers, on the other hand, respond by removing the cadavers from the nest surroundings, by that lowering the load of conidia, but at the same time putting them at risk while protecting the colony from this hazard. Detailed mapping of the cadavers around an ant nest, twice a day for three subsequent days, three times during one season, shows how ants’ behavioral response keeps the fungus prevalence ‘at hold’. It also shows the uniqueness of this interaction, the only known example of an entomophthoralean fungus infecting a social insect host, and an evolutionary adjustment of fungal

The potential of entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) to live as endophytes in various plant tissues has been demonstrated several times in recent years. However, the effects of plant colonization by these endophytes on the metabolism of the colonized plants have been only rarely addressed. We analyzed the volatile organic compound (VOC) profiles of tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicon) inoculated with three strains of Beauveria bassiana and a plant pathogen biocontrol agent (Trichoderma koningiopsis) compared to control plants. We hypothesized that EPF colonized plants should be more attractive for herbivores, mediated by the VOC profiles, but should not exhibit differences when colonized by the plant pathogen antagonist. We found that B. bassiana and T. koningiopsis inoculated plants had significantly modified VOC profiles, with marked differences between different isolates. Some of the compounds up- or down-regulated are known to play a role in plant-herbivore interactions such as α-pinene, ß-

83

cymene, α-Terpinolen, ß-Phellandrene, Caryophyllene and αCaryophyllene. When aphids (M. persicae) were allowed to colonize these plants, VOC profiles again differed with regard to specific compounds and the amount produced. However aphids did not discriminate between tomato plants inoculated with different endophyte isolates compared to control plants. We speculate that the VOC pattern found may play a role for attraction of natural enemies (parasitoids), competing with the EPF for the herbivores.

simultaneously for aphid control, it is possible for lacewing larvae to become infected with microsporidia when infected eggs are eaten. The main objective of this study is to determine if microsporidia from lady beetles (T. hippodamiae and N. adaliae) are transmitted to green lacewings and to examine the effects of these pathogens on lacewing larvae and adults.

Effects of the microsporidium Nosema adaliae on the multicoloured Asian lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis

Scotia, Canada Address for Correspondence: susan.bjornson@smu.ca
Originally imported for use as a biological control agent for pest insects, the multicoloured Asian lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis Pallas has itself become a pest in many areas of the world. While it is very effective for biological control, H. axyridis tends to displace many native lady beetle species and the alkaloids produced by these beetles may affect the palatability of wine and have adverse effects on human health. The geographic distribution of H. axyridis extends throughout North America into Nova Scotia and overlaps with the range of the native two-spotted lady beetle, Adalia bipunctata L. The microsporidium Nosema adaliae was recently found in a native population of A. bipunctata from Nova Scotia and the geographic overlap of A. bipunctata with H., axyridis provides the opportunity for this microsporidium to be transmitted horizontally to H. axyridis in nature. In this study, H. axyridis larvae were provided with a combination of uninfected and N. adaliae-infected eggs. All of the H. axyridis larvae that consumed N. adaliae-infected eggs became infected with the pathogen. H. axyridis larval development was prolonged significantly, depending on the number of eggs eaten. These results suggest that there is potential for N. adaliae to be transmitted to H. axyridis in nature if the larvae consume a sufficient number of microsporidia-infected eggs.)

The status and preliminary findings for full genome sequencing of two distantly related species of microsporidia with mosquitoes as type hosts will be presented. Vavraia culicis, the type species of the genus Vavraia, was originally described from Culex pipiens. Type material was not available and therefore Vavraia culicis floridensis isolated from Aedes albopictus in Florida was used for sequencing. V. culicis has a broad mosquito host range, is infectious for several species of Lepidoptera and characterized by having only uninucleate stages and produces uninucleate spores in multisporous sporophorous vesicles. Edhazardia aedis is the type species for the genus and has a limited host range in mosquitoes but can only complete its life cycle in Ae. aegypti. E. aedis is polymorphic, producing 4 distinctive spore types. It is transmitted both horizontally and vertically and requires 2 generations of the mosquito host to complete the life cycle. Genome and transcriptome sequencing for E. aedis and V. culicis floridensis is completed. V. culicis floridensis has a genome size of approximately 6.1Mb while E. aedis is nearly an order of magnitude larger at approximately 51.3Mb, yet the gene content difference is smaller, with 2,773 and 4,190 predicted genes in V. culicis and E. aedis respectively. RNAseq data has been analyzed for multiple time points in the life cycle of each species to validate predicted gene structures and to examine gene expression. Preliminary analysis of genome evolution and differential gene expression between life cycle stages will be presented.

The larvae of green lacewings, Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens), are generalist predators that feed on insect eggs, small caterpillars and other, soft-bodied insects. Lacewing larvae are commercially available for aphid control on various agricultural crops. It is common to use several types of biological control agents for controlling aphids at a given time to optimize pest control. Two-spotted lady beetles, Adalia bipuncata L., and convergent lady beetles, Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville, are often released for aphid control in the same areas that lacewings are used. Two microsporidian pathogens infect these lady beetle species. Because lady beetles and green lacewings are often used

Hepatospora, a recently erected genus, infects epithelial cells of the hepatopancreas of decapod crustaceans. We isolated Hepatospora sp. from three different crustacean hosts, inhabiting different habitats and niches; marine edible crab (Cancer pagurus), estuarine and freshwater Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis), and the marine mussel symbiont pea crab, (Pinnotheres piscum). Isolates were initially compared using histology and electron microscopy revealing variation in size, polar filament arrangement and nuclear development.

84

Despite these morphological differences, sequence analysis of the partial SSU rDNA gene did not provide the resolution for distinguishing the isolates (>99% similarity). To investigate relationships between isolates, purified spore samples from the parasite infecting E. sinensis, and C. pagurus, were prepared for Illumina sequencing. Six additional gene sequences were mined from the resulting genomic data (RNA polymerase, Arginyl tRNA synthetase, Prolyl tRNA synthetase, Chitin synthase, Beta Tubulin and Heat Shock Protein 70). Primers were designed based on the above gene sequences to compare isolates, and to assess corresponding sequences in the genome of the isolate infecting pea crabs. Concatenated phylogenies using sequence data from the six genes revealed that Hepatospora isolates from the three different crustacean hosts are likely to be a single species. As such, the concatenated phylogeny supported that derived from analysis of SSU rDNA. Given the host, ecological and morphological distinction of the parasites infecting these three crabs, we provide further support for the concept that morphology is an inappropriate discriminator for even closely related taxa within the phylum, Hepatospora may form a widely distributed parasitic ‘cline’ within the hepatopancreas of aquatic crustacean hosts.

Enterocytozoon bieneusi is responsible for most cases of microsporidiosis in humans. Interestingly, an intranuclear microsporidian recently isolated from edible crabs appears to be a close relative of this human parasite on SSU based phylogenetic trees. Since microsporidians are known to be devoid of functional mitochondria and rely solely on glycolysis and energy import from their hosts, it was interesting to find that genes coding for glycolytic enzymes were absent from the genome of both parasites. Also, more recent genomic analyses of Hepatospora spp., another crustacean parasite show a similar loss of glycolytic enzymes alluding to a single loss of glycolytic capabilities prior to the divergence of the Enterocytozoonidae lineage. Absence of glycolysis may be compensated by the increase in host-ATP availability created by the aggregation of host mitochondria around microsporidian meronts, a feature often observed in microsporidian infections. However, E. canceri is an intranuclear parasite and hence, physically walled off from the host mitochondria. This may highlight the presence of a novel host nuclei-dependent metabolic process. To this end, phylogenetic and structural domain analyses on the first enzyme of the glycolytic pathway, hexokinase has revealed that it is severely mutated in deep branching microsporidia hinting to a different substrate-specificity adaptation. Most intriguing is the adjunction of a PTPA domain on the hexokinase of E. canceri. This is the first time severe mutations of hexokinase conserved domains have been documented in eukaryotic cells and our current efforts are directed towards understanding whether these mutations are associated with loss of enzyme function.

Apis mellifera (European honey bee) has long been host to Nosema apis and Apis ceranae (Asian honey bee) to Nosema ceranae. Natural infections of N. ceranae were first discovered in A. mellifera colonies in 2005. N. ceranae has already replaced N. apis in the warmer European countries and. as an emergent pathogen, is very competitive. It has been found to be more better adapted to higher temperatures than N. apis and is considered more virulent than N. apis. Lab experiments have shown the differential effect of temperature on N. apis and N. ceranae with respect to spore germination and virulence of the pathogen within the host. Our study is based on a 10-year (2005-2014) cohort study of roughly 20 apiaries from north-east Germany, monitored in autumn and spring. Trend analyses show a significant increase in the prevalence of N. ceranae and a decrease in that of N. apis, suggesting the gradual replacement of N. apis by N. ceranae. Weather aggregates from different periods of the season preceding the colony sampling were tested against the proportion of infected colonies. They reveal considerable variability in their effects on Nosema prevalence. We are able to confirm, for the first time, the effect of seasonal temperatures on the prevalence of Nosema in honey bee colonies. Effect of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices were also tested as proxies for seasonal weather and were found to be reasonably good predictors of Nosema prevalence.

Characterising putative virulence factors of the bee pathogen Nosema ceranae Graham Thomas, Ken Haynes University of Exeter, UK
Address for Correspondence: gt259@exeter.ac.uk
Microsporidia are obligate intracellular eukaryotic parasites related to fungi, possessing greatly reduced genomic and cellular components. The microsporidian Nosema ceranae threatens the two economically important pollinators, honey (Apis mellifera) and bumble (Bombus species) bees and has been causally linked to colony collapse disorder. Nosemosis has a complex epidemiology affected by host, pathogen and environmental factors. Although a draft of the N. ceranae genome has been published, the molecular basis underpinning pathogenicity is not known. The lack of established culturing techniques and a tractable genetic system necessitates use of model systems for both host and parasite such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We hypothesis effectors essential to disease progression exist amongst N. ceranae secretome genes. In this study we have started characterising these genes using Gateway® cloning technology and identify candidate effectors by their expression in S. cerevisiae. We offer experimental data supporting the identities of NcORF-01664 and NcORF-01663 as polar tube proteins (PTP) 1 and 2

85

respectively and identify a putative PTP4 through their capacity to induce morphological deformities in S. cerevisiae. We also show two unknown proteins are targeted to lipid droplets which could function to mobilise resources from this energy-rich organelle. In the future we hope to confirm this function is retained in a system more closely related to the insect host tissue using the D. melanogaster Gal4/UAS method. Increased knowledge on virulence factors and disease progression will ultimately lead to disease mitigation.

Gammarids of the Kuban river basin were surveyed for microsporidia infections at two sites: a) Azov sea coast close to the river Protoka mouth and b) a quarry lake 11 km eastwards from the sea. At the first site, a population of Dikerogammarus villosus was abundant in the intertidal zone. In June, 5 out of 100 specimens displayed developed infections with a monomorphic microsporidium. Its ribosomal RNA gene sequence showed high (above 99%) similarity to Anncaliia algerae with no variability between isolates from individual hosts. In July, the microsporidia were absent in gammarids (N=100). At the second site, in the quarry lake and neighboring ditches, there was an abundant population of Gammarus sp. infected with a dimorphic microsporidium at the rates of 100% in May and 50-80% in June. Sequencing of four cloned SSU rRNA gene amplicons (ca 900 bp long) from an individual host sample produced four distinct (97.8-99.4% similarity) haplotypes, suggesting infection with multiple genetically distinct isolates or species of genus Dyctiocoela. The latter taxon unites common and widespread gammarid-infecting microsporidia and revealing a new species of Dyctiocoela in these hosts is quite expected. Conversely, the detection of an A. algerae-like parasite in gammarids is somewhat unusual, though logical given the broad host range of A. algerae and its ability to develop in amphipods upon injection of spores into the hemocoel. This pathogen has potential risk for human infection and should be taken into account when considering safety of public beaches. Supported by RFBR, 13-04-00284 and 14-0491176.

Larvicidal activities on myco-synthesized silver nano-particles (AgNPs) against filarial vector, Cx. quinquefasciatus. The AgNPs synthesized by filamentous fungus, Penicillium verrucosum. Characterized by UV-Vis spectrophotometer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, laboratory evaluation of fungus mediated silver nano-particle against larvae and pupae of Cx.quinquefasciatus. The characterization studies confirmed the spherical shape and size (3–24 nm) of silver nanoparticles. The efficacy of fungus AgNPs tested concentrations of 25 and 50 ppm against L1, L2, L3 and L4 instar larvae of Cx. Quinquefasciatus. The LC50 (LC90) values are 4.91 (8.13), 5.16 (8.44), 5.95 (7.76) and 7.83 (12.63) in L1 to L4 instar at 25 ppm. Whereas, LC50 (LC90) were 5.24 (8.66), 5.56 (8.85), 6.20 (10.01) and 7.04 (10.92) in L1 to L4 instars treated at 50 ppm. The mortality rates were positively correlated with the concentration of AgNPs. Significant (P<0.05) changes in the larval mortality was also recorded between the period of exposure against all instar of larvae of Cx. quinquefasciatus. These finding use of fungus synthesize silver nano-particles is a rapid, eco-friendly, and a single-step approach and potential mosquito larvicidal agents.

With increasing interest in entomopathogenic fungi as endophytes (EEPF) in biological control strategies, there is a need for more background information on the interaction of these fungi with their host plant metabolism. Several studies have already reported on changes in the dry weight of plants when endophytically colonized by these EEPFs; however, a more detailed understanding of plant-fungus-interactions is missing. We measured phytohormone levels in plants with regard to the hypotheses that i) EEPFs produce phytohormones as fungal secondary metabolites when growing within plant tissues or ii) that plants react to the presence of EEPFs by increasing/decreasing their phytohormone production. We inoculated the seeds of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) plants with one strain of Beauveria bassiana and three different strains of Metarhizium anisopliae, and grew these plants under standardized conditions in the greenhouse. We used LC-MS to analyse several phytohormones (including Salicylic Acid (SA), Abscisic Acid (ABA), Indolic Acetic Acid (IAA), Salicylic Acid Glucoside (SAG), and Jasmonic Acid (JA)) in eight weeks old leaves of these plants. The results will be discussed with regard to induced plant responses as well with regard to potential influences on herbivore-plantinteractions.

The sisal weevil was first recorded in Greece on May 2010 on ornamental plants of Agave sp. As the use of synthetic insecticides is prohibited in urban landscape areas the evaluation of potential biological control agents (BCAs) is essential. Indigenous strains of Isaria fumosorosea and Metarhizium anisopliae isolated from the soil and a strain of Beauveria bassiana obtained from a Rhynchophorus ferrugineus cadaver were chosen for evaluation. Infection of adults and larvae of S. acupunctatus was achieved by immersing individuals in aqueous conidial suspensions. Additionally, natural diet of insects was also immersed in conidial suspensions and provided to individuals, in order to assess effectivity of application through treated surface. Beauveria bassiana and M. anisopliae were applied in concentrations of 107 and 106conidia/ml while I. fumosorosea was applied at a concentration of 106 conidia/ml. Mortality was recorded daily for up to 11 or 21 days for larvae and adults respectively. The highest adult mortality was achieved by B. bassiana through contact application reaching 100%, followed by M. anisopliae (48±10% to 28±10%) and I. fumosorosea (40±6.3%). In terms of larvae, mortality in all bioassays reached 100% with the exception of the treatment of contaminated diet by I. fumosorosea conidia (20±11%). All cadavers produced visible mycelium on their surface within a week. Results indicate a high level of mortality at the most harmful life stage of the pest, even at low concentrations and a lower level of mortality at the mobile adult stage. Benefits of a low concentration application of fungi are discussed..

During invasion into insect hemocoel, some entomopathogenic fungi secrete toxins contributing to a successful infection. In response, insect cellular and humoral immune reactions are triggered. In this work, we studied by real-time PCR the expression pattern of B. bassiana genes involved in beauvericin, bassianolide, and tenellin biosynthesis throughout the infection process in nymphs of the kissing bug T. infestans. We also investigated the expression level of some bug proteins involved in the humoral immune response, i.e. prophenoloxidase, hemolectin and defensin. In conidia-treated insects, the expression of beauvericin synthetase, bassianolide synthetase, and tenellin synthetase peaked 6 days post-inoculation. In blastosporeinjected bugs (bypassing the insect cuticle) the expression level peaked 12 hours post-injection. Regarding insect immune response, conidia treatment induced higher expression of defensin and hemolectin, with values of 8.3 ± 1.1 and 2.7 ± 1.4 fold inductions, respectively. In blastosporetreatment, the expression level of all genes tested raised from 12 to 48 hours, reaching 9.3 ± 3.6 (prophenoloxidase) and 26.6 ± 5.4 (defensin) fold induction. These results help to understand at the molecular level the “arm race” taking place in insect hemocoel during fungal invasion.

In vitro and in vivo studies were developed to evaluate the compatibility of the six most common herbicides applied to the soil of olive orchards with Metarhizium brunneum EAMa 01/58-Su strain against medfly Ceratitis capitata preimaginals. The fungus demonstrated high in vitro compatibility with the six active ingredients in malt agar medium, with growth rates (a) ranging between 2.5 mm d-1 and (Glyphosate ) and 3.3 mm d-1 (Oxyfluorfen). This compatibility was also revealed in vivo by assaying the fungus towards medfly prepuratiating larvae in herbicide containing soil (at 1.0 x 108 conidia g soil-1). Even if there was a decrease of the M. brunneum level until 104-105 conidia ml-1 in the soil 15 days after inoculation, mortality rates, which were in the range of 70-80%, did not differ significantly to the controls, except the ones observed in soils treated Glyphosate and its herbicide combinations, in which a significant 50% reduction of virulence was detected. These results reveal a general compatibility of M. brunneum with the most common herbicides applied to the soil of olive orchards, whereas a mixture of the fungus in the tank of the atomizer for a simultaneous treatment beneath the tree canopy is recommend for all active ingredients except Glyphosate.

The Seed Corn Maggot and Metarhizium are Related to
Maize Yield in an Organic, Cover Crop-Based Farming
Systems Experiment

Park, PA 16802 USA Address for Correspondence: meb34@psu.edu
Organic farmers must largely rely on cultural practices and biological processes to prevent crop damage from pests. Many farmers are interested in using cover crop mixtures to gain production and ecosystem benefits, but there has been little research on the effects of cover crop diversity on arthropod pests and their natural enemies. The seed corn maggot, Delia platura (Diptera: Anthomyiidae), is an early-season pest of large-seeded crops in conventionally tilled systems. Insectpathogenic fungi in the genus Metarhizium commonly occur in agricultural soils and infect soil-dwelling arthropods. In 2013, we examined the effects of overwintering cover crop diversity, ranging from one to 7 species, on seed corn maggot fly emergence, Metarhizium detection, soil characteristics, and corn yield. Seed corn maggot was detected in post-plant emergence traps from all treatments in maize and soybean, with approximately 10 times greater numbers captured from maize compared to soybean. Numbers of flies captured were not related to level of cover crop diversity. Metarhizium was detected in all treatments, with similar average detection rates in maize and soybean. Detection of Metarhizium was not related to level of cover crop diversity. In multivariate analyses, numbers of emerged flies relates negatively to maize yield and detection of Metarhizium. Metarhizium detection relates positively to maize yield, soil organic matter, electrical conductivity, and Mg. The negative relationship between emergence of seed corn maggot flies and Metarhizium suggests that this fungus is a natural mortality factor for seed corn maggot at this site.

The soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura, is an invasive pest of primary agricultural importance in North America. Following its introduction in 2000, soybean yields dropped 11%, with the costs of management and yield loss estimated to be $1.6 billion over a 10 year period. Soybean aphids are managed primarily by application of chemical insecticides. We identified two viruses from the soybean aphid transcriptome and small RNA data that may have potential for use in soybean aphid management: Aphid lethal paralysis virus (ALPV)-Ames (Dicistroviridae) and Aphis glycines virus (AGV; unclassified). There is evidence for the presence of ALPV-like viruses in several different insects including the bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (Linnaeus), the honeybee Apis mellifera, and Western corn rootworm Diabrotica virgifera virgifera. AGV has a ~5 kb single stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome and forms a 30 nm particle. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of this virus is closely related to that of Euprosterna elaeasa virus (Tetraviridae), while the AGV coat protein (CP) is similar to those of plant Sobemoviruses. Based on RT-PCR of AGV RdRP sequence, AGV-like viruses appear to be present in two other aphid species, the bird cherry-oat aphid, R. padi and the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer). Notably, ALPV-Ames does not appear to be vertically transmitted in the soybean aphid, while AGV is 100% vertically transmitted. The different transmission strategies of these two viruses and the implications of 100% vertical transmission will be discussed.

Densoviruses are small insect parvoviruses infectious per ingestion for several lepidopteran species. Their potential as microbial control agents led us to focus on the understanding of motors driving the transmission of densoviruses in the environment. Natural dynamic of densoviral infections was never investigated although several metagenomic studies revealed the presence of densoviruses in samples from various origins (feces from bats, mosquitoes, marine samples like urchins…). In this study, we qualitatively and quantitatively characterized direct and indirect mechanisms leading to the transmission of a model viral species, Junonia coenia densovirus, on the model host Spodoptera frugiperda. We showed that cannibalism of infected individuals and bites between infected and uninfected individuals are major events in the transmission of JcDNV while exposition to contaminated feces and/or regurgitations contributes to widely disseminate the

Viruses with circular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genomes that encode a replication initiator protein (Rep) are among the smallest viruses known to infect eukaryotic organisms. Additionally, their rapid evolution rates have led to the emergence of some of these viruses as serious pathogens. Recent research indicates that the host range of eukaryoteinfecting circular Rep-encoding ssDNA (CRESS-DNA) viruses, which was previously thought to be restricted to plants and vertebrates, may include insects. To expand our knowledge of circular ssDNA viruses in invertebrates, this study surveyed CRESS-DNA viruses circulating among insect populations by targeting dragonflies (Epiprocta). Dragonflies are highly mobile top insect predators that accumulate viruses from their insect prey over space and time and, thus, can be used as ‘sampling traps’ to explore the diversity of CRESS-DNA viruses found among flying insects. Using degenerate PCR and rolling circle amplification coupled with restriction digestion, 16 CRESS-DNA viral genomes were recovered from eight different dragonfly species collected in tropical and temperate regions. Nine of the genomes are similar to cycloviruses and represent five species within this proposed genus, suggesting that cycloviruses are commonly associated with insects. Three of the CRESS-DNA viruses share conserved genomic features with the recently described fungal virus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum hypovirulenceassociated DNA virus 1. The remaining viruses are divergent species representing novel CRESS-DNA viral genera. The novelty of CRESS-DNA viruses identified in dragonflies using simple molecular techniques indicates that there is an unprecedented diversity of ssDNA viruses among insect populations.

Metagenomic sequencing has recently revealed the ubiquity of eukaryotic circular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses in the marine environment; however, a definitive host has not been identified for most of these viruses. Through direct examination of marine shrimp and crab species, this study surveyed the diversity of circular ssDNA viruses in economically and ecologically important crustaceans, linking these newly discovered viruses to their hosts and improving our understanding of the ecological impact of ssDNA viral infection in marine crustaceans. Viral particles were partially purified from specimen homogenates through filtration, DNA was then

88

extracted and amplified through rolling circle amplification to enrich for small circular ssDNA templates. The concatenated circular genomes were then digested with restriction enzymes and the resulting products (~1– 4 kb) were cloned and sequenced. Thirteen distinct ssDNA viral genomes were recovered from five crab species and three shrimp species. Putative encoded proteins share less than 60% identity with known viral proteins from members of the Circoviridae. The detected genomes exhibit four different genomic architectures revealing an incredible diversity of ssDNA viruses in shrimp and crabs. Ongoing work aims to propagate these viruses in insect cell lines and develop a system to assess viral infectivity and modes of transmission.

Recent studies in paleovirology have uncovered myriads of endogenous viral elements (EVEs) integrated in the genome of their eukaryotic hosts. These fragments result from endogenization, i.e., integration of the viral genome into the host germline genome followed by vertical inheritance. So far, most studies have used a virus-centred approach, whereby endogenous copies of a particular group of viruses were searched in all available sequenced genomes. Here we follow a host-centred approach whereby the genome of a given species (the crustacean isopod Armadillidium vulgare) is comprehensively screened for the presence of EVEs using all viral sequences available as queries. This search and downstream evolutionary analyses revealed that 56 EVEs corresponding to 11 different viral lineages belonging to 5 viral families (Bunyaviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Nimaviridae, Totiviridae) and one viral order (Mononegavirales) became endogenized in A. vulgare. We show that viral endogenization occurred recurrently during the evolution of isopods, that A. vulgare viral lineages were involved in multiple host-switches that took place between widely divergent taxa. Furthermore, 32 A. vulgare EVEs have uninterrupted open reading frames, suggesting they result from recent endogenization of viruses likely to be currently infecting isopod populations. Overall, our work shows that isopods have been and are still infected by a large variety of viruses. It also extends the host range of several families of viruses and brings new insights into their evolution. More generally, our results underline the power of paleovirology in characterizing the viral diversity currently infecting eukaryotic taxa.

Iteraviruses belong to a separate genus of the Densovirinae subfamily of the Parvoviridae family and includes three densoviruses, i.e. Casphalia extranea Densovirus (CeDNV), Dendrolimus punctatus Densovirus (DpDNV) and Bombyx mori

Densovirus (BmDNV). In this study, we used a SequenceIndependent Single-Primer Amplification (SISPA) method to detect the pathogens of larvae from three additional insect species (Papilio polyxenes, Sibine fusca and Danaus plexippus), killed by some unknown pathogen. Sequencing of the clones that were obtained and BLAST analysis revealed the existence of three previously unknown densoviruses (provisionally named PpDNV, SfDNV and DppIDV). The genome of the new densoviruses were cloned into pCR2.1-topo or pBluescript(SK-) vectors. These virus sequences (including ITRs) have high identities with CeDNV and BmDNV. The identical genome organizations indicated that these three new densoviruses should be classified in the Iteravirus genus. Together with the infectious clones of CeDNV and BmDNV, we investigated the expression strategies of five different iteraviruses (PpDNV, SfDNV, CeDNV, BmDNV, DppIDV). Total RNA was obtained both from LD cell line transfected by infectious clones of the iteraviruses and virus infected larvae (Papilio polyxenes). RACE methods were used to identify the 5’ and 3’ transcription ends. The nonstructural (NS) and structural (VP) genes were located on the same strand of the genome. The NS cassette consists of two genes with NS1 and overlapping NS2. The NS2 transcripts all start at 7 nts downstream of the NS1 start codon. Transcription starts for NS1 genes are close to the AUG of NSS1. NS and VP transcripts do not overlap. The four VPs were similarly generated by leaky scanning translation of unspliced mRNA. The VP transcripts just start 2nts downstream of the poly (A) motif for NS transcripts. Interestingly, poly (A) signals for VP transcripts all overlap with the stop codons of the VP genes.

Single-stranded DNA viruses are among the smallest viruses and include members of the Parvoviridae and Circoviridae families (linear and circular ssDNA viruses). In the past decades, PstDNV and AdDNV have been well-known viruses that have caused a severe impact on cultured shrimps and crickets. Here, we report the discovery and genome characterization of numerous novel denso- and denso-like viruses and, for the first time, new circoviruses from these hosts. During the last years, we received many cricket samples from North America that were negative for AdDNV. However, densolike particles have been observed by EM. Complete sequence of different viral genome have been isolated and cloned including one circular ssDNA viruses of 2.5 kb, an ambisense densovirus of 4.9 kb and a segmented brevidenso-like virus (3.3 kb). Meantime, large numbers of new ssDNA viruses were also isolated from cultured shrimp from Vietnam. Characterization of these viruses revealed 3 different, unrelated circoviruses of 1.7, 1.7 (the latter is not using the standard genetic code and may have been ingested) and 1.3 kb. We also discovered a new shrimp parvovirus of about 4.1 kb that is phylogenetically poorly related to any known parvovirus. Near-atomic structures of some cricket and shrimp parvoviruses were obtained by X-ray crystallography as well as their transcription strategy. These results demonstrate a great diversity of ssDNA-viruses infecting these economically important animals. Future work will be focused on molecular features of theses viruses for a further insight into the evolution and classification of ssDNA viruses.

Vine mealybug (VMB), Planococcus ficus, is one of the most damaging grapevine pests in the world, largely because it is a vector of grapevine leafroll-associated virus (GLRaV). Since interactions among VMB, GLRaV and grapevine are responsible for the extent of VMB damage and GLRaV spread, we investigated the relationships among the three organisms. The effect of GLRaV infection on VMB was determined using cDNAAFLP analysis and validated with RT-qPCR. It was found that VMB responds to GLRaV by activating only a few genes, and possibly also by endosymbiont mediation. The effect of VMB feeding on grapevine was investigated with microarray analysis and validated with RT-qPCR. Grapevine was found to respond to VMB feeding by mounting a weak response within a narrow window of time. These results are useful for understanding the interaction among the organisms in the VMB system, and limiting the damage caused in vineyards.

Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar, Lepidoptera) outbreaks can cause great damage to forestry across Europe. In order to control this pest, there is need for new insecticidal bacterial strains for the development of more effective biopesticides. The insect gut microbiota represents all aspects of microbial relationships, ranging from pathogenic to obligate mutualistic interactions. Latest investigations suggest that there is competition between individual opportunistic pathogens and that they are able to upregulate the production of virulence factors according to their density within hosts, what renders them interesting for use in combination with biocontrol agents. The objective of this work is to characterize the bacterial midgut community of L. dispar and to monitor 1) changes in diversity during its life cycle, 2) changes within larvae from spring to summer and 3) differences between individuals. Microorganisms were first analyzed using a culture dependent approach where midguts were extracted and plated on media. Growing bacteria were analyzed by colony characteristics - color, size, shape, opacity, margin, elevation and viscosity and then by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In a second step bacterial midgut communities were analyzed by a culture independent method using PacBio technology to sequence full length 16S rRNA genes. Results showed relatively simple composition of the gypsy moth midgut community. We observed differences between individual larva from the same time point and structural changes of diversity in bacterial communities over the season.

Insects remove and clean microbes from their surface by grooming behavior, which is considered as a behavioral defense against pathogen/parasite infection in some cases. It is well known that the insects like Drosophila melanogaster, which live in an environment littered with bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms developing on decaying material devote a lot of time to self-grooming which seems to contribute cleaning their cuticula from external particles. The mechanisms that trigger this behavior are still ambiguous, although grooming behavior was identified in many insects. In this work, we examined if D. melanogaster can sense microbe in their habitat and if they conduct any hygiene behavior like grooming after they have perceived microbe. To follow the behavioral reaction, we focus on a contact chemo-stimulus, which would activate taste neurons. Microbe, microbe-related compounds and standard chemicals were used as stimuli and influence of water and mechanical stimuli were removed by using Gal4-UAS system in control experiments. Grooming seems to be specifically triggered by the activation of taste neurons since flies showed strong cleaning behavior when contacted with taste stimuli.

The entomopathogen Bacillus thuringiensis is used to control various pest species of scarab beetle but is not particularly effective. Gut bacteria have diverse ecological and evolutionary effects on their hosts, but whether gut bacteria can protect scarabs from B. thuringiensis infection remains poorly understood. To investigate this we isolated 32 cultivable gut bacteria from Holotrichia oblita, Holotrichia parallela and Anomala corpulenta, and analyzed their effect on B. thuringiensis multiplication and Cry toxin stability. 16S rDNA analysis indicated that these gut bacteria belong to the Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla. A confrontation culture analyses of the 32 isolates against three scarab specific B. thuringiensis strains showed that the majority of the scarab gut bacteria had antibacterial activity against the B. thuringiensis strains. The Cry toxin stability analysis results showed that whilst several strains produced proteases capable of processing the scarab-specific toxin Cry8Ea, none were able to completely degrade it. These results suggest that gut bacteria can potentially affect the susceptibility of scarabs to B. thuringiensis and that this should be considered when considering future control measures.

The Med fly Ceratitis capitata Wiedemann (Diptera: Tephritidae) is a polyphagous species affecting many species of fruits and vegetables worldwide. Due to its high economical impact on crops, the management of this multivoltine pest is always necessary and mostly based on the application of various synthetic insecticidal formulations as foliage baiting or cover spraying. Besides the use of chemicals, the potential of entomopathogenic microorganisms (i.e. bacteria, fungi) against this pest has been highlighted. The lethal and sub-lethal effects of sporulated cultures of a novel B. cereus sensu lato strain lacking detectable cry genes and identified by its morphological and genetic features, have been studied in a larval based bioassay model. Sporulated cultures of this strain significantly reduced immature stages survival and development time, and the size of emerging Med fly adults. The toxicity has been associated to a specific parasporal fraction characterized through a proteomic approach (SDS-PAGE, 2D PAGE, LC MS/MS). The results of these analyses highlighted the possible role of different protein families produced also by other microbial entomopathogens and that have already been specifically associated to an insecticidal action. These proteins include molecular chaperones (GroEL), metalloproteases, aldehyde dehydrogenases, peptidases and other enzymes.

The Bacillus cereus group (Bcg) commonly occurs in soil and includes the pathogens B. cereus, B. thuringiensis and B. anthracis, differing in pathogenicity and disease spectrum. The insect pathogenic B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis (Bti) is available in products for augmentation biological control and has been applied worldwide to control larvae of the order Diptera. However, knowledge is limited on how long-term Bti application affects the structure of indigenous Bcg communities as well as the overall abundance of Bti. Based on new primer pairs targeting internal spacers located on the bacterial chromosome, group-specific quantitative PCR assays for Bcg and Bti in environmental samples were developed. On six occasions during the vegetation season, soil samples were collected in forest swamps and wet meadows which have been treated with Bti during the last 11 years as well as in untreated forest swamps, wet meadows and well-drained forests. Preliminary results from two of the time points indicate a decline of Bti abundance over time after the last treatment in wet meadows and forest swamps. These preliminary data also indicate that abundance of Bti in the untreated sites were lower than in the treated, independently of the sampling occasion. This study is coming up with the first

specific PCR-primers for Bcg and Bti that target chromosomal DNA. These new tools will be useful for investigating the abundance and diversity of Bcg members in various environments and thereby for assessing the resident insecticidal potential of this bacterial group.

Brevibacillus laterosporus is a pathogen of invertebrates and an antimicrobial species, morphologically characterized by a typical spore surrounded by a firmly attached canoe-shaped parasporal body (CSPB). The biocontrol potential in agriculture of this bacterial species, is not limited to invertebrate pests (insects in different orders, nematodes and mollusks) but includes also phytopathogenic bacteria and fungi. This broad-spectrum activity is associated to a wide variety of molecules, including proteins and antibiotics, it produces. Whilst there are significant differences among strains in terms of virulence, the results of the recent whole genome sequencing of strains LMG 15441 and GI9 revealed a conserved potential of this species to produce several polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, and toxins. Among genes encoding for putative toxins some show similarities to Lysinibacillus sphaericus mosquitocidal toxins. Employing a B. laterosporus-Musca domestica bioassay model, associated to a proteomic and gene expression study, we have analyzed the implication in the microbial action of specific proteins produced during different bacterial life stages. Based on these results, new insights into the pathogenicity against noxious Diptera will be discussed.

V. tasmaniensis LGP32, a facultative intracellular pathogen of oyster hemocytes, was shown here to release outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) both in the extracellular milieu and inside hemocytes. Intracellular release of OMVs occurred inside phagosomes of intact hemocytes having phagocytosed few vibrios as well as in damaged hemocytes containing large vacuoles heavily loaded with LGP32. The OMV proteome of LGP32 was shown to be rich in hydrolases (29.8 %) including potential virulence factors such as proteases, lipases, phospholipases, hemolysins and nucleases. One major

91

caseinase / gelatinase named Vsp for vesicular serine protease, which is homologous to the VesA serine protease of Vibrio cholerae, was found to be specifically secreted through OMVs in which it is enclosed. Vsp was shown to participate in the virulence phenotype of LGP32 in oyster experimental infections. Finally, OMVs were highly protective against antimicrobial peptides, increasing the minimal inhibitory concentration of polymyxin B by 16-fold. Protection was conferred by OMV titration of polymyxin B but did not depend on the activity of Vsp or another OMV-associated protease. Altogether, our results show that OMVs contribute to the pathogenesis of LGP32, being able to deliver virulence factors to host immune cells and conferring protection against antimicrobial peptides.

The insects belonging to the order Coleoptera are one of the most harmful insect groups in our country and in all over the world. Members of coleopteran cause serious damages in the agricultural fields and the forested areas and the warehouses. So far, efforts to control coleopteran pests have mainly involved the use of chemical insecticides. These agents can have undesirable side-effects on humans, plant and other animal species, particularly predators and parasites of pests. In this study, we proposed to develop a biological preparation (bioinsecticide) against coleopteran pests using an insecticidal isolate of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. tenebrionis (Mm2). Our results showed that the isolate has maximum growth at 30ºC, at pH 7 in Tryptic Soy Broth containing 1% NaCl. Its sporulation was supported in synthetic medium and the bacterial cell suspension was produced in pilot fermenter. Powder biopesticide was produced using this cell suspension and necessary formulation materials in the spray dryer. The physical and biological properties like wettability, suspensibility, particle size, moisture content, and viable spores of the formulated powder were determined and noted as 24 s, 80%, 10 µm, 5% and 10x1012 (CFU/gdw), respectively. Insecticidal activity of the product against Agelastica alni and Stophilus granarius adults in laboratory conditions were investigated. Mortality results were identified as 37% against S. granarius and 100% against Agelastica alni.

The taxonomic genus Rickettsiella (Gammaproteobacteria; Legionellales) comprises intracellular bacteria associated with a wide range of arthropods including insects, arachnids and crustaceans. Ultrastructural together with genetic evidence is provided for a Rickettsiella bacterium occurring in Germany in the common rough woodlouse, Porcellio scaber (Isopoda, Porcellionidae). The new bacterium is found very closely related to a Rickettsiella strain from California that infects the pill bug, Armadillidium vulgare (Isopoda, Armadillidiidae). Both bacterial isolates display the ultrastructural features described previously for crustacean-associated bacteria of the genus Rickettsiella, including the absence of well-defined associated protein crystals; occurrence of the latter is a typical characteristic of infection by this type of bacteria in insects, but has not been reported in crustaceans. As demonstrated by a molecular systematic approach combining multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) with likelihood-based significance testing, both bacteria despite their distant geographic origins - form a tight sub-clade within the genus Rickettsiella. In the 16S rRNA gene trees, this sub-clade includes other bacterial sequences from woodlice. Moreover, the bacterial specimens from P. scaber and A. vulgare are found genetically or morphologically different from each of the four currently recognized Rickettsiella species. Therefore, the designation `Candidatus Rickettsiella isopodorum´ has been introduced for this new lineage of isopodassociated Rickettsiella bacteria.

The gram-positive spore-forming bacterium Paenibacillus larvae is responsible for American foulbrood in honeybees. Four P. larvae genotypes could be distinguished via genotyping with ERIC-primers, ERIC I – IV, with genotypes ERIC I and II being frequently isolated form outbreaks worldwide. The most important phenotypic difference between the genotypes are the differences in virulence. Recent studies show that binary AB toxins play an important role in the infection mechanism, presumably in breaching the larval midgut epithelium as crucial step in pathogenesis. AB toxins usually consist of two subunits which are encoded either by the same or different open reading frames (ORF). The A subunit is enzymatically active and modifies a cellular target, e.g. by mono-adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosylation. Contrarily, the B subunit is responsible for cell surface receptor binding and the translocation of the A subunit into the cell. Recently, two binary AB toxins, Plx1 and Plx2, have been identified as virulence factors in P. larvae ERIC I. The study on further binary AB toxins in P. larvae will be

continued via exposure bioassays with knockout mutants. We aim at analyzing and characterizing the binary AB toxins in P. larvae in order to gain further insight into the pathogenic mechanisms of P. larvae.

The root-colonizing biocontrol agent Pseudomonas protegens CHA0 protect its plant hosts from fungal diseases by releasing toxic exoproducts into the rhizosphere. Remarkably, this microorganism might also function as a natural insecticide since it is capable of exhibiting potent oral and systemic insecticidal activity against various pest insect species. Recently, our group discovered an insecticidal protein toxin termed Fit, which makes essential contributions to insect killing. The Fit toxin gene fitD is located in a virulence cluster coding for a type I secretion system (FitA, FitB, FitC and FitE) essential for toxin transport and also for three regulators (FitF, FitG and FitH) of toxin expression. By using a ∆fitF ∆fitG ∆fitH triple mutant, in which each regulatory gene was individually reintroduced and expressed, we observed that the expression of the fitABCDE operon is positively regulated by the LysR-type regulator FitG and repressed by the response regulator FitH. We demonstrate that a phosphorylation of the conserved aspartate residue (D59) in the receiver domain of FitH is necessary to eliminate the repressive activity of the regulator, and that this residue is necessary for Fit toxin expression. Findings of an analysis of the heterologous expression of regulatory genes fitG and fitH in naturally Fit-locus deficient strains carrying a gfp reporter monitoring the fitA leader sequence activity strongly suggests that the LysR-type regulator FitG promotes Fit-toxin expression through specific binding to the promoter of the fitABCDE operon. These results allowed to improve the model explaining the regulation of Fit toxin expression in P. protegens CHA0.

Amplicons from the cry-gene conserved blocks and from cyt1 gene group were cloned and sequenced. Sequence analyses indicated that LBIT596 contains sequences identified within the cry5B and cyt1A gene families, while LBIT-107 contains sequences identified within the cry14 and cyt1A gene families. Interestingly one of the amplicons from LBIT-107 showed only 88% identity with the cry14A gene. These results indicate a potential use of these toxins against economically important parasitic nematodes.

Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner is a gram positive soil dwelling, aerobic bacterium which produces parasporal crystal (Cry) toxins that are highly specific and effective against insect species. During the course of isolation of native strains, B. thuringiensis AUG-05 was found the most effective with a wide range of activity against lepidopterans. Hence, studies were carried out on its fermentation in different media to evaluate the production of maximal Cry toxin as well as spore and colony forming unit (cfu) counts. Increase in concentration of the Luria Bertani [(LB), composed of casein, yeast extract and sodium chloride in 2:1:2 w/w)] medium in the fermentation broth from 1 to 2% enhanced cfu, spore and also Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab toxin content. Addition of 1% Wesson salt in 1% LB broth dramatically increased spore, cfu counts, and also that of Cry1Ac but not of Cry2Ab. Spore and cfu counts in media were positively correlated with Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab contents. Bt powders from each fermentation with varying ratios of Cry1Ac and Cry2A toxins were more toxic to the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera than the tobacco caterpillar, Spodoptera litura and. Of all media substituting LB with agroproducts, most did well in supporting B. thuringiensis culture except for medium VI and VII, suggesting need for balancing qualitative and quantitative nutrients in the medium for optimal growth of the bacterium. Medium consisting of 2% wheat flour, 2% soybean meal and 1% Wesson salt could be considered as an alternative to LB medium to achieve economy of production costs.

Crystal proteins from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are globally used in agriculture as biological control agents against insect pest, but its use as a nematicidal control agent is still under development. In this work, a total of 310 Bt strains were screened for activity against the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Strains LBIT-596 (serotype darmstadiensis) and LBIT-107 (serotype neoleonensis) showed significant toxicity levels. These strains were characterized by plasmid and RepPCR patterns, and flagellin gene sequencing. Preliminary bioassays of LBIT-596 and LBIT-107 spore-crystal complexes estimated LC50s at 63.36 and 76.33 µg/ml, respectively, and 24.2 and 24.99 µg/ml, respectively, when pure crystals were tested. SDS-PAGE protein content analyses of LBIT-596 crystals showed two proteins (35 and 130 kDa) before activation, which turned into lower molecular-weight proteins (28

A novel Bt strain, TK-E6, isolated from grove soil in Japan, produces a mosquitocidal inclusion body called crystal consisting of several Cry proteins during sporulation phase. We detected twelve genes belong to the cry family, by degenerate PCR from Bt. TK-E6. Nucleotide sequences of these genes were determined and deduced ORFs encoding 140 - 145 kDa Cry proteins were cloned into a Bt expression vector carrying cyt1A promoter and cry4A terminator. Each Cry protein was purified and used for mosquitocidal assay against Ae. aegypti larva, any protein, however, did not show the strong activity when used alone. These results suggested that there was a synergistic action with some proteins for mosquitocidal activity. Pulse-field gel electrophoresis analysis showed that Bt. TK-E6 had five

93

plasmids ranging 66 - 224 mDa. Southern hybridization experiments revealed that twelve genes we detected had been distributed on four of five large plasmids. Interestingly, insertion sequences and transposon structures are also found in the upand downstream of all genes. It is very possible that some DNA rearrangement of gene amplification occurred in both intra- and inter-plasmids during the evolutional process of Bt. TK-E6. Elucidation of structure of Bt. TK-E6 large plasmids is very important to know evolution of Bt. Therefore, we are analyzing the gene organization of large plasmids by the next generation sequencer.

Vip3 insecticidal proteins are produced by Bacillus thuringiensis during the vegetative growth phase and most of them have activity against lepidopteran species. Five B. thuringiensis Vip3A proteins (Vip3Aa, Vip3Ab, Vip3Ad, Vip3Ae and Vip3Af) and their corresponding trypsin-activated toxins were tested for their toxicity against eight lepidopteran pests: Agrotis ipsilon, Helicoverpa armigera, Mamestra brassicae, Spodoptera exigua, Spodoptera frugiperda, Spodoptera littoralis, Ostrinia nubilalis and Lobesia botrana. Vip3Aa, Vip3Ae and Vip3Af were the most active proteins. Vip3Af was the protein active against most of the species tested. Contrarily, Vip3Ad was non-toxic to any species. Agrotis ipsilon was the species most susceptible to the four active proteins, whereas O. nubilalis was tolerant to all Vip3 proteins tested, with just some susceptibility to Vip3Af. The results obtained will help to design new combinations of insecticidal protein genes in transgenic crops or in recombinant bacteria for the control of insect pests.

Second generation Bt crops (insect resistant crops carrying Bacillus thuringiensis genes) combine more than one gene coding for insecticidal proteins in the same plant to provide a better control of agricultural pests. Some of the new combinations involve co-expression of cry and vip genes. Since Cry and Vip proteins have different midgut targets and possibly different mechanisms of toxicity, it is important to evaluate possible synergistic or antagonistic interactions between these two classes of toxins. Three members of the Cry1 class and three from the Vip3A class were tested against Heliothis virescens for possible interactions. At the level of LC50, Cry1Ac

was the most active protein, whereas the rest of proteins were similarly active. However, at the level of LC90, Cry1Aa and Cry1Ca were the least active proteins, and Cry1Ac and Vip3A proteins were not significantly different. In the experimental conditions used, we found an antagonistic effect of Cry1Ca with the three Vip3A proteins and a slight antagonism of Vip3Af with either Cry1Aa or Cry1Ac. The interaction between Cry1Ca and Vip3Aa was also tested on two other lepidopterans. Whereas antagonism was observed in Spodoptera frugiperda, synergism was found in Diatraea saccharalis. In all cases, the interaction between Vip3A and Cry1 proteins was more evident at the LC90 than at the LC50 level. The fact that the same combination of proteins may result in a synergistic or an antagonistic interaction may be an indication of different types of interaction with the host depending on the insect species tested.

Anticarsia gemmatalis (velvetbean caterpillar) and Chrysodeixis (=Pseudoplusia) includens (soybean looper) are two important defoliating insects of soybean that cause economic damage in soybean producing regions in the Americas. Both lepidopteran pests are currently controlled mainly with synthetic insecticides. Alternative control strategies such as biopesticides based on the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins or transgenic plants expressing Bt toxins can be used and are increasingly being adopted. The studies on the insect susceptibility and mode of action of the different Bt toxins are crucial to determine management strategies to delay insect resistance. Also, these studies are necessary to help design pyramided transgenic plants involving more than one Bt toxin to ensure a crop long term protection. In the present study the susceptibility of both soybean pests to Cry1Ac and Cry1F has been investigated. Bioassays performed in larvae show that both insects are susceptible to these two toxins. Competition-binding studies using brush border membrane vesicles indicate that Cry1F and Cry1Ac share some, but not all, binding sites in midguts of both insects. Incomplete shared binding indicates that there are resistance management benefits from combining the two proteins in Bt soybeans. Additional information on the receptors involved in binding and consequent cross-resistance potential are needed to more fully understand the long-term durability of combinations of Cry1Ac and Cry1F to control these two pests.

Bacillus thuringiensis vegetative insecticidal proteins (Vip3A) have been recently introduced in important crops as a strategy to delay the emerging resistance to the existing Cry toxins. The mode of action of Vip3A proteins has been studied in Spodoptera frugiperda with the aim to characterize their binding to the insect midgut. Histological localization of Vip3Aa in the

94

midgut of intoxicated larvae using immunofluorescence showed that Vip3Aa bound to the brush border membrane along the entire apical surface. The presence of fluorescence in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells seems to suggest internalization of Vip3Aa or a fragment of it. Successful radiolabeling and optimization of the binding protocol for the 125I-Vip3Aa to S. frugiperda BBMV allowed the determination of binding parameters of Vip3A proteins for the first time. Heterologous competition was performed using different protein competitors with the aim to determine if they share the same binding sites with Vip3Aa in S. frugiperda BBMV and thus select the appropriate candidates to be used in combination with the later in transgenic crops.

Larvae of the Western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera) are the most devastating pest of corn in the US. Due to reports of field-evolved resistance, novel insecticidal proteins are needed as alternative candidates for expression in transgenic corn to control this insect pest. A novel insecticidal protein from a Gram negative bacterium (toxA) and a Cryderived protein (toxB) have been identified and developed, respectively, as candidates for expression in transgenic corn targeting larvae of D. v. virgifera. In this work, we used Tenebrio molitor larval midgut as a model to characterize toxin binding and histopathology of toxA and toxB proteins in coleopteran larvae, and then compared to histopathology in D. v.virgifera larval midguts. While both toxins bound to the midgut brush border membrane, differences observed in H&E stained histological sections and TUNEL assays support differences in the mode of action of these toxins in coleopteran larvae.

Role of ABC-C2 in the interactions of Heliothis virescens with its host plants and Bt toxins
Anne Karpinski, Yannick Pauchet, Heiko Vogel and David Heckel, Department of Entomology, Max Planck Institute for
Chemical Ecology, Jena Germany Address for Correspondence: akarpinski@ice.mpg.de
Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry toxins are widely used biopesticides for reduction of crop losses caused by larvae from species such as Heliothis virescens. Until recently, Cadherin was identified as the major receptor for Bt toxins, albeit Bt resistance was shown to be genetically linked to an inactivating mutation in an ABC transporter. ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters are transmembrane proteins that hydrolyze ATP in order to conduct transport and other cellular processes. To date, we have no insights into the physiological role of this specific ABC transporter as well as into its role in the Bt toxin mode of action. We aim to investigate whether ABC-C2, the specific ABC transporter implicated in Bt resistance, acts as a receptor to Cry toxins. Furthermore, we want to find out whether an inactivated (mutated) ABC-C2 could cause a trade-off between Cry toxins and host plant secondary metabolites in Bt resistant insects. To address these two hypotheses, we first heterologously express H. virescens Cadherin and ABC-C2 in Sf9 cells. In addition, feeding assays with two H. virescens populations, JEN2 (wild

type) and YEE (ABC-C2 mutant), are performed with different host plants as well as host plant secondary metabolites incorporated into artificial diet. The genes of interest were expressed successfully, generating the basis for our ongoing in vitro trials. Subsequently, the effect of different Cry toxins on transfected cells will be investigated. Our first feeding assays with homozygous Bt susceptible and homozygous Bt resistant insects revealed a trade-off between Cry toxins and host plant secondary metabolites

Cry8Da from Bacillus thuringiensis galleriae SDS-502 has insecticidal activity against both the larvae and adult of Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica Newman). The receptor determines the specificity of the insecticidal activity of Cry proteins and hence, in order to reveal the mode of action of Cry toxin, receptor identification is a necessary step. However, a receptor for Cry8-type toxin has not been identified in the Scarabaeidae family of insects. Therefore, we aimed to identify the receptor of Cry8Da toxin in larvae P. japonica BBMV. A ligand blot showed the Cry8Da toxin bound to 110 kDa and 40 kDa protein in the BBMV of larvae P. japonica. The 110 kDa protein had higher binding affinity than the 40 kDa protein. In order to identify the Cry8Da toxin binding protein in the BBMV of larvae P. japonica, it was purified by column chromatography. The result of mass spectrometry indicated that the Cry8Da toxin binding protein in the BBMV of larvae was aminopeptidaseN which is commonly reported as receptors for Cry toxins in Lepidopteran and Dipteran insects. The 106 kDa APN homologous genes in larvae P. japonica could be amplified by PCR using degenerate oligonucleotide primers designed from a conserved sequence of Coleopteran APN. The 106 kDa APN is truncated into two peptides and tested to confirm the ability of binding with Cry8Da toxin. This experiment indicated the APN in larvae P. japonica is the receptor for Cry8Da toxin.

A Whole Genome Approach to Determine Cadherins associated with Bt toxicity in the Diamondback Moth,
Plutella xylostella Youngjin Park and Yonggyun Kim Department of Bioresource Sciences, Andong National University, Andong 760-749, South Korea Address for Correspondence: happy2pyj@gmaill.com
Diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, is a main pest of Brassicaceae throughout worldwide and was first reported to evolve resistance to Bt toxins in field population. Cadherin has been known to be one of receptors of Bacillus thuringiensis Cry proteins and synergizes Cry toxicity against Lepidopteran, Dipteran, and Coleopteran insects by elevating a toxin oligomerization. Full genome analyses of several model insects suggest various number of cadherin genes in an organism and raise a fundamental question on which cadherin(s) is the Bt receptor. In a whole genome sequence of P. xylostella, 52 open reading frames were annotated to be cadherins, in which putative Bt receptors were chosen on the basis of three receptor motifs: a signal peptide, cadherin repeat, and transmembrane domains. Compared to other cadherins of P. xylostella

95

(PxCads), PxCad1 has the highest homology with other lepidopteran insect cadherins previously associated to the Bt mode of action. PxCad1 was expressed in all developmental stages especially in gut tissue. Expression of PxCad1 was suppressed by feeding its specific double-stranded RNA (dsPxCad1) in the third instar. The suppression of PxCad1 expression did not significantly influence on pupal and adult developments of P. xylostella. However, the larvae treated with dsPxCad1 (150 ng/larva) significantly reduced susceptibility to B. thuringiensis Cry1Ac toxin. In contrast, the dsPxCad1-treated larvae did not show any change in susceptibility to B. thuringiensis Cry1Ca toxin. Only one cadherin, PxCad1, out of 52 candidate cadherins is the Bt receptor and is responsible for the specificity to Bt toxin, Cry1Ac.

RNA Interference of Integrin subunit β1 Impairs Development and Immune Responses of the Oriental tobacco budworm, Helicoverpa assulta against Bacteria
Youngjin Park and Yonggyun Kim Department of Bioresource Sciences, Andong National
University, Andong 760-749, South Korea Address for Correspondence: happy2pyj@gmaill.com
Integrin is a cell surface protein that is composed of α and β heterodimer and mediates cell interaction with extracellular matrix or other cells including microbial pathogens. A full length cDNA sequence (2,517 bp) of a integrin subunit β1 (HaITGβ1) was cloned from the oriental tobacco budworm, Helicoverpa assulta. Phylogenetic analysis showed that HaITGβ1 was clustered with other insect β integrin subunits with the highest amino acid sequence identity (61%) to β1 of other Noctuidae such as Spodoptera exigua and S. litura. Structural analysis of the HaITGβ1 possessed all functional domains known in other insect β1 integrins. RT-PCR analysis showed that HaITGβ1 was expressed in all developmental stages and all tested tissues of H. assulta. Injection of double-stranded HaITGβ1 RNA (dsHaITGβ1) into third instar of H. assulta suppressed HaITGβ1 expression and resulted in significant delay from last larval stage to pupal stage. The dsHaITGβ1 injection significantly impaired nodule formation of H. assulta in response to bacterial challenge and hemocyte adherence. These results suggest that HaITGβ1 plays crucial roles in cellular immune responses as well as development in H. assulta.

A PCR-RFLP method was used to identify cry2A toxin genes in a collection of 300 strains of Bacillus thuringiensis were confirmed with cry2 gene. Of the 81 genes identified the vast majority appeared to be cry2Aa (32) and cry2Ab (46) on the basis of their RFLP pattern. Three genes showed a different pattern and were subsequently cloned and sequenced. The gene cloned from strain HD395 was named cry2Ba2. The proteins encoded by the genes cloned from LS5115-3 and DS415 shared enough similarity with existing toxins that their genes were named cry2Aa17 and cry2Ab29 respectively by the

toxin nomenclature committee. Despite this overall similarity these two toxins resembled natural hybrids with Cry2Ab29 resembling Cry2Ab for the majority of the protein but then showing identity to Cry2Aa for the last 60 amino acids. For Cry2Aa17, domains II and III resembled Cry2Aa whilst domain I resembled Cry2Ab. The toxicity of the recombinant toxins against three insects was tested, and it was found that the toxicity of Cry2Aa17 more closely matched the toxicity profile of Cry2Ab than that of Cry2Aa, thus implicating domain I in specificity determination. Analysis of all publically available Cry2Aa sequences identified other examples of natural hybrids.

Bacillus thuringiensis Cry3Aa toxin increases the susceptibility of Crioceris quatuordecimpunctata to

The spotted asparagus beetle, Crioceris quatuordecimpunctata (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is one of the most devastating pests of asparagus in China. Sprayed synthetic pesticides have been used to control C. quatuordecimpunctata damage, but they pose problems because of residues and harm to natural enemies. Neither the microbial coleopteran-specific toxin from Bacillus thuringiensis tenebrionis, Cry3Aa, nor the fungal pathogen Beauveria bassiana have sufficient activity to effectively control C. quatuordecimpunctata damage to asparagus. However, second instar C. quatuordecimpunctata larvae exposed to a sublethal dose of Cry3Aa toxin demonstrated significantly higher larval mortality when exposed to B. bassiana. Our results suggest that a combination of Cry3Aa and B. bassiana may be effective in reducing damage by C. quatuordecimpunctata larvae to asparagus.

Genomic analysis has revealed the presence of insertion sequences within 23S ribosomal RNA encoding genes of arthropod-associated Rickettsiella bacteria (Gammaproteobacteria). Secondary structure modelling shows that these insertions fulfill the structural criteria for RNase III processed bacterial intervening sequence (IVS) elements. IVS elements have previously been identified within the rRNA operons of several Alphaproteobacteria and occur comparatively frequently within Enterobacteriaceae, but not in Escherichia coli. In these bacteria, IVS insertion sites have been shown to be conserved with respect to deduced rRNA secondary structures. 23S rRNA gene insertions in Rickettsiella occur at one of these conserved loci, more exactly within rRNA helix 25, and at a previously unidentified insertion site within helix 72. Expression of the Rickettsiella 23S rRNA genes in the surrogate host E. coli by a plasmid replacement approach leads to rRNA fragmentation and thereby confirms that Rickettsiella insertion sequences at both sites can function as IVS elements. Given the

96

lack of sequence similarity with current GenBank database entries, IVS25 and IVS72 give rise to two unprecedented IVS element superfamilies. Whereas the IVS72 element is highly conserved across the full range of investigated Rickettsiella species and Rickettsiella-like bacteria, the sequence of element IVS25 strongly varies among different Rickettsiella strains. Using the sequence information available for both IVS elements, a PCR-based approach for the genus-specific identification and infra-generic characterization of Rickettsiella bacteria has been developed.

Type IV Secretion System (T4SS) substrates as potential virulence factors of arthropod-pathogenic Rickettsiella
bacteria Andreas Leclerque Institute for Microbiology and Biochemistry, Geisenheim University, Geisenheim, Germany Address for Correspondence: andreas.leclerque@hs-gm.de; leclerque@hotmail.com
Rickettsiella bacteria (Gammaproteobacteria: Legionellales) are intracellular pathogens of arthropods that multiply inside replicative vacuoles within host cells. Delivery of bacterial proteins across the vacuole membrane to the host cell’s cytosol is believed to be of key importance for successful infection and pathogenesis. Comparative genomic analysis of Rickettsiella and related bacteria has revealed the presence of a complete set of gene clusters presumably encoding a type IVB secretion system (T4SS) in two Rickettsiella strains of the pathotypes `R. melolonthae´ and `R. armadillidii´, i.e. infecting, respectively, the European cockchafer and the pill bug. Hypothetical Rickettsiella T4SS key components show high similarity to orthologs in the Dot/Icm systems of the related vertebrate pathogens Legionella pneumophila and Coxiella burnetii, and T4SS gene cluster organization is very similar in these bacteria. In Legionella and Coxiella, involvement of Dot/Icm systems and several of their substrates into infection and pathogenesis has been demonstrated previously. In Legionella, transcriptional regulation of both T4SS structural and substrate genes is most likely mediated by several bacterial two-component systems, but only one of these, PmrAB, seems to be conserved in the genomes of both Coxiella and Rickettsiella. Expression studies in the surrogate host Escherichia coli that lacks an own T4SS, have demonstrated that `R. melolonthae´ PmrAB drives expression from the promoter regions of the presumed homologous T4SS gene clusters. Comparative in silico analysis of PmrAB regulons reveals a very high degree of divergence in hypothetical T4SS substrates sets that is in line with expectations from the specific host-adaptation of these bacterial pathogens

larvae of various pest insects following oral or systemic infection. We are exploring global regulatory mechanisms that control insect pathogenicity of the plant-beneficial bacterium. Here, we provide evidence that altering cellular levels of polyphosphate (PolyP) may strongly impair insect pathogenicity in P. protegens. The polymer is known for its involvement in regulation of diverse cellular and metabolic processes contributing to bacterial survival and virulence. P. protegens mutants with deletions in ppk1, encoding a PolyP kinase, or ppx, encoding an exopolyphosphatase, had a markedly reduced capacity to kill larvae of the Large White Pieris brassicae following oral infection. Oral toxicity could be restored by reintroducing the respective intact alleles into the mutant strains. Deletion of ppk1 or ppx resulted in reduced in situ expression of a major virulence factor required for insect pathogenicity in P. protegens, i.e. the insecticidal toxin Fit, in insect larvae. We hypothesize that altering PolyP levels affects stress tolerance of P. protegens in the insect host thereby impacting virulence of the bacterium.

Paenibacillus larvae is the causative agent of the notifiable epizootic American Foulbrood of honey bees. Four genotypes, ERIC I - IV of this pathogen do exist, with only ERIC I and II being frequently isolated from outbreaks worldwide. Despite the importance of the disease, molecular and cellular details of pathogen-host interaction during pathogenesis of AFB in honey bee larvae are poorly understood. Recently, the surface layer protein SplA was identified and functionally characterized as the first virulence factor of the P. larvae genotype ERIC II. Through a gene-disruption strategy expression of the splA-gene was successfully interrupted. In infection assays, SplA-deficient P. larvae and the parental wild-type bacteria were compared and it was demonstated that lack of SplA expression resulted in a significant decrease in total mortality. To futher investigate the role of SplA in virulence of P. larvae, SplA has been expressed in in the natural SplA-deficient genotype P. larvae ERIC I. We will present our most recent data on this SplA-expressing ERIC I-mutant in respect to growth characteristic in the lab and in larvae and, most importantly, to virulence parameters in exposure bioassays when compared to the parental wild type strain and to naturally SplA-expressing ERIC II.

Host-parasite interaction is one of the most common and important type of interaction among species, which has a strong impact on species evolution. The signatures of this impact have been identified in genomes, natural communities and on a phylogenetic level. It is not surprising that many aspects of hostparasite relationships have received particular attention from evolutionary biologists. Paradoxically, one indispensible and basic property of host-parasite interaction, population size oscillations, has been overlooked as a factor in host-parasite

97

coevolution. Parasites, by reducing host fecundity and survival, strongly affect population size of the host, which very often is their only ecological niche. Already in the 1920s Lotka and Volterra showed that antagonistic interactions between species would lead to interdependent oscillations in their population size. However, most of the current models of host-parasite coevolution ignore population size changes or use a deterministic approach which cannot realistically imitate the finite nature of real populations. Similarly, in most experimental studies on host-parasite coevolution the population size is kept constant as a matter of good practice. To enhance a more realistic understanding of the coevolutionary dynamics, we performed laboratory-controlled evolution experiments with the model nematode host Caenorhabditis elegans and its microparasite Bacillus thuringiensis and specifically varied the factor population size. Here, we will show our results on temporal changes in host fitness and parasite virulence under different population size regimes.

The continuous exposition of a pathogenic bacterium in a host during a serial passage experiment (SPE) may drive the fixation of mutations that favour its growth and multiplication in the host environment 1. These changes that are usually associated with an increase in virulence, can be now traced during an SPE by whole genome sequencing of the evolved variants 2. Here we describe the set up and initial results of a SPE using a Bacillus thuringiensis crystal minus strain (Bt407 Cry-) 3 using Galleria mellonella larvae. A new infection protocol has been established which permits bacterial multiplication inside the intestine following force-feeding with spores. The genomes of experimentally evolved bacteria that show significant changes in virulence or persistence will be sequenced and compared with the initial parental strain. Such a global genome based approach of pathogen evolution analysis should allow us to describe the history of the events which arose during the evolution of the B. cereus group in one of its natural hosts and explain phenotypic variations based on genotypic differences.

Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are essential pollinators of various agricultural crops and fruit but also of many wild plants. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain honey bee health and prevent or cure diseases. The most contagious and fatal bacterial disease of honey bee brood is American Foulbrood (AFB) caused by Paenibacillus larvae, a Gram positive, spore-forming bacterium. Infection spreads among the whole hive, eventually leading to the loss of entire colonies resulting in considerable losses in apiculture. Despite the enormous impact of this disease and intensive research, molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis are still not fully understood. Recently we have identified and characterized four genotypes of P. larvae (ERIC I-IV) which differ, among other factors, in virulence. Here we present our data on immune inhibitor A (InhA), a metalloprotease which is exclusively secreted by P. larvae ERIC II. In homologs of other pathogenic bacteria, InhA has been shown to have multiple functions such as degradation of antimicrobial peptides and cleavage of tight junctions. Here we functionally characterize InhA of P. larvae by combining transcriptomic, proteomic and histological studies as well as in vivo exposure bioassays with wild type and mutant P. larvae, the latter being deficient in InhA expression.

To investigate the degree of individuals’ concept and awareness of insects, a survey study was conducted with students and adults living in Korea. The misconception rate for insects was about 50% for both students and adults, but it was lower for students and people who had experienced insect-related events than for adults and those who had not. The highest misconception rate was obtained in answer to a question about the basic structure of an insect. Most people had a high preference of insects. Significant differences and correlations for the preference of insects were found between students and adults, men and women, people who had experienced insectrelated events and those who had not. The experience of an insect-related event most influenced preference of insects. These results suggest that increasing people's interest in insects and utilizing insects in treatment situations may be beneficial for the field of mental healthcare.

The possible cross host-genus transmission of several honeybee viruses into native bee populations has recently been proposed. Given current pollination practices and the number as well as high levels of different viruses found in honeybees, the cross genus transmission of these viruses could have a dramatic impact on the health of native bees.
