Possibly invasive species hits ifit seedlings

A new, possibly invasive insect could mean catastrophe for Guam’s territorial tree, the ifit, if left unchecked.

Ruddy Estoy, a forester with the Department of Agriculture, said officials noticed that ifit seedlings were being “snapped in half” about two weeks ago at the Mangilao nursery.

“We noticed that a fair amount of them were being damaged. But we’re taking steps to contain it,” Estoy said. “We wouldn’t want another rhino beetle situation.”

Environmental officials are still working on a virus to depopulate and contain the invasive coconut rhinoceros beetle, which has caused noticeable damage to the island’s coconut tree population.

“The coconut tree is our tree of life, and the ifit is our territorial tree, it’s a symbol of our island,” Estoy said. “If worse comes to worst, ifit could find itself in a similar predicament.”

Preliminary examinations have led environmental officials to believe the insect could be a type of stemborer, insects that bore into vulnerable parts of plants to lay its eggs.

With regard to the ifit seedlings, officials said the stemborer attacks the soft tissue of seedlings, whereas in older plants they are known to attack the growing tips.

Although the department has grown ifit trees in its other nurseries, they just started growing ifit seedlings in Mangilao fairly recently.

This is the first time they’ve seen this type of damage at their facilities.

“We’re hesitant to call it invasive for now – at least until the sample results come back,” Estoy said. “This could be something that’s always been here, but due to specific conditions, it just started attacking now. But for now, we’re going to err on the side of caution and continue maintaining it here at the Mangilao location.”
