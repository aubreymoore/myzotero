Abstract-Biological control started in the Marianas in 1911. Biocontrol agents have been introduced to control herbivorous insects, weeds, dung, molluscs, livestock pests, mosquitoes and household pests. In all, 104 species of insects, two predatory mites, three snails, one nematode and four vertebrates have been intentionally introduced to Guam for the purposes of controlling 41 pest species. Of the insect species, 34 established, 48 did not establish, 5 established temporarily and the status of the rest is not known. Additional introductions were made to other islands in the Marianas. Among the pests most successfully controlled by biological agents were Achatina fulica, Aleurocanthus spiniferus, Aleurothrixus fioccosus, Aspidiotus destructor, Brontispa mariana, B. palauensis, t.:pilachna vigintisexpunctata philippinensis, Nipaecoccus viridis, Erionota thrax, Penicillaria jocosatrix, and Spodoptera litura. Two weeds, Lantana camara and Chromolaena odorata have been successfully controlled by herbivorous insects. Most attempts at biological control in the Marianas have been transfers of species successfully introduced elsewhere. Most species introduced from temperate climatic zones failed to establish. Species which established on Hawaii, frequently established on Guam as well. Reasons for failure to establish are varied. Against Homopteran pests, 58% of the introduced natural enemies established. The establishment rate against Lepidoptera and Diptera was low.
Introduction
The introduction of new pests is a serious and recurring problem on islands including Guam (Schreiner and Nafus, 1986; Beardsley, 1979). Because of these pests, the need for biological control programs has been apparent to island entomologists, and biological control has had a long history as an important and valued control technique. In the Marianas the introduction of exotic insects for biological control purposes began with the establishment of the Agricultural Experiment Station in 1911 and has continued to the present time.
In 1911, D. T. Fullaway imported and released the ladybeetle Cryptolaemus montrouzieri Mulsant for the control of mealybugs and parasites (Spalangia sp.) of various filth flies. Fullaway left in 1912, and no further biocontrol work was done until 1925 when a new entomologist, S. R. Vandenberg, arrived. During his tenure on Guam, Vandenberg imported parasites of the Asian corn borer Ostrinia furnacalis Guenee, filth flies, and Rhabdoscelus obscurus Boisduval. He also brought in coccinellid predators of various scales and mealybugs including Aspidiotus destructor Signoret and lcerya purchasi Maskell. Vandenberg worked from 1925 until 1932, after which the agricultural experiment station was closed.
In the 1930s, the Japanese, in particular the Japanese South Seas Development Corporation (Nanyokaihatsu kabushiki kaisha), introduced some organisms for biological control. Their introductions were made in the islands of Rota, Tinian, and Saipan, which

were under Japanese control. The most notable introductions were Trichogramma chilonis Ishii, an egg parasite attacking several species of Lepidoptera, Rodolia pumila Weise, and the drongo Dicroros macrocerus S. Baker. The drongo was released on Rota and eventually migrated to Guam, where it is now considered to be somewhat of a pest.
Biological control activities were largely suspended on Guam from the closing of the Agricultural Experiment Station in 1933 until after WWII. In 1947, the Department of the Navy asked the National Academy of Sciences to form an advisory board to survey the insects of the islands and to initiate biological control of the major pests. Work began in 1947 on several insects and continued until1954 when the committee discontinued the project. Under this program, G. Peterson made a series of releases of parasites or predators of Aleurocanthus spiniferus (Quaintance), Epilachna philippinensis Dieke, 0. furnacalis and Achatinafulica Bowdich. A program to control two fruit flies, Dacus cucurbitae and D. orientalis, was initiated in 1950, continued into the 1960s. Except for the introduction of fruitfty parasites, biocontrol efforts were largely suspended after Peterson left in 1957. About 1967 biological control activities were renewed and, by 1975, a large number of exotic natural enemies had been imported and released. Many of these natural enemies were introduced to control pests which had arrived on Guam in the 1950s or later. Most of the work was done by the Guam Department of Agriculture, principally by R. Muniappan, although R.N. Spencer also introduced species. After 1976, the focus of the biocontrol activity shifted from the Department of Agriculture to the Agricultural Experiment Station, which was established in 1976 at the University of Guam.
For purposes of discussion, we have divided the biological control activities into major groups including crop and plant pests, weed control, medical, household, and veterinary pests. Most of the discussion will be centered on biological control efforts after 1955, since many of the older projects have already been reviewed. Some review of these older cases is included for completeness, in particular where there is pertinent data which is not easily accessible in the literature. Reference to obscure literature, agency reports, and personal communications was necessary to ensure comprehensive coverage. Much of the information comes from unpublished reports of various agencies or offices, including the Hawaii Department of Agriculture, the Guam Agricultural Experiment Station, the Trust Territory entomologist, and the Saipan Department of Natural Resources.

Crop and plant pests
A listing of all the known, deliberate introductions of biological control agents and their establishment status is presented in Table I. A number of other beneficial species have become accidentally established in recent years or have switched from native species to exotic pests. A partial list of the more important species is given in Table 2.

SCALES AND MEALYBUGS

Mealybugs and Pulvinaria psidii
Scales and mealybugs were among the first targets of biological control in the Marianas. In 1911, Fullaway (1912) released the predaceous lady beetle C. montrouzieri to

Table I. Summary of the beneficial natural enemies introduced to control various organisms in the Mariana Islands. The years 1911 to 1988 are covered for the islands Guam (G), Rota (R), Aguijan (A), Tinian (T), Anatahan (An), Pagan (P) and Saipan (S). In relation to the level of control we arc adopting the following definitions: (H) high-populations of the target organism are low and it is no longer considered to be a problem; (G) good-populations of the target organism are usually low but outbreaks occur regularly; (P) partial-populations of the target pest are lower but it is still a significant pest; (U) unsuccessfulthe biocontrol agent established but had little or no effect on the target organism; (E) established-the biocontrol agent established but we have no information on its impact on the target; (T) temporary- the biocontrol agent established initially but later disappeared; (N) not established; (A) species present before being imported;(?) status totally unknown.

Shipment records of the Hawaii Department of Agriculture, The exact number released is not known, only the number shipped. 2 Reports of the Trust Territory Entomologist, Micronesia 3 Rao et al., 1971 list these as established but give no names or sources. Indicates that very few survived shipment and no indication of establishment is given. 4 Places of origin in parentheses refer to the original source of the natural enemy.
Reports of the Saipan Department of Natural resources 6 R. cardinalis has been replaced by R. pumila, an accidental introduction to Guam. R. cardinalis has not been collected on Guam since 1945. 7 Of this total 982 were field released and the rest were retained for rearing. An additional 4,819 were released from reared material. 8 The majority of the 65 were retained in an unsuccessful rearing effort. Only a very few were released. ' Of these 1113 were released, 477 males and 636 females. An additional20 females and 10 males were held for breeding. In 1928, an additional537 females and 313 males were bred and released. 10 Part of this shipment was held for an unsuccessful attempt at rearing. 11 Imported as T. australicum. A shipment identified only as egg parasite of 0. furnacalis was shipped from Taiwan. This is likely T. chilonis but could be another species as well. T. ostriniae Peng & Chang also occurs in Taiwan and is common in corn fields. 12 The occurrence of this parasite on Guam may be fortuitous or may have been introduced by the Japanese. No records of its introduction were found. 13 Which of the strains established and what their contribution to the control is, is not known. 14 The shipment was split and 100 were field released. From the 54 parasites held in the laboratory, an additional 3,275 were bred and released. 15 H. minuta and H. quadridentata were introduced as Leionota sp. Shipments were of both species in unknown proportions. 16 The shipments were sent to Guam and then split. A proportion was released on Guam and the rest on Saipan. No records are available to indicate how much was
actually released on each island. 17 0. importatus and 0. phaseoli were mixed in the shipment. The exact proportions released arc unknown although 0. importatus was probably more abundant. 18 The marine toad was credited with vastly reducing populations of the garden slug Veronicella leydigi Sirnroth (Anon., 1938) and providing some reduction of the banana corm weevil (Anon., 1937c). 19 S. macropus and S. don·ata were introduced but there is no record of for what or why. They were introduced to Hawaii as predators of the liverfluke snail Lymnae ollula Gould.

control mealybugs. Adults of the first generation were emerging in the field when Fullaway left in 1912 and no further follow-up on this release was made. Vandenberg reimported C. montrouzieri in 1925 for the control of mealybugs and the soft scale Pulvinaria psidii Maskell. The beetle is established, although no estimate of its effectiveness in controlling any of the mealybugs or P. psidii has ever been made. It has been noted to feed on several species of mealybug including Nipaecoccus viridis (Newstead) (Nechols and Seibert, 1985).

Aspidiotus destructor
Another scale which was the target of early biological control efforts was the coconut or transparent scale Aspidiotus destructor Signoret. In 1918, an outbreak of A. destructor took place which severely damaged many trees. The outbreak caused considerable concern, since the scale had killed between 70 and 80% of the coconuts on Yap and Saipan. This outbreak, which continued to be severe through 1924, lead to the importation of Rhyzobius satelles Blackburn(= Lindorus lophanthae (Blaisdell)) and Comperiella bifasciata Howard from California (Vandenberg, 1926, 1928), and two unidentified species of coccinellid beetles from the Philippines (Rao et a!. 1971). Although Rao et al. (1971) list the coccinellids as established, we doubt this since a status report of the Guam Agricultural Experiment Station states that few specimens survived shipment (Anon., 1925). No further mention of them or what species they were is reported nor is any indication given that they established. The attempts to establish R. satelles failed. Two shipments were sent but few beetles survived. The four or five survivors in the first shipment were consumed by ants during the rearing effort. The six survivors in the second shipment were successfully reared, and 22 progeny were released. These beetles did not do well in the release area as they were not able to compete with a native coccinellid which quickly eliminated A . destructor infestations in the release area (Vandenberg, 1928). A combination of the native predator and two parasites, a species of Aspidiotiphagus and Aphytis chrysomphali (Mercet), reduced the scale outbreak to unimportant levels by early 1926. The native coccinellid was called Cryptogonus orbiculus (Gyllenhal) by Vandenberg, but was actually Telsimia nitida Chapin (Esaki, 1952). C. orbiculus also occurs on Guam, however it is uncommon, and its hosts are unknown (Chapin, 1965). Later, attempts were made to ship T. nitida (as C. orbiculus) to Fiji, but the beetle did not survive shipment.
Cryptognatha nodiceps Marshall was sent to Guam from Fiji prior to 1959 (Rao et a!., 1971). No information is available about the shipment or the release. It has not been collected on Guam to date. In 1971, Rhyzobius satelles Blackburn (as R. pulchellus Montrouzier) was introduced to Guam from New Caledonia to aid in the control of coconut scales and citrus scales. A single specimen of R. satelles was recovered in 1978, indicating establishment. The beetle, however, is very uncommon; an intensive survey of coconut insects in 1984 yielded no specimens. A. destructor is not an economic problem on Guam at this time and appears to be controlled by a combination of T. nitida, Pseudoscymnus anomalus Chapin, and Chilocorus nigritus (F.). Both P. anomalus and C. nigritus apparently were fortuitous introductions. P. anomalus was first found on Guam in 1958. C. nigritus appeared in the 1960s and was abundant enough that it was shipped to Hawaii in 1972 for control of coconut scale. P. anomalus was also shipped at that time

Nafus & Schreiner: Biological Control

(Davis, 1972). T. nitida was shipped to Pohnpei from Saipan in 1939 (Esaki, 1952) and to Hawaii in 1936 to control the scale Pinnaspis buxi (Bouche) (Swezey, 1940).
In Saipan the scale was probably controlled by T. nitida, which is distributed throughout the Marianas (Esaki, 1940). Esaki indicated that there were no important problems with A. destructor after the initial outbreak around 1910. However, in 1960, Azya trinitatis Marshall and Cryptognatha nodiceps Marshall, both predators of A. destructor from Trinidad, were released. There is no record of whether they established or not. P. anomalus was also released in 1962 on Saipan and in 1964 on Rota. Although P. anomalus was recorded as established in 1963 on Saipan, the beetle had previously been collected from Saipan in 1960 (Chapin, 1965), an occurrence which emphasizes the need to do preliminary surveys before spending time and money making unnecessary releases. The beetle, however, had not been previously collected on Rota and its status on Rota at this time is unknown. In 1968, R. satelles was collected on Palau and released on Saipan. No followup on the status of this beetle has been made. Currently P. anomalus, T. nitida and C. nigritus, which was first found on Saipan in 1970, are all present and effecting control of A. destructor.

Parasaissetia coffeae and P. nigra
Two other scales which have been the targets of an intensive biological control program on Guam are Parasaissetia coffeae (Walker) and P. nigra (Nietner). Prior to 1936, a coccinellid, Azya orbigera Mulsant, was released against either these scales or P. oleae (Bernard), on which it is also known to feed (Clausen, 1978). A. orbigera established (Chapin, 1965), but its value as a control agent has never been assessed. In 1954, a series of parasites was released against P. coffeae and P. nigra (Table 1), of which at least three, Metaphycus helvolus (Compere), M. lounsburyi (Howard), and Scutellista cyanea Motsch. established (Peterson, 1957a). The status of two other parasites (Table 1) has not been determined. Although no formal study of their impact has ever been made, our observations suggest a fairly high degree of success for P. nigra, as this scale is uncommon and difficult to find. P. coffeae is more common, particularly on guava, but rarely attains levels which are damaging, suggesting at least partial success. Unfortunately no information is available on the pre-release populations of the scale or their economic impact. Formal assessment of the degree of success needs to be made.

Furcaspis oceanica
The coconut red scale Furcaspis oceanica (Lindinger), an endemic species in the Carolines and Marshalls, was discovered in Saipan in 1943 (Esaki, 1952) and proceeded to become a serious pest (Pemberton, 1954). Sometime after 1954 it appeared on Guam, and is now a serious pest in the central part of the island (Muniappan, 1987; Marutani and Muniappan, 1988). In the localities where it is abundant, the undersides of the coconut leaves and young coconut fruits are entirely covered with scales and the leaves have a distinct yellow cast. Some leaves on some heavily infested coconuts are dying from the impact of this scale.
Biological control efforts against this scale began in 1947. R. L. Doutt found a new

Micronesica 22(1), 1989.

species of wasp, Adelencyrtus oceanicus (Doutt), on Ulithi and released it on Saipan in 1948 (Pemberton, 1954). No evidence that the wasp established were noted by Bryan (1949) or Pemberton and both recommended further work. None of the records of the Department of Natural Resources or Trust Territory Records indicate further work was done, but recently Marutani and Muniappan (1988) surveyed the scales on Saipan and found that A. oceanicus had established and had reduced the coconut red scale to extremely low levels. A. oceanicus was released in 1988 to control the scale on Guam.

lcerya purchasi and/. aegyptiaca
The cottony cushion scale Icerya purchasi (Maskell) and the Egyptian fluted scale/. aegyptiaca (Douglas) were early targets of biological control in the Marianas. On Guam Rodolia cardinalis (Mulsant) was obtained from Hawaii and released in 1926. A vigorous breeding program was established, and the beetle was released at all sites where /. purchasi could be found (Vandenberg, 1929) . The beetle was highly effective, and the scale and beetle nearly vanished, leading Vandenberg to suggest that reintroduction might be necessary every few years. However, an outbreak of / . purchasi in 1929- was quickly brought under control by the beetle, lessening his fears (Vandenberg, 1931). R. cardinalis was present as late as 1945, but it has not been found since then. Neither/. purchasi nor/. aegyptiaca is currently a problem, but the predominant predator on them throughout the Marianas is R. pumila Weise not R. cardinalis. R. pumila was brought to Saipan before WWII mis-identified as a form of R. cardinalis (Esaki, 1952, Beardsley, 1955) and was probably spread to the rest of the Marianas either accidentally or by the Japanese. There are no records of its being intentionally moved within the Marianas. R. breviuscula Weise was also introduced but only 12 individuals were released (Chapin, 1965) and establishment is doubtful.

Nipaecoccus viridis
Recently the mealybug N. viridis (= N. vastator (Maskell)) was found in the Marianas. In the mid-1970s it was present in outbreak levels and was severely damaging Leucaena leucocephala (Lam .) de Hit, an important source of firewood and the basis of a charcoal industry on Saipan. On Saipan the parasite Anagyrus dactylopii (Howard) and Delphastus pusillus were introduced for biological control. The status of these natural enemies are not known at this time. On Guam, Anagyrus indicus Shaffee et a!., probably a fortuitous introduction, effectively controlled the mealybug (Nechols and Seibert, 1985).

APHIDS
At least two species have been introduced to the Marianas for the control of aphids. The coccinellids Platyomus lividigaster (Mulsant) and Orcus chalybeus (Boisduval) were introduced from Hawaii in 1953 (Pemberton, 1954). Neither species has been collected since, so we assume that these species did not establish . A third species of coccinellid may have been introduced in the early 1900s (Briggs, 1920), but there are no records mentioning which species it was. Briggs refers to it as a red lady beetle with black spots which was feeding on aphids and mealybugs. He states it was imported from Hawaii and reared by

Nafus & Schreiner: Biological Control

81

the Agricultural Station in large numbers some years previously. There are several species of lady beetle on Guam conforming to that description, all of which are probably native or recent, accidental introductions. We suspect this may not have been a new introduction and that Briggs was confusing the lady beetle he observed with the introduction of C. montrouzieri in 1911.

WHITEFLIES
Since 1950, three whiteflies have been accidentally introduced to Guam. Two of these, Aleurocanthus spiniferus (Quaintance) and Aleurodicus dispersus Russell, have been the targets of active biological control programs. A. spiniferus was successfully controlled by Amitus he~peridum Silvestri and Encarsia smithi (Silvestri). E. smithi was the more important parasite of the two (Peterson, 1955a). Several other species were introduced but failed to establish permanently (Table 1). Biological control of A. spiniferus continues to be good, and both A. hesperidum and E. smithi are still present. E. smithi was recently sent from Guam to Kosrae and Pohnpei in the Carolines.
A. dispersus, the spiraling whitefly, is a recent immigrant to Micronesia, and has become a serious pest on a wide variety of plants (Schreiner and Nafus, 1986). Two species, Encarsia ?haitiensis Dozier and Nephaspis oculatus (Blatchley), were introduced to control A. dispersus (Table 1). Both established and, on plumeria, reduced population levels of the whitefly from 50-100 whiteflies per leaf to less than 10 (Nechols, 1982). However, the whitefly is still common and there are periodic outbreaks, particularly on certain hosts such as sea grape (Coccoloba sp).

Nezara viridula and Coptosoma xanthogramma
The southern green stinkbug Nezara viridula L. occurs on Guam, but is relatively rare and difficult to find. Trissolcus basalis (Wollaston) was shipped to Guam from Fiji sometime prior to 1959 for control of N. viridula (Rao et al., 1971), but we have no information on whether it was released or not. In 1968, a Trissolcus species was imported from Hawaii as an egg parasite of the platispid Coptosoma xanthogramma (White). C. xanthogramma is a pest of beans on Guam and was probably a new introduction to Guam at that time. No preliminary surveys were done, and there is no information as to what the economic importance of C. xanthogramma was. No follow-up has been done on whether the parasite established or not. C. xanthogramma is not abundant on commercial beans at this time and is not an economic pest, although it is sometimes abundant on certain species of noncommercial beans including jicama. A Telenomus species has been recovered from N. viridula eggs. Further follow-up on the status of Trissolcus sp. and T. basalis needs to be done.

Tarophagus proserpina
Tarophagus proserpina (Kirkaldy) was first recorded on Guam in 1924. At that time it was considered to be in outbreak proportions (Swezey, 1946), but in 1936, Swezey reported that the taro planthopper was not a serious pest. He stated that the taro planthopper was uncommon in dry-land taro, and, although common on wetland taro near ditches, it

82

Micronesica 22(1), 1989.

was not particularly damaging. A dryinid parasite, Haplogonatopus vitiensis Perkins, was found attacking the taro planthopper in small numbers. It was introduced to Hawaii in 1906 from Fiji to control the sugarcane leafhopper (Swezey, 1946), but in Guam, H. vitiensis was probably native or an accidental introduction. A hyperparasite, Echthrogonatopus exitiosus Perkins, attacks H. vitiensis on Guam and may reduce its effectiveness.
In 1947, Pemberton (1954) shipped the egg predator Cyrtorhinusfulvus Knight from Hawaii to Guam. This mirid is a specific predator of the eggs of the taro planthopper and had successfully controlled the planthopper in Hawaii. C. fulvus established and has been credited with keeping planthopper populations at non-damaging levels, although the degree of control provided by C. fulvus needs formal evaluation since there is controversy about the status of the taro planthopper as a pest. Occasionally T. proserpina becomes abundant on taro, but populations seldom remain high for long intervals. C. fulvus were shipped from Guam to Pohnpei and possibly to other islands in the early 1950s (Pemberton, 1954).

Heteropsylla cubana
In 1985, the psyllid Heteropsylla cubana Crawford was first noticed attacking Leucaena leucocephala on Guam. It quickly reached damaging numbers. In certain localities stands of L. leucocephala, an important source of firewood and agricultural structural material, were killed. In other areas the growing tips of the plants were stunted, opening the canopy and allowing various vines and herbaceous species to invade. Frequently guinea grass, which is of little economic importance, replaced the leucaena. In spots where vines predominated, the vines frequently overtopped L. leucocephala, shading it out and eventually killing it. In 1986 the ladybeetle Curinus coeruleus Mulsant was obtained from Hawaii and released. About 500 beetles were shipped, but the shipment was delayed in transit and about half the beetles died before arrival. The survivors were released in lots of about 60 at four sites. At one of the sites an infestation on an unidentified mealybug on wild bittermelon was noticed. This was not observed at the other release sites. During subsequent visits during the first week the beetle was noted to be feeding on the mealybug and not on the psyllids, which were extremely abundant. One year following release, the beetle was found established only at the site where the mealybug was and not at the other three sites. Numerous larvae and adults have been found feeding on the psyllids. The effectiveness of the beetle is currently being evaluated. Preliminary results suggest the beetle is having little effect on psyllid populations.
C. coeruleus was also released in Saipan in 1986. We recovered specimens in 1988.

LEPIDOPTERA
At least nine species of Lepidoptera have been the targets of biological control programs in the Marianas.

Ostrinia furnacalis
Perhaps the most intensive program has been conducted against the Asian corn borer Ostriniafurnacalis, a serious pest of corn throughout the Marianas. Biocontrol introduc-

83

tions against the Asian corn borer were started in 1926 and have continued to the present day (Table 1). To date, only one parasite intentionally released, Trichogramma chilonis Ishii, has established and persisted. Lydella thompsoni Herting established on Guam in the early 1930s and provided excellent control of the Asian corn borer initially (Vandenberg, 1933; Swezey, 1941a), but by 1950 the tachinid had disappeared (Peterson, 1955b). Attempts to re-establish it from U.S. sources failed (Nafus and Schreiner, 1986a).
Many of the parasites introduced for the control of 0. furnacalis were from temperate zone sources or were parasites of a closely related species, 0. nubilalis. None of the introductions from these sources established. In many cases, fairly large releases or extended rearing and release efforts were made to no avail. Exeristes roborator (F.) was reared and released by the thousands in the 1920s but only a few, nonpersistant field recoveries could be made (Vandenberg, 1926, 1928, 1929, 1930, 1933). We are not certain why releases consistently failed, but there are several factors which may be important other than, or in addition to, climatic factors or an inappropriate host. Corn as a crop is seasonal, generally being planted in widely scattered areas at the end of the dry season and again at the end of the wet season. In the off-season little corn is grown. Between crops the Asian corn borer can be found on a variety of alternate hosts, although it is relatively scarce. To establish and be successful, any introduced parasites must be able to find the borer on its alternate hosts or to switch to other species of Lepidoptera. T. chilonis, Xanthopimpla punctata (F.), Brachymeria albotibilalis (Ashmead), and Tetrastichus ?inferens Yoshimoto all attack the Asian corn borer on Guam (Table 2). All of these parasitoids have fairly broad host ranges and none of them is particularly effective at controlling the Asian corn borer (Nafus and Schreiner, 1986a). X. punctata is an ichneumonid wasp which is common on Guam but only occasionally is found on the Asian corn borer. X. punctata apparently is a relative newcomer to Micronesia as it was not found in the early surveys (Townes, 1958). Tetrastichus ?inferens is also new to the Marianas and its occurrence on O.furnacalis is a new host record (Nafus and Schreiner, 1986a). In 1987 a species of Echthromorpha new to Guam was found parasitizing 0. furnacalis pupae. The parasite was more common in pupae located in the tassel, but a total of only 0.2% of the pupae were parasitized. This parasite also attacks several other species of Lepidoptera.
Another factor which may be inhibiting pupal and larval parasites is predation by ants and earwigs. In 1986 Trichomma cnaphalocrocis Uchida was collected in Taiwan andreleased in a field cage on Guam. Efforts were made to keep Solenopsis geminata (F.) and other ants out of the cage, but the ants managed to attack most of the pupae and only a single parasitized pupa survived. Pupal parasites are present in the Marianas but they are normally rare (Nafus and Schreiner, 1986a). General predation by ants may be contributing to the poor establishment record.

Plutella xylostella
The diamondback moth Plutella xylostella (L.) is a serious problem on cabbage and related crops in Northern Guam. Beginning in 1971, several attempts to import parasites were made. Four species were released, some repeatedly, but none established (Table 1). In part this may have been because the releases were made in farm fields which were subsequently treated with insecticides. The diamondback remains a serious pest of cole crops. The only parasite attacking the diamondback on Guam is Chelonus blackburni

84

Micronesica 22(1), 1989.

Cameron, which is not particularly effective. Additional biological control efforts are needed, but, before any natural enemies are imported, the wild hosts of the diamondback need to be identified. Releases could then be made on wild hosts where there are good populations of the diamondback rather than in farm fields which may be treated with insecticides. To date, the alternate hosts of the diamondback have not been identified on Guam.

Pericyma cruegeri
Another moth which has not yielded any success to biological control is the poinciana looper, Pericyma cruegeri (Butler). This moth entered Guam around 1971 and became a serious pest. P. cruegeri defoliates most of the poincianas three to five times each year, usually during the period from August to February. After February the moth is uncommon, although outbreaks can occur at other times of the year. Muniappan (1973) found a tachinid Exorista civiloides (Bar.) parasitizing about 1% of the pupae. In 1973 Muniappan introduced Brachymeria albotibilalis (Ashmead) (as B. euploeae (Westwood)) from Papua New Guinea. B. albotibilalis established but has had little effect on P. cruegeri as it parasitizes a low percentage of pupae. B. albotibilalis is a very generalized parasitoid and it attacks a wide range of other Lepidoptera including the Asian corn borer (Nafus and Schreiner, 1986a). Additional work is needed in finding new sources of natural enemies which are specialized and are more effective. A possible source may be Malaysia, where the moth occurs but is rare.

Papilio polytes
Three parasites, Apanteles papilionis Viereck, Pteromalus luzonensis Gahan and Telenomus sp., were released to control the swallowtail Papilio polytes L. This is an abundant butterfly on Guam which can often be quite damaging to certain species or varieties of citrus, particularly young plants. P. luzonensis established and provides partial control, but the butterfly is still very abundant and causes considerable damage. A. papilionis did not establish, and the status of the Telenomus sp. is unknown. The butterfly is also attacked by a Trichogramma species (Muniappan, 1982a).
In part, the abundance of P. polytes may be related to its use of Triphasia trifoliata (Burmann F.l.) P. Wilson as an alternate host. This is an extremely common plant in the limestone forest areas on Guam. The effectiveness of the parasites attacking P. polytes on this host are unknown and need to be investigated. Additional parasites for this species need to be located which can keep the butterfly at very low levels on this host plant as well as other citrus hosts.

Erionota thrax
The introduced larval parasite Apanteles erionotae Wilkinson in combination with a self-introduced egg parasite Ooencyrtus erionotae Ferriere and a local Trichogramma sp. have been partially effective at controlling the banana skipper Erionota thrax (L.). Outbreaks of the skipper can occur at the beginning of the wet season and are severe enough to reduce yield. Muniappan (1982a) provides more information about these species.

Nafus & Schreiner: Biological Control

85

Argyroploce schistaceana
The Japanese introduced Trichogramma chilonis Ishii into Saipan, Rota, and Tinian in 1935 for control of Argyroploce schistaceana (Snellen) on sugarcane. This egg parasitoid was bred in large numbers and used in inundative releases (Esaki 1952). The parasitoid is now firmly established throughout the Marianas. It attacks a wide variety of eggs of Lepidoptera including 0. furnacalis, Hypolimnas bolina (L.), H. anomala (Wallace), and Agrius convolvuli. (L.). It is probably providing good biological control of A. convolvuli (N afus and Schreiner, 1986b).

Spodoptera litura and S. mauritia
Cutworms or cluster caterpillars, Spodoptera litura (F.) and S. mauritia (Boisd.) are numerous in the Marianas and are problems on a wide variety of crops and ornamentals. S. litura is a problem on taro and a minor pest on beans, cabbage, corn, tomatoes, and other crops. In the early 1930s it was a serious problem on banana leaves as well (Swezey, 1941 b). S. mauritia is predominantly a pest of turf, both at private residences and on golf courses, at the beginning of the wet season in June or July. In 1936, Telenomus nawai Ashmead was brought from Hawaii and released to control S. litura. It established and attacked the eggs of both S. litura and S. mauritia (Swezey, 1941b). T nawai was credited with controlling S. litura on banana, and by 1938 it was no longer considered a problem on this plant (Anon., 1938).
S. litura continued to be a problem on other hosts, and additional efforts to improve biological control were made. In 1958, Lespesia archippivora (Riley) and Calosoma blaptoides tehuacanum (Lapouge) were released (Table 1), and in 1971, Telenomus remus Nixon was obtained from India. Telenomus remus established and appears to be the dominant parasite on S. mauritia at this time. Neither L. archippivora or C. blaptoides have been recovered, and it seems probable that they did not establish. Another parasite Apanteles marginiventris (Cress.), which was not purposefully introduced to Guam, has been reared from S. litura in several locations on Guam.

Penicillaria jocosatrix
Recently an effort to control the mango shoot caterpillar Penicillaria jocosatrix Guenee was initiated. This noctuid caterpillar feeds on the new leaves, flowers and green fruits of mango. It can reduce the leaf area on a tree by as much as 50% or more, and is particularly serious on non-local mango varieties. It also has been found to nearly completely strip all of the flowers from those trees which do flower and has been found eating the skin and meat of fruits up until they are nearly mature. On Guam it is a major problem on mango, although in other parts of the world it appears to be uncommon.
In 1986 and early 1987 four natural enemies were released for control of this caterpillar. These are: Trichogramma platneri Nagarkatti, Aleiodes sp. nr. circumscriptus (Nees), Euplectrus sp. nr. parvulus Ferriere, and Blepharella latera/is Macquart. T. platneri is an egg parasite which prefers Lepidoptera in the canopies of trees. It was imported from California. The other three parasites were introduced from India. A series of 18 releases of Aleiodes sp. were made over a period of about one year (1986-87). A total of

Micronesica 22(1), 1989.

453 wasps were released in Agat, Dededo, Yigo, Barrigada, Mangilao, Piti, and lnarajan. This is a larval parasite which attacks the first three instars. The development time is about 11-13 days. Aleiodes sp. established and spread out from the release sites but then disappeared about seven months after the final release. No specimens have been recovered since August, 1987.
Euplectrus sp. is a gregarious ectoparasitoid which lays its eggs primarily on the first three instars. At oviposition the wasp stings the larvae and arrests the development of the caterpillar. Development of the wasp is rapid: taking only eight to ten days to go from egg to newly emerged wasps. Pupation takes place under the collapsed larval skin of the caterpillar. Nineteen releases of Euplectrus sp. were made in seven villages during 1986 and 1987. A total of 858 wasps were released. In July 1987, Euplectrus was recovered from all release sites and parasitize up to 39% of the caterpillars.
B. lateralis was released in eight lots ranging from 3 to 11 flies each in Yigo and Dededo. A total of 45 living flies were released and many of these were in poor condition as the fly did not ship well and could not be reared in the laboratory. The tachinid fly Jays minute black eggs on the new growth. The larvae feed internally in the fifth instar caterpillars or in the pupae. Pupation often takes place in the mango shoot caterpillar pupa. In August, 1987, 15 of 225 (6. 7%) caterpillars from several villages were parasitized by the tachinid, suggesting a rapid buildup and spread of this species despite the low numbers released. Evaluation of the effectiveness and degree of success of these parasites is underway.

COLEOPTERA
Releases of parasites or predators for control of at least seven species of beetle have been made.

Adoretus sinicus
Campsomeris marginella modesto (Smith) was released in 1950 for control of Adoretus sinicus Burmeister. A. sinicus feeds on a wide variety of plants, chewing ragged holes in the leaves. It frequently damages corn and beans, although in most cases the damage is probably not sufficient to reduce yield. The beetle also feeds on several ornamental plants including roses and creates unsightly damage on the foliage. C. marginella established and has been partially successful at controlling the beetle (Pemberton, 1954), but the beetle is still very abundant and additional control measures are needed.

Anomala sulcatula
In 1940 Campsomeris annulata (F.) was released by the Japanese against Anomala sulcatula Burmeister, a pest of sugar cane in Saipan. The wasp established (Esaki, 1952) but no assessment of its impact was made, although Krombein (1949) felt it was probably very effective. The wasp was collected on Guam for the first time in 1945 (Krombein, 1949). It is not known how the wasp got to Guam. In 1946 C. manokwariensis (Cameron), which also attacks A. sulcatula, was found on Guam (Krombein, 1950). Most

likely it was introduced to Saipan from the Philippines at the same time as C. annulata as these species are very similar, and then made its way to Guam in the same way as C. annulata. Esaki (1952) suggested the 1940 shipment to Saipan probably contained both species as more than one species was identified from the original shipment. Both wasps were later collected on Guam and sent to Hawaii for control of A. sulcatula. At the present time A. sulcatula is uncommon, but the effectiveness of the wasps is unknown since sugar cane in no longer grown commercially in the Marianas.

Brontispa mariana and B. palauensis
Originally the Marianas were free of hispines which attack coconuts; however, two species have become established, Brontispa mariana Spaeth on Saipan, Tinian, and Rota and B. palauensis (Esaki and Chujo) on Guam. By 1939, B. mariana was severely damaging coconut on Saipan. Esaki (1952) stated that " ... nearly all the plantations on the island were destroyed." Biological control activities started in 1947 when W. H. Lange was sent to Malaya to search for parasites. He found two species of parasites, Tetrastichus brontispae (Ferriere) and Hispidophila brontispae (Ferriere), on another hispid, Plesispa nipae Maul, on coconut. Both species were shipped to Saipan in 1948 and released on Saipan and Rota. T. brontispae established on both islands and effected partial control, but H. brontispae did not establish. There are still periodic outbreaks of the beetle, but the damage is considerably less severe than before the introduction ofT. brontispae.
In 1973 B. palauensis appeared on Guam and became a serious problem on coconut (Muniappan, 1982a). Strains of T. brontispae were obtained from Saipan, New Caledonia, and Vanuatu and released on Guam. The parasite established and parasitized about 30% (sometimes up to 75%) of the B. palauensis larvae and pupae (Muniappan et al., 1980). Periodic outbreaks of the beetle still occur. Additional biological control work is needed.

Epilachna vigintisexpunctata
The Philippine lady beetle, Epilachna vigintisexpunctata philippinensis (Dieke), is a pest of eggplant, potato and tomato. Peterson introduced Aplomyiopsis epilachnae (Aldr.) and Pediobius foveolatus Crawford (as P. epilachnae (Rohwer)) in 1950-54 for control of the beetle. A. epilachnae, a parasite of E. varivestis Muls. from Mexico, did not establish. P. foveolatus was brought in from the Philippines where it had been collected on E. vigintisexpunctata. The wasp established and parasitized about 75% of the beetles (Peterson, 1955c). In the late 1950s the wasp was sent to Saipan and Rota. It established on both islands and exerted partial control of the beetle. However, on Saipan the beetle remained a serious pest.
In 1974 a strain of P. foveolatus was introduced to Guam from the United States. This strain originated in India, and emerged from the larva rather than the pupa as in the Philippine strain. We do not know for certain if the introduction of the second strain was successful, but we have reared parasites from both the pupa and the larva. Currently the Philippine lady beetle is only occasionally a serious pest on Guam.
On Saipan, a strain of P. foveolatus was obtained from a laboratory population in

88

Micronesica 22(1), 1989.

Delaware, U.S .A., in 1985 and released . The status of that strain is not known but we suspect the release failed as many of the release sites were unsuitable or were destroyed by construction soon after the release.

Cosmopolites sordidus
Three species of histerid beetles, Plaesius javanus Erichson, Hololepta minuta Erichson and H. quadridentata (F.), were released on Guam from 1947 to 1954 for control of the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germ.) . P. javanus established (Pemberton, 1954) but no follow-up on its effectiveness was made. The status of the other two species is unknown .

Rhabdoscelus obscurus
Rhabdoscelus obscurus (Boisduval) attacks coconut, other palms, and sugarcane. The larvae tunnel in the trunks and growing tips of palms or bore in the stalks of sugarcane. Infested palms are weakened. Entry holes caused by the beetles allow disease organisms to enter the palms. An effort to control the pest was initiated in 1926 by Vandenberg. The tachinid Lixophaga sphenophori (Viii.) was obtained from Hawaii. A few flies were released in the field and the rest were kept for a breeding program. After various trials and tribulations, Vandenberg got a healthy colony going only to discover that the fly had established in the field either from escapes or from the original release of about 20 flies . Approximately 50% of the field collected larvae of the weevil were parasitized (Vandenberg, 1930). In 1928 the fly was collected and sent to Saipan to control the weevil there. Unfortunately, the establishment was temporary on Guam and after 1929 the tachinid was no longer present (Vandenberg, 1931). It also failed to establish on Saipan (Vandenberg, 1930) .

DIPTERA
Dacus cucurbitae and D. dorsalis
Several species of parasites were introduced from Hawaii from 1937 through 1962 to control Dacus cucurbitae Coquillett and D. dorsalis Hendel. Against D . dorsalis, seven species and five subspecies of Biosteres longicaudatus were released (Table 1). Only one of these, Syntomosphyrum indicum Silvestri, established, although its continued presence is doubtful unless it can successfully use D. cucurbitae or D. ochrosiae Malloch as a host. D. dorsalis was eradicated from all of the Marianas islands in 1962, and fruit fly surveys since then have yielded no specimens. A subspecies of B. longicaudatus was collected on Guam in 1936 from D. ochrosiae (Swezey, 1946).
Three species of parasitoids were specifically released for control of D. cucurbitae (Table 1). Opiusfietcheri Silvestri was repeatedly released, first in 1937 (Anon ., 1937a) and then again in the 1950s. In 1937 both 0 . fietcheri and Opius humilis Silvestri were sent from Hawaii. Part of the shipments were released, and part was retained to rear them

89

(Anon., 1937a) . 0. fietcheri established and was reported to cause 6.1% mortality in the release fields (Anon., 1937d). In 1953, 0 . fietcheri was re-released, and additional releases were made periodically through 1967. It was recovered in 1971, but no follow-up on its parasitization rate was done. Certainly it has not provided good control of D. cucurbitae: the melon fly is extremely abundant and causes substantial economic losses of cucumbers, bittermelon, watermelon and cantaloupe.

Liriomyza trifolii
The leafminer Liriomyza trifolii Burgess is a relative newcomer to Guam, first appearing around 1978 (Schreiner and Nafus , 1986). It occurs on a wide variety of crops including watermelon, cantaloupe, cucumber, tomato, and beans (both Vigna and Phaseolus) . In the Marianas, however, it is only a serious pest on beans and occasionally on tomatoes . Several parasitoids including Gronotoma micromorpha (Perkins), Disorygma pacifica (Yoshimoto), Gronotoma sp., Hemiptarsenus semialbiclavus Girault and Chrysonotomyiaformosa (Crawford) (Yoshimoto and Ishii, 1965; Schreiner et al., 1986) attack L. trifolii on Guam, but the leafminer is still a problem on beans at certain seasons of the year even when insecticides are not used . Attempts have been made to introduce additional natural enemies. Two species have been released so far, Ganaspidium utilis Beardsley and Diglyphus begini (Ashmead). G. utilis was released in groups of 200 at several locations over a period of several months. G. utilis established and has become the dominant parasitoid on L. trifolii. D. begini was released in low numbers at a time when leafminers where being heavily parasitized by local parasites. Three releases were made. Continuous monitoring for several years after the release indicates that D. begini did not establish.

Ophiomyia phaseoli
Another pest of beans is the bean fly Ophiomyia phaseoli (Tryon). The bean fly mines in the petiole and stem, often killing seedlings and reducing the vigor of older vines. Two parasites, Opius importatus Fischer and 0. phaseoli Fischer, were released for control of the bean fly in 1971-1972. These parasites were not recovered in limited surveys in 1988. H. semialbiclavus and an unidentified wasp were the only parasites reared.

GENERAL PREDATORS
Three mantids, Polyspilota aeruginosa (Goeze), Sibylla pretiosa Still, and Spodromantis sp., were released in 1972. None of these mantids has been collected since, and we feel that they did not establish.
The drongo Dicrurus macrocercus S. Baker was released by the Japanese in Rota in 1935 for insect control (Baker, 1951). It spread to Guam in 1961, apparently on its own. It was considered a pest because of its aggressive behavior towards native birds.
The toad Bufo marinus L. was brought to Guam from Hawaii in 1937 by Oakley. Initially 19 individuals were released at Agana Springs (Anon., 1937b), and the following year an additional 41 toads were released (Anon., 1938). Progeny of these toads were

90

Micronesica 22(1), 1989.

actively spread around the island. The toad was credited with reducing populations of the garden slug Veronicella leydigi Simroth (Anon., 1938) and the banana weevil (Anon., 1937c). The slug was noted to be abundant prior to the introduction of the toad . In one field about 500 slugs were being removed with sharpened sticks each day. As the toad moved into infested areas, the slugs were vastly reduced (Swezey, 1941c). Currently slugs are extremely rare. Instead, the toad has become a nuisance (Eldredge, 1988). It is extremely abundant near human habitation and areas with standing water. Densities of 185 to 225 toads per hectare have been recorded in these areas (Chernin, 1979). It may have affected the native insect and mollusc fauna, but no impact studies have been done. Toads were found on Tinian, Saipan and Rota in 1944, apparently having been brought there during the Japanese occupation (Townes, 1946). Whether the toads were intentionally or accidentally moved, is not known .

MITES
Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot and Typhlodromus occidentalis Nesbitt were introduced to Guam to control Tetranychus cinnabarinus (Boisduval). T cinnabarinus is a common mite on Guam and attacks many plant species. It can be severely damaging at times. No follow-up on the release has been done , and we do not know if these predaceous mites established or not.

MOLLUSCS
The giant African snail Achatina fulica Bowdich appeared in the Marianas in Rota, Tinian, and Saipan between 1936 and 1938 and was first found on Guam in 1945. The African snail was a serious agricultural pest of vegetables and young fruit trees . It is also a vector of the rat lungworm and can spread several Phytophthora fungus diseases (Muniappan, 1982b). In the Marianas biological control began with the release of the predatory snail Gonaxis kibweziensis E. A. Smith on the island of Agiguan . G. kibweziensis became numerous, and A.fulica declined in abundance (Pemberton, 1954). Later G. kibweziensis was liberated on Guam along with two other predatory snails, G. quadrilateralis (Preston) and Euglandina rosea Ferussac . G. kibweziensis and E. rosea established and exerted some control on A. fulica (Muniappan, 1982b), but the snail remained a problem until the flatworm Platydemus manokwari Beauchamp (Tricladida: Rhynchodemidae) accidentally established. P. manokwari has reduced A. fulica to noneconomic levels (Muniappan , 1982b, 1983). G. quadrilateralis and E. rosea and probably G. kibweziensis were also introduced to Saipan. E. rosea and at least one of the Gonaxis species were said to have established there. P. manokwari has now been found on Saipan and Tinian as well as on Guam (Eldredge 1988) . Lamprigera (= Lamprophorus) tenebrosus (Walker) was also introduced to Guam to control A. fulica but failed to establish (Peterson, 1957b; Muniappan, 1982b).
Two sciomyzid flies, Sepedon macropus Walker and Sciomyza dorsata Zetterstadt were imported from Hawaii in 1959 and 1961 (Table 1). These predatory flies were brought into Hawaii to control the liverfluke snail Galba viridis (Quoy & Gaimard) . No

information, other than the importation record, is available as to why these flies were brought to Guam or if they were released.

WEEDS
Two species of weeds, Lantana camara L. and Chromolaena odorata (L.), have been the targets of biological control work.

Lantana camara
Efforts to control L. camara began in 1958 on Guam with the introduction of Salbia haemorrhoidalis Guenee. From 1967 through 1971, seven other species were introduced (Table 3). Of these, three established and four failed (Table 3) (Muniappan, 1988a). S. haemorrhoidalis also failed to establish (Muniappan, 1988a). Two other arthropods were found on lantana, the plume moth Lantanophaga pusillidactyla (Walker) and a mite Suidasia pontifica Oudemans associated with scorched buds. Both of these species were fortuitous introductions. L. pusillidactyla feeds on the buds and flowers and according to Muniappan (1988a) has reduced fruit set from 14-20 berries to 1-2. Ophiomyia lantanae (Froggatt) also attacks the berries. In areas where the fly was found, seed weight was reduced by 40% and between 58% and 75% of the seeds were infested (Muniappan, 1988a). In the central portions of Guam, lantana is scarce, but there are some large stands in northern Guam. Further details are given by Muniappan (1988a).
Two species, Teleonemia scrupulosa Stal and Uroplata girardi Pic, were sent to Saipan for lantana control. T. scrupulosa established. The status of U. girardi is unknown (Table 3).

Chromolaena odorata
Chromolaena odorata is an important range weed in the Marianas. On Tinian and Rota it is extremely abundant on range pastures and had eliminated most of the useful forage plants. On Guam and Saipan it is a common weed of roadsides and fields. On Guam it started to become very abundant by 1985.
Attempts to control the weed through the use of biological control agents were initiated in 1984. An arctiid moth Pareuchaetes pseudoinsulata Rego Barros was imported from Trinidad and India (the Indian population was originally from Trinidad). The moth was reared in the laboratory and released first on Guam and later in the Northern Marianas Islands. Initially, late instar larvae were released in lots of up to 800 (Seibert, 1985). These releases failed to produce establishment, in part due to predation by toads, spiders and other general predators on the caterpillars. The release techniques were modified so that a minimum of 500 adult moths were released at a site. This method resulted in establishment in all release areas. Rapid defoliation of the Chromolaena followed. Virtually all of the above ground vegetation was stripped. Shoots resprouting at ground level were also consumed, and within a year over 90% of the plants were killed. The moth spread rapidly, and by 1987 had reached almost all areas of Guam. At this time, the release has resulted in

Table 3. Natural enemies released for biological control of weeds in the Marianas. The islands Guam (G) , Rota (R), Tinian (T) , Saipan (S), and Aguijan (A) are covered. In relation to the level of control we are adopting the following definitions: (H) high- populations of the target organism are low and it is no longer considered to be a problem; (G) good- populations of the target organism are usually low but outbreaks occur regularly; (E) established-the biocontrol agent established but we have no information on its impact on the target; (N) not established; (?) nothing known.

Shipments were sent as eggs (8,300 sent, 3,020 survived shipment, 0 survived to establish colony), larvae (30 sent, 20 alive), and pupae (163 sent, 12 survived to lay eggs). A laboratory colony was established from the 32larvae and pupae which survived shipment (Seibert, 1984).
2 Shipment records of the Hawaii Department of Agriculture. The exact number released is not known, only the number shipped. A high degree of lantana control has been achieved but the contribution of individual species is not known.
4 Reports of the Trust Territory Entomologist, Micronesia 5 The identification of the weed is not certain. The species listed by Brock and Takata (1956) is not known to occur on Guam and is not found in the habitat listed. Hydrilla verticillata (L.) Royle is found in the reservoir and is a problem at this time. No Potamogeton is currently found in the reservoir, although it is possible it was eliminated by S. mossambicus. 6 Rao et a!., 1971 list this species as being controlled. There are no record of this species occurring on Guam. Rao eta!. give no citation for the record so we were unable to verify control of this species. Brock and Takata ( 1956) do not mention it in their report.

successful suppression of the weed, but the moth is still in an invasion phase, and it is too early to tell if the weed will recover when moth numbers decline. The moth has also become established in Rota, Saipan, Tinian and Aguijan (Muniappan, 1988b, Seibert, 1989).
Several other insects have been released to aid in the control of Chromolaena. To date there is no evidence that any of these established. Apion brunneonigrum B .B ., a curculionid feeding on the seed heads, was released in early 1984 at the beginning of the dry season on Guam. During the dry season the above ground growth of Chromolaena dies . Because of the poor condition of the host plants at the time of the release, the beetle was not expected to establish and no recoveries of it have been made. Low numbers of Mescinia nr. parvula Zeller, a small moth which bores in the stem tips , were released in late 1984 and again in late 1986 and early 1987. At the same time, a stem-boring agromyzid fly, Melanagromyza eupatoriella Spencer was also released. Although it is still too early to assess establishment, we doubt these species will establish because the stands were defoliated by P. pseudoinsulata soon after the releases took place. The defoliation was unexpected since the moth was not present in the area or nearby at the time the site was selected (T. Seibert, personal communication).

AQUATIC WEEDS
An aquatic weed Potamogeton sp. was considered to be a potentially serious pest in the water reservoir of Fena Lake in southern Guam. The fish Oreochromis mossambicus (Peters) was released in the lake to control this weed (Brock and Takata, 1956). According to them, within a year the weed was under very good control. The species of Potamogeton is in dispute. The two species currently found on Guam seem to be found only in flowing water and never in reservoirs. Perhaps the fish have successfully eliminated them from the standing water environment. Rao eta!. (1971) state that 0. mossambicus also controlled Utruilana sp. However this weed is not mentioned in Brock and Takata (1956), and there is no reference in Rao et al. (1971) for the source of their information. The species of Utruilana currently found on Guam is not found in standing water such as reservoirs. Tilapia zilli Gervaise is found in the reservoir and may have been introduced in the late 1950s. 0. mossambicus is primarily a detritivore and it does not seem likely that it would have successfully controlled a macrophytic plant, unless the males uprooted them while making their nests. T. zilli is known to feed on macrophytes , but was not yet present in the reservoir at the time when the Potamogeton was said to have been controlled by fish . The shallow parts of the reservoir are currently choked with Hydrilla verticillata (L.) Royle, and the fish do not control this species (Leith et a!., 1984).

HOUSEHOLD, VETERINARY, AND MEDICAL PESTS
Most of the biological control introductions in this category have been directed towards mosquitoes and filth flies. One natural enemy of cockroaches, Ampulex compressa (F), a parasite of the American cockroach, was released but failed to establish. At least two other species of cockroach parasite are present on Guam, but do not parasitize enough cockroaches to keep them from being a problem.
For mosquito control, two predatory mosquitoes, a nematode, and a fish have been released (Table 4). The predatory mosquitoes failed to establish and there has been no

The years 1911 to 1988 are covered for the islands Guam (G), Tinian (T), Pagan (P) and Saipan (S). In relation to the level of control we are adopting the following definitions: (P) partial- populations of the target pest are lower but it is still a significant pest; (U) unsuccessful-the biocontrol agent established but had little or no effect on the target organism; (E) establishedthe biocontrol agent established but we have no information on its impact on the target; (T) temporary- the biocontrol agent established initially but later disappeared; (N) not established; (?) nothing known.

Shipment records of the Hawaii Department of Agriculture. The exact number released is not known, only the number shipped. 2 S. cameroni and S. endius were mixed in culture. The exact proportion received and released is not known. Both were reared in culture as well as direct field released. In 1928 , 788 were reared in culture and released. Breeding continued but no data for the numbers released is given in 1929. In 1930- 32,26,500 were released from the breeding program.

follow-up on the status of the nematode. The mosquitofish Gambusia affinis (Baird & Girard) has established in many of the springs and swamps in the Marianas (Maciolek, 1984). Its impact has never been evaluated.
To control various species of flies including Haematobia irritans L., Stomoxys calcitrans L., Musca domestica L., and M. sorbens Wd., two species of Spalangia and two dung beetles have been released (Table 4). Spalangia cameroni Perkins and S. endius Walker were sent in a mixed species culture to Guam from Hawaii in 1928 (Bryan, 1949). Some parasites were released and a few kept for rearing. Both species established and became abundant (Vandenberg, 1933), but, by 1936, S. cameroni had become scarce (Swezey, 1941d). S. calcitrans and M. domestica are uncommon, but whether this is due to parasitization or other factors is not known. H. irritans and M. sorbens are abundant in certain localities, but no evaluations on the effect of the parasites on their populations has been made. There have been changes in agricultural and sanitary practices since 1928 which could have substantially affected the populations of all of these flies. Guam has become less agrarian and more urban. Fewer livestock are reared and modern urban health practices are used. Study of the impact of Spalangia is needed before the degree of success can be assessed.
The dung beetles Copris incertus prociduus (Say) and Onthophagus incensus Say were released in 1953 (Peterson, 1957a). C. incertus estabished initially, but no recent collections have been made. No collections of 0. incensus have been made, indicating that it did not establish.

RECENT FORTUITOUS INTRODUCTIONS
In the early 1970s three species of potter wasps, Delta circinalis (F.), D. pyriforme (F.) (Schreiner and Nafus, 1986), and D. campaniformis esuriens Saussure established on Guam. These wasps prey on a wide variety of caterpillars and probably aid in the control of several species. They are extremely abundant and at times are nuisances because they built mud nests on house walls or other places which annoy homeowners. Another general predator accidentally introduced before 1972 is the praying mantis Hierodula patellifera (Serville), which has become extremely abundant, and is frequently observed feeding on a variety of economically injurious insects.
An important introduction was an Eretmocerus sp., which apparently came with its host, the woolly whitefly Aleurothrixus fioccosus (Maskell). This whitefly was first noticed in 1984 on citrus and guava (Schreiner and Nafus, 1986). In late 1984 extensive sooty mold deposits and high numbers of woolly whiteflies were present. The first counts done in March of 1985 had mean populations of over 140 woolly whiteflies per ten leaves. Recently populations have declined to very low levels and the woolly whitefly has become scarce. Parasitization rates by Eretmocerus have consistently been about 60%. The woolly whitefly is considered to be under good control now and is not an economic problem.
Another significant introduction to Guam is the coccinellid Menochiles sexmaculatus (F.). Prior to 1965, in Micronesia this lady beetle was only known from Palau. Since that time, it has appeared in Guam and in the Northern Marianas and is one of the most common predators observed on aphids. Although no formal assessment of its value has been made, its abundance suggests it is an important component of the natural enemy complex

on Guam. Another lady beetle preying on aphids which is present on Guam is Olla v-nigrum (Mulsant) (=abdomina/is (Say)). 0. v-nigrum may have been introduced through commerce (Chapin, 1965). It is not an abundant or conspicuous beetle and is much less important than M. sexmaculatus in controlling aphids. Recently it has been found to have become abundant on leucaena infested with H. cubana, and is probably feeding on this insect.

Discussion
The Marianas have been the focus of considerable work in biological control. In all, 103 species of insects as well as two predatory mites, three snails, one nematode and four vertebrates have been intentionally introduced to Guam for the purposes of controlling 41 pest species. Of the insect species, 34 established, 48 did not establish, five temporarily established, one was already present before the release and the status of the rest (25 cases) is not known. In the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, 28 species of insects have been released. Of these, 11 species established, 11 failed to establish, one was already present prior to release and the fate of seven is unknown. In addition to the insects, three species of snails and several vertebrates were introduced to control various pests.
Most of the biological control work done in the Marianas has not involved a critical study of how great a degree of control was obtained by the biocontrol agents. Pre/post release surveys, cage checks, insecticide checks or other evaluation assessment methods have rarely been done, so it is difficult to assess how much pest populations have been reduced or how much each biological control agent has contributed. In many cases no follow-up has been done at all, even to the extent of checking to see if the species established. This is a serious weakness in the biological control efforts in the Marianas and probably throughout many of the islands in the Pacific. In part, this is due to a shortage of manpower in relation to the number of new pests which establish each year and an emphasis on a quick solution to new problems. Once a problem is reduced in severity, pressure is placed on the entomologist to move on to new problems, and there is little support for documentation of the degree of success or for which natural enemy was responsible for control.
Judging from published literature where available, or from the current abundance of the pest where we have no better information, a high degree of control was obtained against five crop pests and two weeds on Guam and two crop pests on Saipan (see Tables 1 & 3 for species and definition of control). Four other exotic crop pests are under a high degree of control by fortuitously introduced or native parasites and predators (Table 2). A good degree of control for most of the year, with some outbreaks, was obtained in the case of five pests on Guam, three on Saipan, and one on Rota (Tables 1 & 2). Partial control was obtained against eight pests on Guam and one in Saipan (Tables 1, 3 & 4). For many species no information is available. Better follow-up is needed on almost all of the species introduced.
On Guam, the rate of establishment was highest for natural enemies introduced to control Homoptera and Coleoptera (Table 5). Against Homoptera, for those cases for which the outcome is known, 58% of the parasites and predators established permanently. Against Coleoptera, only nine natural enemies were released and four of these estab-

lished. The success rate against Lepidoptera (35%) and Diptera (20%) was lower. In part, the poor success rate for these orders was due to a failed effort to control the Asian corn borer and the oriental fruitfly. Although numerous species of biocontrol agents were released to control these two species, only one established (Table 1). The success rate was somewhat lower than the success rate against the same orders in Hawaii, but considerably higher than for the continental United States or for California alone (Ehler and Andres, 1983). Presumably the rate of successful introductions was lower than for Hawaii because the introductions were performed with much less effort at evaluation and rearing than is the case for biocontrol agents released in Hawaii. On the other hand, despite the lack of effort, the success rate was high in comparison to continental areas , suggesting, as some have argued, that it may be easier to establish biological control agents on islands.
One of the goals of biological control workers is to understand why some species successfully establish and perform well while other species fail to establish or to exert any meaningful control over their host populations . Knowledge of all the important factors would allow biocontrol workers to better predict which natural enemies would be more likely to be useful and which would not. Unfortunately, no consistent predictors are yet known, although a number of variables which seem to be important have been suggested. Among these variables are genetic diversity, climatic suitability, correctness of host species or biotype and characteristics of the natural enemy. We would like to discuss some of these concepts with respect to the success rates introducing natural enemies to Guam. Our analysis will concentrate on the natural enemies of crop pests since this is a large group and encompasses the majority of the introductions to Guam (76 species). In some cases, we did not have information on all components of the analysis (such as the number released or the origin of the insect): thus, the numbers discussed in each section will not always total 76 species.
The number of organisms needed for release to get establishment is an important variable to know in any biological control program. On one hand, it is expensive and time-consuming to rear or collect natural enemies, but, on the other hand, importing and releasing too few may result in failure of a potentially good natural enemy to establish . Failure could result from too low numbers to overcome natural levels of mortality, to find mates, or from problems associated with low genetic diversity. Potentially, poor genetic

diversity could cause the release to fail even after temporary establishment. This could happen if the organism did not have enough adaptability to respond to environmental conditions, to differences in the host, or if inbreeding problems or genetic bottlenecks develop.
We examined the effect of the number of organisms released on whether the introduced natural enemy established permanently or not. If fewer than 100 individuals were released, 18% of the releases established (Table 6). With a higher release rate, a better success rate was apparent, although the success rate did not continue to increase linearly. The release of moderate numbers of organisms, between 100 and 1000, produced as good an establishment rate as releases of large numbers. Release of very few individuals does occasionally result in success and is worth trying if larger numbers are not available. For example, in Egypt Rodolia cardinalis established from a release of six individuals (Clausen, 1978).
Matching similar climates is considered to be extremely important in determining whether natural enemies will establish or not. Most biocontrol cases where climatic matching has been a significant factor were in temperate latitudes or in desert climates where extremes of climate such as lethal temperatures or humidity or very seasonal weather were important. We were unable to precisely identify the climatic conditions from where our natural enemies originated as in most cases only the country was given at best. We attempted to examine the issue to some extent by checking to see if beneficials from tropical zones established better than ones imported from other latitudes. This is a very gross comparison, since even within a country in a tropical zone there can be dramatic differences in microclimates which could be highly important. Still some differences were apparent (Table 7). Releases of beneficials imported from temperate latitudes failed to establish permanently in 11 of 12 cases (92%) while releases of beneficials originating from tropical or subtropical latitudes succeeded about 50% of the time.
Another important consideration in biological control is which host to get your natural enemy from and how wide its host range should be. Should the natural enemy come from the same host, or can it come from a closely related host? Is it better to import natural enemies with wide host ranges, or should they be specialized? In terms of establishment rate, the generalized predators (including a carabid, several coccinellids, two tachi-

nids, and two trichogrammatids) and the specialists from the same host established at approximately the same rate (Table 8). Specialists taken from one host and released against another, established at a distinctly lower rate. Only three of 12 releases resulted in permanent establishment. One of these was Tetrastichus brontispae on Brontispa palauensis (and on B. mariana in Saipan). T. brontispae was collected in southeast Asia from several locations and from several hosts. In Malaysia it was collected from Plesispa nipae Maulik and P. reichei Chapuis and in Java from Brontispa longissima javana Weise and B. longissima celebensis Gestro. It was then introduced to Saipan against B. mariana and later to Guam for control of B. palauensis. Both Brontispa species are endemic to Micronesia butT. brontispae is not. B. mariana occurs on the islands and atolls in the region of Yap and Truk and B. palauensis was originally found only in Palau. T. brontispae established on both species and provided fairly good control although there are still some seasonal outbreaks. T. brontispae is somewhat generalized in that it attacks several species of hispines within the same subfamily and within the genus Brontispa. It, however, had not been exposed to the Micronesian species before, but was able to switch and actually may have provided better control of them than of the original hosts. Parasitization rates up to

101

77% in larvae and 89% in pupae were found in B. mariana by Doutt (1950). In B. palauensis lower parasitization rates were recorded, generally around 30% but up to 75% (Muniappan eta!., 1980), but this is still substantially higher than in the native host where parasitization rates were around 16% (Lange, 1953) . Both of these new hosts may have lacked defensive abilities. Certain strains of B. longissima are known to be able to kill T. brontispae through phagocytic encapsulation and melanization (Tjoa, 1965).
The other two successful introductions originating from different hosts were two parasites, Encarsia smithi and Amitus hesperidum, taken from Aleurocanthus woglumi Ashby in Mexico and successfully used against A. spiniferus. However, these may not constitute a switch of hosts. The geographical range of A. spiniferus and A. woglumi overlap, both originally being southeast Asian species, and both parasites have been taken from A. spiniferus within its native range (Clausen, 1978). It is unclear which whitefly host E. smithi originated from as shipments of this parasitoid to Mexico came from both Malaya where both hosts occur and the Pakistan area where A. spiniferus does not occur. The most likely original of host of A. hesperidum was A. woglumi as the parasitoid was collected in Pakistan (Clausen, 1978). This suggests that the specific strain of A. hesperidum used probably had not been exposed to A. spiniferus before. E. smithi is the more common parasitoid on Guam.
Of the five generalists which are known to have established, one was rated as providing partial control, another was considered unsuccessful and the rest could not be rated for effectiveness. Among the 18 specialists rated, seven provided a high degree of control, seven a good level, two partial control and two were unsatisfactory.
We also examined the establishment rate of biocontrol agents that were collected in their native environment and released, with the establishment rate of biocontrol agents successfully introduced to a new location, and then transferred to the Marianas. Of the natural enemies brought directly from their native home to the Marianas, 28% established compared to 56% for those species already proven successful at another site (Table 9). Thus, there was a higher establishment rate for natural enemies originating from populations which had already successfully made the transition to a new location.
Among the families of insects introduced for biological control (Table 10), the ones

with the highest establishment rates were Eulophidae (60%), Encyrtidae (75%) and Coccinellidae (60%). The lowest establishment rate was in the Ichneumonidae (0%), Braconidae (17%), Aphelinidae (38%) and Tachinidae (20%).
Based on the success and failure experienced on Guam in introducing biological control agents, we suggest the following guidelines for importing biological control agents to Pacific Islands in tropical areas. The host from which the natural enemy is collected should be the same as the target host, and the collection should be from tropical or subtropical sources rather than temperate areas. Sufficient material should be sent or collected so that between 200 and 1,000 specimens are available for release. If possible, agents which have been used successfully elsewhere, should be imported from the area where they were used. Although species with broad and narrow host ranges establish about equally well, species which are more specialized will probably produce a higher degree of control and should be preferred over those with a wide host range. Species with very broad host preferences should be avoided as they may cause problems by attacking nontarget species. As a first choice, parasites and predators from the families of Coccinellidae, Encyrtidae, and Eulophidae are recommended.
