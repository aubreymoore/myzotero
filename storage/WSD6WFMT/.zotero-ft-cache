Research in Support of the Guam Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle Eradication Project
Solar Powered Ultraviolet Light Emitting Diode for CRB Pheromone Traps
CRB Technical Report Series No. 29
Prepared by Aubrey Moore University of Guam Cooperative Extension Service November 6, 2013∗
Background
In laboratory experiments performed by colleagues in Hawaii it was discovered that adult coconut rhinoceros beetles (CRB) are attracted to ultraviolet light emmitting diodes (UVLEDs) (Matt Siderhurst, USDA-ARS-PBARC, personal communication). The PBARC team designed and assembled prototype UVLED units to be attached to standard CRB pheromone traps. Two derivatives of these prototypes were tested in a ﬁeld trial on Guam:
Type 1: The original prototype, manufactured by collaborators at USDA-ARS-PBARC, used a battery pack of eight AA alkaline batteries to power 4 UVLEDs. We added a 1 k ohm resistor to reduce current from 5.8 to 1.0 ma.with no apparent reduction in brightness. Thus the increasing battery life by at least 5 times..
Type 2: We converted solar powered lawn path lights by replacing the standard white LED with a single UVLED which had been sanded to make it diﬀuse and omnidirectional.
Traps equipped with a pheromone lure (oryctalure, ChemTica) and UVLEDs had a signiﬁcantly higher trap rate than those without UVLEDs: 0.091 versus 0.033 beetles per trap-day, respectively

(p = 0.008; t-test). Thus pheromone trap catch increased more than 3 times by addition of the UVLEDs.
It is interesting to note that traps equipped with UVLEDs, but no pheromone, caught only 0.004 beetles per trap-day, indicating that the UVLED is not acting as a typical insect light trap, but is acting synergistically with the pheromone.
Speciﬁcations
Our solar powered UVLED devices are not currently commercially available. However, they are very easy to make: just a matter of replacing LEDs with ultraviolet LEDs in solar lawn pathway lamps (Figures 1-6).
I am able to manufacture solar UVLEDs through my consulting company (Moore Scientiﬁc, PO Box 5345, UOG Station, Mangilao, Guam 96923, USA) at a price of $9.99 each.
Ultraviolet Light Emmitting Diodes
Ultraviolet light emmitting diodes were purchased from www.suntekstore.com. This company provided the following speciﬁcations:
This LED is super bright. It is suitable for color displays, indicators, diagnostic / analytical equipment and etc.
