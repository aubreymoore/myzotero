Background

On June 8, 2017, Phoebe Wall was contacted by Ilene Quitugua, Guam Visitor Bureau, and Landscape Management Systems (LMS) to investigate dieback of Scaevola taccada (nanasu in Chamorro; naupaka in Hawaiian). S. taccada is a native shrub on Guam and many tropical Pacific Islands. It is a major component of the beach strand ecosystem and it also grows on karst coastlines. Nanasu has been grown as a hardy, low maintenance ornamental hedge plant throughout Tumon Bay for at least twenty years.

Plant samples were collected to determine if the dieback is a result of insect attack. A species of bark beetle (subfamily Scolytinae) and several species of termites were extracted from the original samples. It was originally thought that the termites were the probable cause of the dieback, but it is now thought that the the bark beetles (plus possible fungal symbionts) are the primary pest with the termites moving in as the plants die.

On June 12, 2017 Wall and Moore collected a second batch of samples with the assistance of Denson from LMS. Many bark beetles, apparently from a single species, were collected from these samples. Insect specimens were preserved and photographed and are currently awaiting identification by specialist taxonomists. Species determination of the insects will facilitate recommendation of control actions.
Damage Symptoms
Description

Plants suddenly wilt and die.

Bark Beetle
Description

Numerous minute bark beetles were extracted from dead and dying branches. All appear to be from a single species. This beetle is small, 1.2 mm body length, and it has a mass of golden colored hair on its face.
Identification

An iNaturalist observation was posted at: https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/6632409 . Specimens sent to Dr. Jiri Hulcr, University of Florida, on June 15, 2017.

Based solely on images, Dr. Hulcr suggests that the beetle may be a species of Pityophthorus :

    Email from Jiri Hulcr to Aubrey Moore, June 18, 2017:

    It does indeed look like a Pityophthorus of some sort. Which is interesting: that is a nightmare of a genus, composed of dozens of species which are difficult to identify. Species outside of the continental US and Europe may not be identifiable at all, but I will postpone that judgement until after I have a chance to see the individuals that you sent.

    Nearly all Pityophthorus are harmless little things. There is one species in California that attacks live twigs of pines, and then there is the big one: Pityophthorus juglandis , a recently emerged major pest of walnuts. Besides these two, no Pityophthorus is known as a pest of healthy plants.

    Do you know more about the health status of the attacked bushes? Any external or preexisting condition? Drought or flooding, excessive irrigation, too much salt, or pesticide runoff?

Vegetation of the Tropical Pacific Islands. “A major shift can be seen on maps among the Scaevola scrub, which in 1961 formed a continuous belt on the west side of Laysan. By 1984 it had declined by dieback into narrow, discontinuous strips along the west coast, while the Scavola patches became enlarges in the northeastern part of the island.It appears to be a stand-level process in population dynamics of Scavola that is regulated by external as well as internal (age-related) stresses.”

Termites
Description

At least three termite species were collected from dead nanasu twigs. In addition to the common Coptotermes and Nasutitermes is a very small species (alate body length 4.4 mm).
