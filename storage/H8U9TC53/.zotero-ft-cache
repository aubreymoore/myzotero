1 Notes
• Date and Time: Performed on May 8, 2012. • Lighting: Performed in shaded outdoor hallway. • Olfactometer: Sides of glass Y masked with blue tape. • Insects: Origin of beetles unknown. • Stimulus in right hand branch of olfactometer for ﬁrst half of expt. • In each trial, beetles were run through thrice (beetle 1 = beetle 6 = beetle
11). • Dose presented was 2 microlitres.
2 Results
• Beetles responded (made a decision within 10 s) in 15 of 30 trials. (Response rate = 50 %)

• In 9 of the 15 responses, the beetle went towards the stimulus. (Not signiﬁcant; P-value = 0.6072; Two-tailed binomial test)
• In 6 of the 15 responses, the beetle went to the left. (Not signiﬁcant; P-value = 0.6072; Two-tailed binomial test)

1 Notes
• Date and Time: Performed on May 19, 2012 at 8PM. • Lighting: Performed in shaded outdoor hallway. • Olfactometer: Sides of glass Y masked with blue tape. • Insects: Naive beetles from PIF, received May 18. • Stimulus only in right hand branch of olfactometer in ﬁrst half of expt. • In each trial, female beetles were run through twice (beetle 1 = beetle 6). • 6 microliters of Oryctalure presented on small triangle of ﬁlter paper
pinned to vial cap.
2 Results
• Beetles responded (made a decision within 10 s) in 10 of 10 trials. (Response rate = 100 %)
1

• In 6 of the 10 responses, the beetle went towards the stimulus. (Not signiﬁcant; P-value = 0.7539; Two-tailed binomial test)
• In 5 of the 10 responses, the beetle went to the left. (Not signiﬁcant; P-value = 1; Two-tailed binomial test)
