The government of Guam has developed an emergency response plan for the greater banded hornet — a large, aggressive, stinging invasive species that has been found in several locations islandwide.

The plan to combat the hornet will be explained Thursday morning, during a meeting at the University of Guam that will include representatives from the Guam Invasive Species Council and the Department of Agriculture.

Entomologists Aubrey Moore and Ross Miller will lead the 9 a.m. presentation at the Agriculture and Life Sciences Building, which will be followed by a group discussion.

“The latest invasive species has potential human health and environmental impacts that must be addressed in a timely manner,” Agriculture Director Matthew Sablan said in a written statement. “Each agency’s input and expertise is vital to this meeting.”

Hornets from a nest in Tamuning last month stung Guam firefighters who attempted to rescue a dog trapped in a ravine.

PACIFIC DAILY NEWS

23 species threatened

The university in early August announced the presence of the new species, which had been identified by entomologists at the university’s College of Natural and Applied Sciences.

Colonies discovered in Upper Tumon and Yona had been destroyed, the university reported, noting that the hornet may already be established here. Residents in the two villages with colonies reported being stung, according to the university, which stated the sting from this large species is very painful.

It has been asking residents to call 735-2068 or 735-2100 to report any sightings of the hornets, which are slightly larger than the diameter of a quarter, with a distinct bright yellow band around the abdomen.

According to the university, the species, known as vespa tropica, is found in China, Japan, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, India and the Philippines.

They raid the nests of other wasp species to take larvae back to their own nest to feed their larvae.
