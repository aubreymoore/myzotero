A non-native butterfly has recently been seen on Guam, but it's too early to tell if it could be a new invasive species.

A public Facebook post from Jan. 17 on the Guam Department of Agriculture Biosecurity Division page states the Gulf fritillary butterfly, or Agraulis vanillae, has been spotted around the island.

The butterfly has yellow and orange tones with some white spots, several strong black lines and dark features.

The caterpillar has brown and orange tones with plenty of protruding black spikes, and feeds primarily on non-native green vines around the island.

The division stated the butterfly is native to the southwest U.S., Mexico and Central America, but has recently been discovered in California, Hawaii and now Guam.

The division did not include details on how the butterfly or caterpillar may have made its way to Guam or where it has been spotted.

Island residents are asked to help determine the spread of the non-native butterfly if spotted by calling the division at 475-PEST (7378) or messaging their Facebook page. Reports should include photos and the location of the sighting.
