The coconut rhinoceros beetle — an invasive species that bores into and ultimately kills coconut trees — has started to invade bags of prepackaged gardening soil in Guam as well, according to the University of Guam.

The university now is encouraging residents to store bags of soil indoors in order to prevent the further spread of the beetle.

One of the most effective defenses against the beetle has been the use of fishing nets to cover trees and compost piles. The beetles get their bodies stuck in the netting and eventually die. But that method ultimately will not stop an islandwide population growth, researchers have concluded, because most of the breeding sites are inaccessible.

Attempts to kill the beetle using a virus that has worked on similar beetles have been ineffective because Guam’s beetles are genetically unique , according to researchers, who are searching for a different virus to combat this specific type of beetle.

Beetle hits weavers hard

The beetles first were detected in Tumon in September 2007, and efforts to trap them failed. They spread islandwide by 2010.

According to the university, employees at the College of Natural and Applied Sciences Extension and Outreach received many complaints from residents who found beetle grubs in bags of potting soil purchased at stores on island.

“These complaints prompted us to investigate by visiting the garden center of a local hardware store that imports soil from the U.S. mainland,” said Aubrey Moore, UOG extension entomologist. “We noticed several unopened bags of potting soil with multiple holes in the plastic. After selecting one and opening it we discovered five large coconut rhinoceros beetle grubs. Unfortunately for Guam’s coconut trees, this is a really good way to spread rhino beetles around the island.”

According to the university, beetles look for high-density organic material, such as potting soil, to find a mate and lay their eggs. The beetles have been making holes in the thin plastic bags of potting soil to deposit their eggs.
