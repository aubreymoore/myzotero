Have you seen this bug!? Say hello to our recently discovered non-native butterfly. This is the Gulf Fritillary Butterfly or Agraulis vanilla. It’s native range is southwest US, Mexico and Central America but has moved into California, Hawaii and now Guam. The catepillars feed primarily on the non-native vine Passiflora foetida. To help determine the level of spread through the island, give us a call at 475-PEST(7378) or DM us if you have seen this butterfly. Please provide visual confirmation and location/GPS coordinates. # guam # biosecurity # invasivespecies # butterfly # caterpillar # pest

    Dan Lindstrom Although I am totally against any introduction, the premature use of the terms “Invasive Species” and “Pest” are not yet warranted with this one yet and represents an overreaction. Perhaps a benign, and understandable overreaction but may divert attention/resources from more serious threats. Just saying 🙏🏽
