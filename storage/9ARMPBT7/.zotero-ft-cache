Guam won't lose its coconut trees to the invasive coconut rhinoceros beetle, said Roland Quitugua, a University of Guam extension agent who has been fighting the insect for years.

The beetle first was discovered on Guam in 2007, in Tumon Bay. It has since spread islandwide. Adult beetles kill palms when they bore into the crowns to feed on sap.

“People ask me how many trees we lost, and I can’t tell you that,” Quitugua said, adding some residents reported losing all of their coconut trees and therefore believe Guam is losing the beetle battle. “But my job is to take a couple of steps back and look at the island in its totality. I can tell you now the coconut trees are coming back. I can take you around the island and I can show you beautiful coconut trees.”

He said typhoons generate green waste, which causes a temporary spike in the beetle population because there are more breeding sites for the beetles.

“If we manage the green waste, you can then manage the population of the rhino beetle. Now we’re in a lull. It’s just going to keep going up and down."

Quitugua said the university is working on a virus, harmful to the coconut rhinoceros beetle, that has the potential to reduce beetle damage by as much as 90 percent.

“We have a fungus out there. It’s a biocontrol that can bring down some of the (beetle) population, but it’s not as effective,” he said.

“People tend to cut (the tree) down when they see the signs of rhino beetle,” said Merizo tuba farmer Daniel “Sonny” Quinata, who owns more than 200 coconut trees. “But I’ve noticed you don’t need to because sometimes the trees recover from it.”

He said he managed to collect tuba from a tree that had only a few healthy leaves left.

“I said let me try. Maybe if I take out the juice the rhino beetle will leave because it’s not sweet anymore. I don’t know, so I tried it. The tree recovered,” he said. "I tuba-ed it."

Quinata learned how to collect tuba from coconut trees in the 1970s, when he was about 11 years old and his grandfather needed help with his trees in Merizo.

The coconut sap, when freshly collected, is sweet and delicious — a refreshing drink when chilled. It eventually ferments into a sweet alcoholic beverage if left in the refrigerator for several days.

Unrefrigerated, containers of tuba eventually will turn to prized vinegar after several months. Quinata has batches of vinegar more than two years old that he sells to local restaurants.

Filipino farmers introduced tuba-making to Guam. Tuba also is a key ingredient in making rice cakes called potu.

Quinata said he didn’t collect tuba for much of his life because he was busy with his work. He was a police officer in the Guam Police Department’s homicide division.

Now retired, Quinata, 52, has a new-found appreciation for coconut trees, in large part because they provide cash to supplement his income. His trees grow on several small, connected lots in his home village of Merizo, within walking distance from his house.

“The beetles damage them, but are not killing any yet,” Quinata said. “I actually never see the beetles in the tree, but I see the signs,” including leaves falling down. “That’s how I know they’re there.”

The trees yield about seven gallons of tuba per day, which Quinata freezes in two-liter plastic bottles and sells from a deep freezer in his home and sometimes from the side of Marine Corps Drive, in Dededo. The bottles sell for $20.
Collecting from the trees

“There’s actually a lot of people (making tuba), but they’re lacking trees, and they’re not replanting. You have to (replant) because the tree will eventually get too tall,” Quinata said.

His coconut trees for collecting tuba are short, and their canopies are accessible by standing a few steps up a small ladder. He needs to make fresh cuts daily in each treetop to keep the sap flowing from the pengka, which is the fruit bud. A tree can have several pengka, which appear seasonally, Quinata said.

Quinata said trees that become too tall for collecting tuba are instead used to grow young coconuts for sale. If trees start to grow too close to utility lines or buildings, he cuts them down.

Quinata buys as much as 45 gallons of bottled water each week in order to reuse the two-liter bottles to package his tuba. The water is poured out and given to family members. Some of Quinata’s tuba also is sold in reused 2-liter Mountain Dew bottles.

Once sold, the bottles of tuba could get passed on to anyone, so Quinata writes his phone number in black magic marker on each bottle so consumers who like it know where to get more.
