Summary assembly statistics before and after Pilon improvement.
Simplified overview of the Pilon workflow for assembly improvement and variant detection. The left column depicts the conceptual steps of the Pilon process, and the center and right columns describe what Pilon does at each step while in assembly improvement and variant detection modes, respectively. During the first step (top row), Pilon scans the read alignments for evidence where the sequencing data disagree with the input genome and makes corrections to small errors and detects small variants. During the second step (second row), Pilon looks for coverage and alignment discrepancies to identify potential mis-assemblies and larger variants. Finally (bottom row), Pilon uses reads and mate pairs which are anchored to the flanks of discrepant regions and gaps in the input genome to reassemble the area, attempting to fill in the true sequence including large insertions. The resulting output is an improved assembly and/or a VCF file of variants. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0112963.g001 
Example Pilon generated genome browser tracks. This region was flagged by Pilon as containing a possible local mis-assembly, but Pilon was unable to determine a fix due to a tandem repeat sequence. The tracks shown here include: Pilon Features track indicating the extent of the region flagged by Pilon as containing a potential mis-assembly, Valid Coverage track indicating the sequence coverage of valid read pair alignments excluding the clipped portions of the alignments, Clipped Alignments track indicating the number of reads soft-clipped at each location, Pct Bad Alignments track indicating the percentage of the total reads aligned to each location which are not part of Valid Coverage . These tracks are created with the ‘—tracks’ command-line option. Together, these tracks reveal the true bounds of the mis-assembly, and indicate that there are likely missing copies of the tandem repeat in the draft assembly. In this case, manual analysis revealed the draft assembly was missing two of three full copies of a 57-base tandem repeat. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0112963.g002

These strategies are described in the Data Set Encoding section of Materials and Methods and in [5], [6]. Numbers of species representing terminal taxa are in parentheses. Bootstrap percentages (BP) are on internal branches (20AA, 21AA, codon, degen1, degen8, and noLRall1nt2; see figure key for order). Six nodes with a major increase in their bootstrap support from 20AA JTT to 21AA JTT are identified with filled circles. A more complete listing of results can be found in Table S1.
Individual codon rates are summarized through averaging for each respective amino acid (synonymous) or change between amino acids (synonymous SER (S/Z), nonsynonymous).
Bootstrap percentages >50% are displayed and indicate the strength of the compositional signal at particular nodes. The sum of all branch lengths reflects the total amount of compositional heterogeneity in the data set.

Screening for tolerance to an AT-rich template using conventional PCR amplification. Top panel: PCR amplification of a 540 bp locus (Pf3D7_11:1294982-1295521) with a relatively balanced (70% AT) base composition (positive control) in the presence or absence of TMAC. Bottom panel: PCR amplification of a 1217 bp locus (Pf3D7_01:55900-57116) with extreme AT content (84%) in the presence or absence of TMAC. M, 100 bp DNA ladder (NEB); (1) PWO master; (2) PWO master + TMAC; (3) PfuULTRA; (4) PfuULTRA + TMAC; (5) Kapa HiFi; (6) Kapa HiFi + TMAC; (7) AccuPrime Taq HiFi; (8) AccuPrime Taq HiFi + TMAC; (9) AccuPrime pfx SuperMix; (10) Phusion; (11) Phusion +TMAC; (12) Platinum HiFi; (13) Platinum HiFi + TMAC; (14) Platinum pfx; (15) Platinum pfx + TMAC, (16) Ex Taq; (17) Ex Taq + TMAC; (18) Kapa2G Robust; (19) Kapa2G Robust + TMAC.
A plot of genome coverage against normalized average depth. Duplicate data sets were normalized and pooled. Variance in coverage above and below the normalized average depth (red vertical line) across the genome is shown. Deviation of sample curves from the average depth indicates level of evenness in coverage depth distribution across the genome. The closer the sample curve is to the vertical line, the more even the coverage. The theoretical curve represents average normalized depth at 100% genome coverage. A) Coverage by libraries made from P. falciparum 3D7 (1 normalized depth represents 21×). B) Coverage by libraries made from clinical isolate, PK0076 (1 normalized depth represents 11×). Kapa HiFi, Kapa2G and Platinum pfx enzymes were used in the presence of TMAC.
GC profile analysis of sequenced data. The GC content distribution for different library preparation methods are shown alongside theoretical data for comparison. A) GC content analysis on libraries prepared from P. falciparum 3D7 with mapped reads normalized to 21× genome coverage. B) GC content of libraries prepared from a clinical isolate (PK0076) with mapped reads normalized to 11× genome coverage. Libraries with GC content above 19.4% (the GC content of the P. falciparum 3D7 reference genome) indicate amplification bias towards templates with neutral GC composition. C) Artemis [9,10] screen view of coverage (mapped reads normalized to 21× genome coverage) for a PCR-free library and four other libraries under test on P. falciparum 3D7 chromosome 1 (zoomed in to show coverage on the GC rich telomere). Kapa HiFi, Kapa2G and Platinum pfx enzymes were used in the presence of TMAC. See additional file 1, Figure S2 A & B for coverage on the entire chromosome 1 and AT-rich locus.
Box plots showing coverage analysis of P. falciparum chromosome 11. (i) P. falciparum 3D7; mapped reads normalized to 21× genome coverage (1 normalized depth represents 21×). (ii) Clinical isolate PK0076; mapped reads normalized to 11× genome coverage (1 normalized depth represents 11×). Subplots B, C and D in both i & ii show coverage of sub-regions of the P. falciparum 3D7 chromosome 11. A) Coverage depth variability plotted for each library on the entire chromosome. B) Distribution of base coverage depth for each library over gene Pf11_0074 and its neighboring introns. C) Distribution of base coverage depth at positions 259985-260864 (extreme AT-region). D) Distribution of base coverage depth at positions 29092-30361 (VAR gene and introns). Top and bottom sides of a box plot represent 75th and 25th percentile of base coverage-depth distribution respectively. The middle line represents 50th percentile. A narrow box indicates less variation in coverage depth across that locus and vice versa. Kapa HiFi, Kapa2G and Platinum pfx enzymes were used in the presence of TMAC. All P. falciparum 3D7and most clinical isolate libraries were prepared in duplicate and each replicate data plotted independently as shown.

Phylogenetic relationships of 75 arthropod and five outgroup species.Aligned sequences for 62 nuclear protein-coding genes were analysed under the likelihood criterion29 using four strategies. Each strategy is designed to minimize deleterious effects of rapid sequence evolution and heterogeneous base composition: degen1, which fully degenerates all codons encoding the same amino acid; noLRall1+nt2, which excludes all third-codon positions and those first-codon positions encoding one or more leucine or arginine codons16; codon model, by which in-frame triplets of nucleotides are analysed directly under a model of codon change30; and amino acid. The degen1 maximum-likelihood topology is shown. Each group of four numbers shows the respective bootstrap percentages calculated using (clockwise from top left) degen1, noLRall1+nt2, amino acid and codon model (see figure key). MLA, maximum-likelihood analysis.
Phylogram of relationships for 75 arthropod and five outgroup species.Based on likelihood analyses of 62 nuclear protein-coding genes. Branch lengths are proportional to the amount of inferred sequence change, with the topology and analytical conditions identical to the degen1 analysis in . Line drawings of representatives of the major taxonomic groups show the morphological disparity across Arthropoda. Scale bar, nucleotide changes per site.
