The virus Rhabdionvims

oryctes, originally discovered in larvae of the coconut palm

dynastid Oryctes rhinoceros in Malaysia, is also pathogenic to second- and early third-

instar larvae of Scapanes austlalis grossepunctatus, a dynastid pest of palms in New

Guinea. Mortality of Scnpanes larvae occurs within 13 to 15 days of infection. Some

older third-instar larvae may be resistant. The possibility of using the virus against

Scnpanes in the field is discussed.

Oryctes rhinoceros is an important pest of coconut palms occurring from India through Southeast Asia, Indonesia, the New Guinea islands, and various islands in the South Pacific. Scapanes australis, of which there are four subspecies,is also a serious pest of palms, but it is restricted to PapuaNew Guinea and the British Solomon Islands. The nonoccluded virus Rhabdionvirus oryctes was discovered in larvae of Oryctes rhinoceros in Malaysia, and its description and symptomatology have been given by Hiiger (1966). The fat body is the first organ affected, and the disease later invades other tissues. The virus was released in Western Samoa in 1967, where it has become established and has markedly reduced the beetle population, and consequently the damage to palms (Marschall, 1970). Further studies have been carried

out on the virus in Samoa by Zelazny (1971). As the virus does not occur in New Guinea, the main aim of the present work was to test it against larvae of the New Guinea rhinoceros beetle, Scapanes au.stralis grossepunctatus, to determine whether these larvae were susceptible to it in the same way as Oryctes, and also to confirm the effect of the virus on Oryctes larvae in New Guinea. Throughout this paper the abbreviations L2 and L3 and used to denote second- and third-instar larvae, respectively.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Two consignments totaling 23 live Oryctes larvae infected with virus were sent from Apia, Western Samoa, for the tests. They were received at Keravat, New Britain, with some 17 of the larvae being freshly dead on arrival, 2 moribund, and 4 living. In the first experiments the virus was obtained from the larvae sent from Apia, but this was later supplemented by virus obtained from artificially infected Keravat larvae. Virus doseswere expressed early in the work as the weight of virus

dead larvae material involved, but later as fractions of one such larva. The virus-infected larvae were homogenized with water in a blendor. Virus material, when not in use, was stored in a freezer below freezing point. Living test larvae were kept individually in half-gallon tins with about 200 g of 1: 1 cowdung: sawdust mixture, and the appropriate dose of homogenized virusinfected larvae was added to each tin and mixed into this medium, on which the test larvae then fed.
RESULTS
Erperiment 1
Twelve fairly advanced Scwpanes thirclinstar larvae were set’ up individually each

with a closeof about 0.3 g of Apia virus-infected larvae and in addition 3.0 g of virus-contaminated medium. Additional doses of virus material were given on later dates. Ten other Scapanes L3 were set up as controls without virus. Eight fielcl-collected Oryctes L3 were set up with virus, and 7 others without. Certain Scapanes larvae accidentally destroyed during the cxperiment were replaced.
Results for the Scapanes larvae with virus are presented in Table 1. Five of the larvae cvcntually died of the virus, showing typical symptoms. The dead larvae, which lay on the top of the medium, were whitish and flaccid in appcarancc, with watery skins which turned black and shiny aftclr death. Seven larvae remnincd unalfcc+c4

and eventually pupated. None of the Acapanes larvae without virus died.
Of the 8 Oryctes larvae set up with virus, 5 died of virus, one died of green muscardine, Metarrhizium, infection, while two pupated and later produced adults. Of the 7 Oryctes larvae without virus, 3 survived, 3 died as prepupae, and one died as a pupa. The deaths as prepupae and pupae were probably due to disturbance during checking.
Experiment 2
As only a limited number of Oryctes larvae were available when the first experiment was set up, a second experiment was later undertaken with more larvae collected from the field, to confirm the virulence of the first batch of virus received from Apia on November 12,197O.
Twenty-five Oryctes L3 were set up in individual tins on November 23, 1970 with 200 g of medium and 1.0 g of virus larvae also 11.0 g of virus-contaminated medium. On November 7, 1970 a further dose of 0.6 g of virus larvae was given to each. Twenty-one L3 were set up similarly but without virus.
Of the virus fed larvae 14, i.e., 56%, died as larvae with typical symptoms by ,January 12, 1971. Two died as larvae later, one died as a prepupa, 6 died as pupae, and 2 survived as a prepupa and an emerged adult. Of the larvae without virus, 9 survived as emerged adults and one as a larva, while 3 died as larvae, 4 as prepupae, and 4 as pupae.
Experiment S
In order to test the virulence against Scapunes of Keravat-produced virus material, 19 Scapanes L3 and 7 L2 were given on January 13, P971 a dose of 0.6 g of virus material derived from infected Oryctes larvae in Experiment 2. The L3 had been in that stage of development only since midDecember or later. Twenty Scapanes I,2 and L3 were held as controls without virus.

Six Oryctes L3 received the same dose of virus as the Scapnnes.
Most of the Scapanesand Oryctes larvae, which had been exposed to virus, were dead with typical virus symptoms within 2 weeks. Only two Scapanes survived, and these were L2 which had molted to the L3 stage during the period of exposure to the virus. None of the Scapanes larvae without virus died.
Experiment 4
To test the virulence of virus material received from Apia on December 14, 1970, 33 field-collected Oryctes L3 were distributed into 20 tins, and each tin received about 0.75 of a homogenized virus larva. Six L3 were kept as controls without virus. All of the thirty-three virus-contaminated larvae died with virus symptoms within a month, but none of the larvae without virus died.
Experiment 5
As a test of the virus material produced in Oryctes larvae in Experiment 4, nine L2 and two L3 Scapanes were distributed in 10 tins on January 28, 1971 and each tin received a dose of 1.8 homogenized virus larvae. Twelve Scapanes L2 were distributed in 10 tins without virus. All the larvae exposed to virus died with typical virus symptoms within 2 weeks, except for one L2 which had molted to L3 during this period. None of the larvae without virus died, and all were healthy L3 on March 22, 1971.
Experiment 6
A small experiment was done to investigate the effect of the virus on two other species on New Guinea dynastid larvae. Eight larvae of the elephant beetle, Xylotrupes gideon Ulysses, (7 L3 and 1 L2), and one larva of Oryctoderus sp. were collected from decaying logs at Keravat on November 16, 1970. Four of the Xylotrztpes L3 and

the one Oryctoderus L3 were set up individually and given the following doses of homogenized virus larvae: 0.3 g on November 16, 1970, 1.0 g on November 24, 1970, and 1.2 g on December 7, 1970. Three Sylotrupes L3 and the one L2 were kept as controls without, virus.
h’one of the Sylotrupes larvae or the singlc Oryctodertts larva showed any adverse effects, and all completed their larval development. The Sylotrupes larvae without virus similarly completed their develop-
1w11t.
DISCUSSION
The results obtained clearly indicate that second- and early third-instar larvae of Scnpanes australis yrossepunctatus are susccptible to Rhabdionvirus.
Although t,here was no opportunity to conduct experiments to attempt the passage of virus from infected Xcapones larvae to healthy Scapanes larvae, it should be noted that in experiments 3 and 5, close to 100% mortality occurred in Scapczneslarvae after 13-15 days of exposure in the food material to virus produced in Oryctes larvae. No mortality occurred in Scapanes larvae without virus. Zclazny (1971) found that death occurred in Oryctes rhinoceros larvae in Samoa 7 to about 22 days after exposure. In Experiment 1, which involved considerably older third-instar Scapanes larvae, results were less clear-cut and 58% of the grubs exposed to virus survived without apparent ill effect. It is possible that some older third-inst’ar Scapanes larvae may be more resistant to the virus or else some larvae may be intrinsically resistant. Hiiger (1966) has shown that larvae of 0. nasimmis are affcctcd RSwell as 0. rhinoceros, and it is of interest to find that larvae of a different, genus, Scapanes, are also affected by the virus.
In Experiments 3 and 5, the only Rcapanes larvae to survive exposure to the virus were three L2 which underwent a molt during the period of exposure. Prior to molting, the larvae cease to feed and

would not ingest the virus-contaminated food medium. Zelazny (1971) has found that in laboratory conditions in Samo:i, some 99% of a given virus dose has broken down after 7 days at room temperat’urr. It is, therefore, possible that by the time the newly emerged L3 resumed feeding, tlrts original virus dose in the medium had broken down, and the larvae thus escnpc~(l infection. The small number of Oryttes larvae which survived exposure to virus in esperiments 1 and 2 may also have survivt~l because they had ceased to feed and were approaching the prepupal stage.
The virulence of the virus against Orycles rhinoceros larvae from the New Guinea population was confirmed in experiments 1, 2, 3, and 4. Mortalit,y which occurretl in the controls during the sensitive prepupal and pupal stages was probably caused by disturbance during checking of the tins and to difficult,ies in molting.
The Sylotlupes larvae in the tclsts did not appear to be susceptible to the virus.
It has been found that’ adults of Or!jctes rhinoceros are also susceptible to the virus, the adult life-span being shortcntd an{1the fecundity of females markedly rccluccd (Zelazny, 1971). In fact the adults art’ the principal agents of spread of the disCaPe. It may be that Rcapanes may bc similarly affected by the virus. If so, this raises the interesting possibility that Sccrpnnesadults might he artificially infe&d, then relcaeed to spread the tliscase among the wild l~opulation and into breeding sites, and thus contribute to the amelioration of the Scnpcrnes problem.
