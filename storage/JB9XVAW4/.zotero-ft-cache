Introduction
The following frames show spatial-temporal changes in numbers of CRB adults caught in pheromone traps. Note that trap catches on Guam are very low: the scale runs from 0 to only 0.02 beetles per trap day, a trap rate of only one beetle every 50 days.

Methods
Interpolated raster maps were made using an R script which: 1. Accesses georeferenced data stored in the CRB project’s online MySQL database. 2. Processes the data using the GRASS6 GIS 3. Writes the LATEX code which generated this PDF document.
