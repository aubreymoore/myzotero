OrNV Witches Brew Experiment: A Last Ditch Attempt to Find Virus Pathogenetic for the Guam Cocoonut Rhinoceros Beetle Genotype

April 30, 2015
Bioassays of several isolates of Oryctes nudivirus provided by AgriResearch New Zealand failed to result in signiﬁcant pathogenicity for the Guam CRB genotype. In a ’last ditch’ attempt we made a ’witches brew’ slurry containing all frozen dead beetles from previous bioassays plus frozen virus samples in vials. Forty adult beetles were forced to swim in the slurry for 30 minutes on January 22, 2015. A control group of 41 beetles were forced to swim in water. Beetles were checked weekly.
By May 10, 2015, mortality of the virus treated beetles (78%) was signiﬁcantly greater than that of the control group (54%).
Methods
Frozen, dead beetles from previous bioassays were added to one liter of water and made into an aqueous slurry using a blender. Vials containing remnants of virus samples from AgResearch New Zealand were agitated in 500 ml of water, and this suspension was added to the blender. The slurry was poured into a small pail and forty beetles were made to swim in this for thirty minutes. A control group of beetles was made to swim in water for thirty minutes.
Beetles were kept individually in Mason jars ﬁlled with commercially blended steer manure and soil. All beetles were checked weekly. Dead beetles were recorded and frozen.
Analysis
Data were analyzed using an IPython notebook (ﬁle name = ’OrNV’). Signiﬁcance of diﬀerences in mortality were determined using a Fisher’s exact test.
Results and Discussion
Cumulative mortality of virus-treated beetles (57%) on April 10 (Fig. 1) was signiﬁcantly greater than that of control beetles (44%); (p = 0.0005; Fisher’s exact test).

Figure 1: Cumulative mortality.
It is unlikely that the beetles which died during the ﬁrst two weeks of the experiment resulted from exposure to virus, so we removed these from the experimental data and repeated the signiﬁcance test. This adjustment did not alter the outcome: Mortality of virus-treated beetles (57%) was signiﬁcantly greater than that of control beetles (44%); (p = 0.0005; Fisher’s exact test).
This experiment is incomplete. A postmortem will be done on the dead beetles and the ’witches brew’ process will be repeated to see if this also results in signiﬁcant mortality.
