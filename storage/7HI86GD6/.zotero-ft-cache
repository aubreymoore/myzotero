SUMMARY
The restriction endonucleases, BamHI, EcoRl, HindlII and PstI, cleave Oryctes baculovirus (strain PV505) DNA into 21, 43, 23 and seven fragments respectively. A large number of these fragments were cloned into the bacterial plasmids pUC8 and pBR328. These clones encompass 96 % of the genome. The restriction sites for the four endonucleases were mapped using double and partial digestions of cloned fragments as well as hybridization of labelled fragments to Southern transfers of cleaved DNA. When HindlII fragment D and BamHI fragment D were hybridized to Southern transfers six regions containing reiterated sequences were found. The physical map for Oryctes baculovirus could not be orientated with respect to other published baculovirus
maps because the BamHI fragment F of Autographa californiea nuclear polyhedrosis
virus which contains conserved polyhedrin gene sequences common to occluded baculoviruses did not bind to Oryctes baculovirus DNA.

INTRODUCTION
Oryctes baculovirus (Huger, 1966) is the type species of the subgroup C baculoviruses (Matthews, 1982). To date, this subgroup contains approximately 15 members isolated from a wide variety of arthropods including arachnids and crustaceans. With the exception of Oryctes baculovirus and the Hz-I virus found in the IMC-Hz-1 cell line none has been characterized beyond its appearance in thin sections viewed with an electron microscope (Crawford & Granados, 1982). Three major differences have been identified between Oryctes baculovirus and the more intensively studied subgroup A baculoviruses: the absence of unenveloped nucleocapsids during virus morphogenesis in the nucleus, the acquisition of a second unit membrane by those particles budded from the plasma membrane, and the absence of any inclusion body production including late protein synthesis (Crawford & Sheehan, 1985).
Physical maps for a small but growing number of baculoviruses have now been published: Autographa ealifornica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) and variants (Miller & Dawes, 1979; Smith & Summers, 1979), Spodoptera.[rugiperda NPV (Loh et al., 1981), Mamestra brassicae NPV (Wiegers & Vlak, 1984), Heliothis zea NPV (Knell & Summers, 1984), Orygia pseudotsugata NPV (Leisy et al., 1984)and ChoristoneurafumiJerana NPV (Arif & Doerfler, 1984). To orientate these circular genomes with respect to one another, the polyhedrin genes, which contain conserved sequences, have been designated as the starting points of baculovirus maps (Vlak & Smith, 1982).
The cloning and mapping of Oryctes baculovirus is described in this paper. Evidence is also presented for the existence of six regions within the genome containing reiterated sequences.

METHODS
Viruses. O0"ctesbaculovirus,strain PV505,was clonedby endpoint dilution as previouslydescribed (Crawford & Sheehan, 1985). Oryctes baculovirus was grown in DSIR-HA1179cells (Crawford, 1982)or adult Oryctes rhinoceros.A. cal(lbrnicaNPV strain HR3 (Brownet al., 1979)and S.[kugiperdaNPV,obtainedfromDr K. Harrap

(tbrmerly of N ERC Institute of Virology, Oxford, U.K.), were grown in IPLB-SF-21 cells (Vaughn et al., 1977). Pur([ication q[ DNA. Adull O. rhinoceros infected with strain PV505 virus were kindly supplied by Dr B.
Zelazny, FAO/UNDP Coconut Pest and Diseases Project, Albay Research Centre, Philippines. Oryctes baculovirus DNA was purified either from pelleted extracellular virus derived from tissue culture or from the midguts of infected adult O. rh#mceros. Five midguts were homogenized together in 2 ml 0.01 m-Tris HC1 pH 7-2, 1 mM-EDTA then centrifuged at low speed (1500g) for 10 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 100 x 1-5 cm controlled pore glass column (Sigma; mesh size 120 to 2001tin, pore diameter 70 nm) and the virus collected from the void volume. The virus was concentrated by centrifugation (100000g, 30 min) and the pellet disrupted by overnight incubation in a solution of 0.1 M-Tris HC1 pH 8-0, 10mM-EDTA, 0-1~ SDS, and proteinase K (100 ;tg/ml). The digested virus was then extracted three times with phenol :chloroform :isopropanol (24:24:1), and precipitated with ethanol using standard methods (Maniatis et aL, 1982).
A. cal(/brnica N PV and S.]i'ugiperda NPV DNA was obtained by pelleting tissue culture-produced extracellular virus (100000 g, 30 min). The pellet was digested, extracted and precipitated exactly as described above.
Restriction and chining q/Oryctes baculot,irus DNA. All digestion of Oryctes baculovirus D N A with BamHI, EcoRI, ltindlll and PstI restriction endonucleases (Amersham) was carried out in TA buffer (33 mm-Tris acetate pH 7.9, 66 raN-potassium acetate, 10 mm-magnesium acetate, 0.5 mg-dithiothreitol). All cloning was carried out using standard methods (Maniatis et al., 1982). All HindIII, BamHI and EcoRI fragments were cloned in the pUC8 vector with Escherichia coli strain J M83 as host cells. The Pstl fragments were cloned into pBR328 in E. coli strain HBIOL cells. Plasmids were purified using the base/acid procedure of Birnboim (1983).
DNA labelling and hybridizatio,. DNA was labelled by nick translation (Rigby et at., 1977) using either [a-~-'P]dCTP or [c~--~-'P]dATP (Amersham). Typical specific activities obtained were 107 c.p.m./~tg. DNA was transferred on to Gene Screen (New England Nuclear) using the procedure described by Smith & Summers 1t980). All hybridizations used to obtain the physical map were performed under stringent conditions at 42 °C in a solution containing 50~o formamide, 0.2o/opolyvinylpyrrolidone, 0-2% bovine serum albumin, 0-2~ Ficoll, 0.05 MTris HCI pH 7.5, 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 10% SDS, 10~%dextran sulphate and 100 ~tg/ml denatured, sonicated calf thymus DN A. Blots were washed using the following protocol : two washes using GS buffer ( 1 x GS buffer is 0.3 M-NaCI, 0.06 M-Tris--HC1 pH 8.0, 2 mM-EDTA) for 5 rain at room temperature, followed by two washes with GS buffer + 1% SDS for 30 rain at 60 °C then two washes with 0.1 x GS buffer for 5 min at room temperature. Filters were then autoradiographed against Kodak X-Ray film using X-Omatic intensifying screens.

RESULTS
Restriction endonuclease digestion
The electrophoresis profiles of Oryctes baculovirus D N A digested with BamHI, EcoRI, Hindlll and PstI restriction endonucleases are shown in Fig. 1. While most fragments could be resolved on 0 . 7 ~ agarose gels, a 2 ~ agarose gel was needed to resolve the smallest BamHI, EcoRI and HindlII fragments. The sizes of the fragments, the method(s) used to determine their position on the physical map and what bacterial plasmids they were cloned into, are shown in Table 1.
Physical map of Oryctes baeulovirus DNA
The physical map of Orvctes baculovirus D N A is shown in linear form in Fig. 2. A total of 94 restriction sites have been mapped on the genome. Details of the experiments performed in order to construct the map are given in Fig. 3. Twenty-five Southern hybridizations using cloned restriction fragments as probes were performed (dark shaded fragments in Fig. 3). Also, six uncloned fragments were excised from agarose gels, labelled, and used as probes (lined shading in Fig. 3). To map the fragments more precisely and to identify and determine the position of very small fragments, restriction of all the cloned fragments with each of the four enzymes was performed. The large PstI fragments B, C, D, E and F cloned in pBR328 (stippled fragments in Fig. 3) were very useful in this regard. It was also necessary to use partial digestion experiments of cloned HindIII fragments E, G and H to order the EcoRI sites within these fragments (data not shown).
Orientation of the physical map
To orientate the genome as suggested by Vlak & Smith (1982) the BamHI fragment F of A. ealiJbrnica NPV was used to probe for a related sequence in Oryctes baculovirus D N A digests. This fragment contains the polyhedrin gene minus its promoter and 171 bases at the 5' end. Five

Fig. 3. Physical map of Oryctesbaculovirus strain PV505 DNA in circular form showing the methods used to elucidate the map. Dark shaded areas indicate cloned fragments (pUC8) used for double digestion experiments and as probes for hybridization. Areas with lined shading show those fragments excised from gels, labelled, then used as probes for hybridization. The stippled PstI fragments were also cloned (pBR328) but were only used in double digestion experiments.
Repeated sequences within the Oryctes baculovirus genome
Evidence for reiterated sequences within the genome was obtained from Southern hybridizations of the Oryctes baculovirus using the cloned HindIII fragment D and BamHI fragment D as probes. The hybridization results (Fig. 5) show the fragments not only binding to their homologous sequences but to five other sites within the Oryctes baculovirus genome. From these data the approximate position of these areas of reiterated sequences could be determined (Fig. 6). The exact size of the homologous regions is not however defined by these data.
DISCUSSION
Oryctes baculovirus DNA appears to have all the features of a typical subgroup A or B baculovirus except it appears to lack the conserved sequences associated with the polyhedrin gene. This is not surprising as these viruses do not have any form of inclusion body. There is also no late gene expression analogous to that of the polyhedrin/granulin gene (Crawford & Sheehan, 1985). Unfortunately it is these conserved sequences which have been used to orientate the previously published maps (Vlak & Smith, 1982). We therefore cannot as yet align our m a p with those previously published. Smith & Summers (1982) have reported that sequences in addition to the polyhedrin gene are conserved between baculoviruses. Leisy et al. (1984) showed that the D N A from two baculoviruses, A. caliJornica N P V and O. pseudotsugata NPV, is predominantly colinear by mapping the shared conserved sequences. Smith & Summers (1982) also showed that slight D N A homology existed between Hz- 1 baculovirus and A. ealiJbrniea NPV, suggesting that there may be some gene sequences shared between subgroup C and subgroup A baculoviruses. Efforts are currently being made to find these common sequences.

Probe binding to the HindllI K/L band, the HindIll O/P band or the EcoR1 d/e band could not identify which of the fragments in these double bands contained the reiterated sequence. When probe binding to all the digests is examined, however, it is clear which of these fragments contains the reiterated sequence. The location of regions containing reiterated sequences was defined as those regions where binding occurs to colinear BamHl, EcoRl and HindIll fragments.
