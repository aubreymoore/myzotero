Abstract—Harmonic radar systems provide an effective modality for tracking insect behavior. This letter presents a harmonic radar system proposed to track the migration of the Emerald Ash Borer (EAB). The system offers a unique combination of portability, low power and small tag design. It is comprised of a compact radar unit and a passive RF tag for mounting on the insect. The radar unit transmits a 5.9–6 GHz signal and detects at the 11.8–12 GHz band. A prototype of the radar unit was built and tested, and a new small tag was designed for the application. The new tag offers improved harmonic conversion efﬁciency and much smaller size as compared to previous harmonic radar systems for tracking insects. Unlike RFID detectors whose sensitivity allows detection up to a few meters, the developed radar can detect a tagged insect up to 58 m (190 ft).

I. INTRODUCTION
H ARMONIC radars have been used to track insects for 20 years [1]–[9]. However, existing radars either use low frequencies not suited for small tags or transmit high power (tens of kilowatts) severely limiting portability, so the successful tracking rate is very low. This letter presents an insect radar system that offers a combination of portability, low-power operation, and tag miniaturization not currently available in modern insect radars. The motivation is to allow the tracking of the Emerald Ash Borer (EAB), an exotic beetle native to Asia. EAB has caused tens of millions of dollars damage to ash trees in North America since 2002. The dispersal and behavioral patterns of EAB are needed to aid development of appropriate treatment and management strategies. Tracking EAB is an essential part of dispersal and behavioral studies.
The proposed harmonic radar relies on a small radio frequency (RF) tag attached to a captured and released insect. The system’s unique features are portability, low power operation, and small tag design, coupled with a remarkably large detection distance. Speciﬁcally, the prototype was shown to track the small RF tag up to a range of approximately 58 m (190 ft). The radar is powered by a 12 V alarm battery and is compact enough (excluding the antennas) to be placed in a small backpack. Compared to units with output powers on the order

this application [3]–[5], the proposed tag is conformal to the

insect’s body.

II. RADAR SUBSYSTEM
The radar tracking system is comprised of two components: the radar unit and the RF tag. The radar unit transmits a 5.9–6 GHz signal and detects the 11.8–12 GHz harmonic created by the tag. A system schematic is depicted in Fig. 1 and a photograph of the prototype system is given in Fig. 2, all built with commercially available parts. As shown, to generate the 5.9–6-GHz transmit signal, the output of a 5-GHz dielectric resonator oscillator (DRO) and the output of a stable 0.9–1 GHz auxiliary oscillator are mixed. The prototype system exhibited similar performance when the auxiliary oscillator frequency was 0.9 GHz and when the oscillator frequency was 1.0 GHz. It was found necessary that the transmit signal be sufﬁciently ﬁltered to remove harmonics, as false positive detection scenarios can occur if the harmonic is transmitted. The received 11.8–12 GHz signal must also be ﬁltered prior to ampliﬁcation to remove any coupled or reﬂected transmitted (5.9–6 GHz) signal. That is, if the transmit signal is ampliﬁed in the receive circuit, it can create harmonics, resulting in false positive detections.
Detection occurs at 1.8–2.0 GHz. A 10-GHz signal is mixed with the received signal to generate the observed (1.8–2 GHz) IF signal. It should be noted that the harmonic of the 5 GHz DRO is isolated and ampliﬁed to generate the 10 GHz signal. The two circuits (5 and 10 GHz) are separated with a Wilkinson power divider. This design ensures that the observed IF is stable in spite of any frequency drift exhibited by the DRO, and also eliminates the need for another oscillator. The observed IF signal can be detected with a spectrum analyzer, RFID detection system or RF signal detection chip (such as the Analog Devices AD608).
Electromagnetic interference considerations are critical to a successful design as internal harmonics of the auxiliary oscillator signal or the transmit signal can allow the system to register false detections. To eliminate such issues, the low noise block, auxiliary oscillator, and the rest of the system were placed in three separate, tightly sealed boxes (see Fig. 2). Also, the buffer in the transmit circuit must provide sufﬁcient isolation so that the auxiliary oscillator and/or transmit signals do not leak into the receive circuit through the DRO or power divider.
A power budget analysis for the radar system is given in Table I. In the analysis, it is assumed that the radar detects the

III. TAG DESIGN

A. Geometry

The proposed tag is a planar geometry (that is easily bent)

comprised of two concentric (modiﬁed) Minkowski loops (see

Fig. 3). The Minkowski loop is a fractal geometry which is re-

ﬁned iteratively as shown in Fig. 4. The Minkowski loop antenna

has been shown to be a suitable miniaturized alternative to the

square loop antenna [10]–[13]. Unlike the antennas in [11], [12],

the proposed tag employs a set of modiﬁed Minkowski loops.

These loops were altered to meet the fabrication constraints im-

posed by the tag’s smaller size (due to higher operational fre-

quencies). A similar alteration was made in [13], for a fractal-

based slot antenna. The design measures 9.5 mm 9.5 mm, or

at

GHz.

B. Tag Operation and Diode Considerations
The tag intercepts the transmitted signal from the radar unit (5.9–6 GHz) and reradiates the harmonic at 11.8–12 GHz. As in other harmonic radar tags [14], a very small and light (low barrier) Schottky diode is positioned between the two loops as shown in Fig. 3. As the antenna is excited by the impinging radar wave, a current is induced through the diode which (due to its non-linearity) creates the re-radiated harmonic. Given the size and weight requirements of this application, the Avago/Agilent HSCH-5340 was found as a suitable diode for the tag. Schottky diodes, such as this one, operate with a low forward voltage drop. This is critical for the application, since the expected induced voltage is very small.
C. Tag Performance
The simulated gain patterns of the tag are given in Fig. 6–8. The disparity in gain between the co-polarization patterns and the cross-polarization patterns demonstrates the antenna’s strong linear polarization. The maximum low mode gain is about 2.8 dBi (see Fig. 5), whereas the maximum high mode gain is about 5.5 dBi (see Fig. 6). However, the low- and high-mode maximum gain points do not occur in the same

direction. In testing, the tag surface was placed normal to the

direction of incidence (direction of maximum low mode gain).

The approximate conversion loss of the modiﬁed Minkowski

loop tag was measured to be 11 dB at

GHz. This

conversion loss corresponds to the power differential between

an incident signal and the resulting re-radiated signal. This is

an improvement over the loop-dipole tag, a resonant tag shown

in Fig. 8, previously used in harmonic radars for insect tracking

[3]–[5]. The improvement is signiﬁcant since a tag with lower

conversion loss is capable of a longer detection range. A loop-

dipole tag, which consists of a half wavelength dipole for the

low mode and a single wavelength loop for the high mode, was

built and the conversion loss was measured as 16 dB. Also, in

V. CONCLUSION

A portable harmonic radar system for insect tracking was de-

signed and tested. The system offers a unique combination of

portability, low power output, and small tag design. The built

prototype demonstrated that a tag of size 9.5 mm 9.5 mm

can be detected up to 58 m (190 ft) when

the unit transmits 0.1 W, uses 22 dBi transmit and receive an-

tennas, and operates at

GHz. Studies will be continued

to investigate methods of mounting the miniaturized tag on EAB

with minimal interference with movement and behavior of the

insect.

another insect radar system study (where a loop-dipole tag was used), the conversion loss was reported as 21 dB [3]. The modiﬁed Minkowski loop tag offers improvements in size, gain, conversion efﬁciency, and conformability.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Range measurements were conducted using a prototype

radar unit. The IF signal, viz., the signal fed into the “Received

Signal Strength Indicator” shown in Fig. 1, was measured as a

Minkowski loop tag (shown in Fig. 3) was moved to varying

ranges from the transmitting radar unit’s antennas. The exper-

iment was conducted outdoors in a ﬂat, dry ﬁeld. The system

was operating at

GHz and the RF power output

was measured to be approximately dBm. The transmit and

receive antennas, both horns with gains of approximately 22

dBi at the respective relevant frequencies, were placed about 5

ft above the ground. Also, the tag was placed on a thin layer of

foam and mounted atop a wooden stand 5 ft above the ground.

The IF strength measurements were performed with a spectrum

analyzer, where (two point) averaging was employed and the

resolution bandwidth was set to 30 Hz, producing a noise ﬂoor

of approximately 97 dBm (caused by ampliﬁcation in the

receive circuit).

The measurement results given in Fig. 9 show that the system

was able to reliably detect the Minkowski loop tag up to a range

of 58 m (190 ft). It is also evident from the plot that when the

measurements were taken that ground effects are pronounced,

reducing the detection distance. That is, for a radar operating

in free space, the power received from a backscattering target

would decay as
