<h2><a href="https://aubreymoore.github.io/crop-pest-list/list.html">Click here to view the List of Insects and Mites Attacking Crops in Micronesia</a></h2>      

<p>The <b>List of Insects and Mites Attacking Crops in Micronesia</b> was originally compiled during the early 1990s by Dr. Don Nafus and Dr. Ilse Schreiner, former entomologists at the University of Guam. The list was converted to HTML by Dr. Aubrey Moore and Anthony Tudela at Northern Marianas College (NMC) in the late 1990s and made available online via the now defunct NMC CSREES web site. More recently, the list was made available on the University of Guam Cooperative Extension Service Knowledgebase Wiki web site which was closed to the public in 2015 following spamming and hacking attacks.</p>

<p>The list is badly in need of updating following recent arrival of new pests in Micronesia, geographical range expansions within the region and name changes. However, it still proves useful in its present form. The intent of these GitHub pages and associated repository is to provide a temporary home for the list while it is reworked and improved.</p>
