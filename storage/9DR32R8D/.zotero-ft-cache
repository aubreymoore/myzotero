Abstract. Protocols for pheromone-based mass-trapping of the Asian palm weevil, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier), are presented. The aggregation pheromone, ferrugineol (4-methyl-5-nonanol) released at 3 mg per 24 h was numerically, but not statistically, superior to lower doses, and this rate is recommended for operational trapping programmes. Trap captures were maximized by placing traps at ground level or 2 m high. Vane traps were superior to bucket traps. Insecticidefree traps containing funnels to prevent weevil escape were equally as effective as traps using insecticide to retain weevils. Synergism between ferrugineol and host palm volatiles was demonstrated and necessitates the inclusion of palm material in traps for maximum trapping efficacy. Both the Asian palm weevil and coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros, were captured in the same traps without interference between their respective pheromones. These results have led in part to pheromone-based mass-trapping of the Asian palm weevil throughout the Middle East where the weevil is a serious introduced pest of date palms.
1. Introduction
The Asian palm weevil, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier) ( = R. vulneratus = R. schach) (Hallett, 1996) is one of the most destructive pests of coconut, Cocos nucifera L., in South and Southeast Asia (Sivapragasam et al., 1990; Sadakathulla, 1991). During the last decade, multiple introductions of R. ferrugineus to the Middle East from Pakistan and India have occurred and the Asian palm weevil (APW) is now a serious pest of date palms, Phoenix sylvestris Roxb., in the Arab Gulf States (Bokhari and Abuzuhari, 1992) and Egypt (RHH, ACO, personal observation).
Often, palm weevil infestations are not detected before damage caused by larval mining in the trunk is extensive, and it is not possible for the tree to recover (Sivapragasam et al., 1990). In date palms, the only visible sign of attack may be oozing of palm sap from the trunk, and infestations are often not discovered until trees are blown over.
Current control methods include surveys to identify infested palms, removal, burning or burial of heavily infested trees, injection of insecticides into infested palms diagnosed as recoverable, and spraying of insecticides on all palms in infested areas. Burning of palm trunks is often incomplete, so that larvae and pupae survive and complete development. Delay between detection and destruction of an infested tree permits emergence

and migration of adult weevils prior to destruction. Transporting infested trees and off-shoots for burning introduces the weevil to new areas.
Use of fumigant insecticides within infested trunks is unsatisfactory as penetration of insecticidal gas throughout the trunk is hampered by thick plugs of larval frass (Abraham et al., 1998). Soaking of palm trunks with insecticides every 2 months has been recommended to prevent egg laying (Abraham et al., 1998). However, these practices result in the use of high volumes of insecticide and have potentially negative environmental and public health impacts.
Ferrugineol (4-methyl-5-nonanol) is a major aggregation pheromone of the APW (Hallett et al., 1993), and has been used in conjunction with 4-methyl-5-nonanone (Abozuhairah et al., 1996) in mass-trapping programmes throughout the Middle East since 1995. Mass-trapping with rhynchophorol, 6-methyl-2(E)hepten-4-ol, has been shown to reduce populations of the American palm weevil, R. palmarum (L.); concurrently, the incidence of red ring disease, which is vectored by the weevil, was also reduced in Costa Rican oil palm plantations (Chinchilla et al., 1993; Oehlschlager et al., 1993, 1995).
In many countries, traps made of palm stems or petioles have been used to capture Rhynchophorus spp. (Abraham and Kurian, 1975; Abraham et al., 1989; Morin et al., 1986; Sivapragasam et al., 1990). Such traps are not entirely satisfactory, because they are labour-intensive, require weekly replacement, and their attractiveness varies considerably with environmental conditions (Chinchilla and Oehlschlager, 1992; Nagnan et al., 1992). Host kairomones have been identified for R. palmarum (Nagnan et al., 1992), R. phoenicis F. (Gries et al., 1994) and R. cruentatus F. (Weissling et al., 1992; Giblin-Davis et al., 1994) and R. ferrugineus (Oehlschlager, unpublished data). A synergistic interaction between palm volatiles and ferrugineol was suggested in an earlier study (Hallett et al., 1993a).
Since palm weevils rely on wounds to gain access to stem tissue for oviposition, it is possible that APW responds to the pheromones and/or frass produced by coconut rhinoceros beetle adults (CRB), Oryctes rhinoceros (L.), feeding in palm crowns. A pheromone-based mass-trapping programme for CRB has been developed (Hallett et al., 1995; Chung, 1996;

Trapping protocols for APW in date palm plantings in desert regions have been established by other researchers in the Middle East (Abozuhairah et al., 1996). Herein we present the results of studies designed to develop pheromone-based masstrapping protocols for APW in coconut plantations in the humid tropics, where CRB co-exists with APW. Results of a trap design experiment for use in date palm plantings are also presented.

Traps with high pheromone placement had lures suspended in a slot 24 cm above the bucket rim, while those with low pheromone placement had lures suspended in a slot at the level of the bucket rim. This experiment was conducted at Bah

2. Materials and methods
Release devices and release rates for Experiments 1 ± 7 are given in table 1. All experiments were of randomized complete block design. Unless otherwise indicated, inter-trap and interblock distances were 24 and 70 m, respectively.

2.1. Pheromone dose response
Experiment 1 was conducted to determine the activity and optimal dose of ferrugineol at Pakuwon Coconut Research Station, Pakuwon, West Java, Indonesia (14 ± 27 August 1992; N = 20). Ferrugineol was released at 0, 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg per 24 h from standard white bucket traps (figure 1) (Oehlschlager et al., 1993) attached 2 m high to coconut palms. All traps contained 2 kg of 1-day-old coconut palm wood pieces (approx.
5 ´5 ´20 cm3 ) treated with Basudin 60EC (diazinon; Ciba-
Geigy), 0.24% a.i. in water, to retain captured weevils.

2.2. Trap height
To determine optimum trap height Experiment 2 was conducted at Pakuwon (30 October± 13 November 1993; N = 10). Standard white bucket traps were placed at ground level, or at 2, 5, or 10 m above ground. All traps were attached to coconut palms and contained ferrugineol and 1 kg palm wood treated with 0.3% a.i. solution of diazinon.
2.3. Trap design
Efficacy of the standard white bucket trap was compared in Experiment 3 with three insecticide-free trap designs (funnel

Standard bucket trap: 20 L white bucket with four slots around rim just below lid and four openings on lid to allow weevil entry and dissemination of volatiles (Oehlschlager et al., 1993b); lures suspended 3 ± 4 cm below lid of bucket. Inverted bucket trap: same as standard bucket trap, except trap inverted; four flaps around top of trap for weevil entry, and lure suspended from inside top of trap. Funnel trap: same as standard bucket trap, except with funnel inserted below side entry slots in order to prevent escape by captured weevils. Vane trap with funnel: same buckets as above, used without lid, with two unpainted metal vanes at right angles to each other to increase barrier surface and multidirectionality of trap; fitted with funnel below vanes to prevent weevil escape;
lure suspended from central slot in vanes.

Lias Estate, London Sumatra Indonesia Plantation Company, North Sumatra, Indonesia (18 February± 19 March 1994; N = 10). All traps contained ferrugineol and half coconut husks (fresh, young coconuts with flesh removed). Only coconut husks in the standard bucket traps were treated with insecticide (0.3% a.i. diazinon).
The funnel and vane + funnel traps were compared in Experiment 4 with vane + funnel traps with black painted vanes at Bah Lias Estate (11 ± 25 April 1994; N = 15) in a mixed cocoacoconut planting. Intertrap and interblock distances were 45 m. All traps contained ferrugineol and half coconut husks.
In short date palms, the presence of unsevered leaf axils minimized contact between standard bucket traps and the trunk. Black buckets were more readily obtainable than white buckets in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Consequently, the standard trap (white upright) was compared with three other trap designs in Experiment 5 (inverted white bucket, upright black bucket and inverted black bucket) (figure 1) in Ras Al Kaimeh, UAE (12 ± 20 June 1993; N = 10). White buckets available in the UAE were very glossy such that weevils could not easily climb into the traps. Thus, surfaces of all white traps were roughened to permit APW to enter the traps. Inverted bucket traps had entry holes near the top and bottom of bucket and all traps contained ferrugineol and date palm tissue soaked in 0.3% a.i. solution of Lannate.

analysed by x 2 tests (Zar, 1984). In these cases, treatment, sex, and species comparisons were also performed using x 2
tests. Due to the synonymization of R. ferrugineus and R.
vulneratus (Hallett, 1996), all data for the two colour morphs were pooled.
3. Results
3.1. Pheromone dose response
In Experiment 1, all doses of ferrugineol were significantly and equally more attractive to R. ferrugineus than palm alone (figure 2). However, capture rates at the highest dose (3.0 mg per 24 h) were nearly 1.5 times greater than at the lower dose (0.1 mg per 24 h). Therefore a release rate of 3 mg per 24 h, was used in all other experiments.
3.2. Trap height
Bucket traps at ground level caught significantly more weevils than at 5 m high, while those at 2 m were intermediate in effectiveness between those at ground level and at 5 m high (Experiment 2, figure 3). Traps at 10 m caught no weevils.

2.4. Pheromone± host volatile interactions
To examine synergism between host volatiles and ferrugineol and to determine whether the inclusion of host plant material would improve the trapping programme, Experiment 6 was conducted at Pakuwon (4 ± 11 August 1993 and 8 ± 14 October 1993; N = 20) using standard bucket traps baited with ferrugineol and coconut palm tissue (1 kg), ferrugineol and insecticide-treated sponge (or towel), palm tissue alone, and sponge (or towel) alone. In all cases, palm tissue, sponges and towels were treated with a 0.3% a.i. solution of diazinon. Sponges and towels were used in 10 replicates each.
2.5. Dual trapping
To determine whether APW and CRB could be caught in the same traps, Experiment 7 tested vane + funnel traps containing either the CRB aggregation pheromone (ethyl 4-methyloctanoate, oryctalure), ferrugineol or both, set out in a mixed cocoa/ coconut planting at Bah Lias Estate (27 April ± 7 June 1994; N = 28).

2.6. Statistical analyses
In all field experiments, no significant differences were found
in the responses of male and female beetles (x 2 test, P > 0.05),
so catches were pooled by sex for analysis. Data were transformed by loge (x+1) if they were not normally distributed and were subjected to ANOVA (General Linear Modelling) (Minitab, 1989). If replicates were run at different times or
locations, data were analysed for time ´ treatment or location ´ treatment interactions. Following ANOVA, multiple pairwise
comparisons were made using Bonferroni t-tests. If homoscedasticity was not achieved by transformation, data were

same letter are not significantly different, x 2 test, P < 0.05. Trap captures were
too low to permit comparison of traps at 5 and 10 m, but all other pairwise comparisons were made.

3.3. Trap design
All four types of traps examined in Experiment 3 were equally effective (figure 4). Painting the sheet metal vanes black in Experiment 4 resulted in significantly more weevils being captured than in funnel traps (figure 4). Unpainted vane traps were intermediate in effectiveness.
In the UAE, black inverted bucket traps were most attractive, followed by black upright traps (figure 5, Experiment 5). No weevils were captured in white bucket traps regardless of their position.

3.4. Pheromone ± host volatile interactions
Captures of APW in Experiment 6 were greatest in traps containing both ferrugineol and palm (figure 6), and were more than the sum of catches in traps containing these components individually. Captures were highest 3 ± 5 days after cutting of palm tissue.
3.5. Dual trapping
While there were significant differences between treatments for both APW and CRB, no differences were found for either

species in Experiment 7 between traps containing their own pheromone and those containing both pheromones (figure 7). Traps containing the pheromone of one species were not attractive to beetles of the other species.
4. Discussion Since ferrugineol released at 3 mg per 24 h (under
laboratory conditions, 258 C), was most attractive to the APW (figure 2), this release rate is recommended for operational use. Lures patterned after the 3 mg per 24 h lure are now used operationally in the Middle East. These lures release 3 ± 10 mg per day depending on the season (V.A. Abraham, unpublished data).
The decline in efficacy of trapping APW when traps were
> 2 m high (figure 3) appears to be in contrast to findings for R.
palmarum, for which no differences in trapping efficacy were found for bucket traps placed on palms at heights between 0 and 3.3 m (Oehlschlager et al., 1993). However, Oehlschlager

et al. (1993) did find that when traps were placed between palms, those on the ground were significantly more effective than traps placed on poles.
Traps previously developed for Rhynchophorus spp. include traps made from palm logs or split palm petioles (Sivapragasam et al., 1990), sandwich traps and bucket traps (Oehlschlager et al., 1993). Oehlschlager et al. (1993) also evaluated the efficacy of McPhail traps (White and Elson-Harris, 1992) and multiplefunnel traps (Lindgren, 1983), but found that bucket traps were most effective in trapping the American palm weevil.
The greater response of the APW to black than white buckets (figure 5) and to vane traps with black-painted vanes over those with reflective unpainted vanes (figure 4) may result from higher pheromone release rates from black traps due to heating of the vanes. Alternately, it may suggest that vision is important in host selection by these species. Visual discrimination between acceptable and unacceptable host silhouettes has been hypothesized in the mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (Borden et al., 1986) and demonstrated in the white pine weevil, Pissodes strobi Peck (VanderSar and Borden, 1977a), which selects feeding and oviposition sites by positive phototaxis and negative geotaxis (VanderSar and Borden, 1977b).
Inclusion of palm material in traps is essential (figure 6) as host volatiles have a striking synergistic effect on APW response to ferrugineol. Unfortunately, palm or other plant material require frequent replacement for maximum trapping efficacy. Studies to identify longer-lasting food sources and host kairomones are underway in the Gulf States where this weevil is a problem.
The absence of a reciprocal inhibiting effect of either the pheromone of APW or CRB on the other species (figure 7) suggests that these species do not interact competitively when colonizing the same host. Lack of heterospecific pheromone interference means that wherever both CRB and APW are considered to be problems, the same traps can be used to capture both species, without any increase in the cost of trapping system maintenance. Trapping of two species together or alone with equal efficiency has also been demonstrated for Metamasius hemipterus and R. palmarum (Chinchilla et al., 1996) and M. hemipterus and Cosmopolites sordidus (Oehlschlager et al., 1998).

The capture of a few APWs in traps containing only oryctalure may be indicative of a slight cross-attraction. Cross-attraction would be expected when one species exploits the pheromone of a co-inhabiting species in order to colonize a host most efficiently (Birch, 1984). Strong crossattraction may not occur because the CRB may also release aggregation pheromone in its breeding sites (e.g. rotting trunks, compost piles), which are unsuitable for palm weevil brood production.
The low trap captures in some experiments should not be used as an argument against a mass-trapping control programme for these palm pests. Large insects generally have low population densities, e.g. 23 ± 57 R. palmarum per ha in a large Costa Rican oil palm plantation (Chinchilla et al., 1993). Moreover, the capture of a single female can have a tremendous impact because each female is capable of laying several hundred eggs (Kalshoven, 1950). If trapping is continued over several generations, eventually emerging weevils that have not yet started new infestations may be captured, and damage rates may be reduced rapidly. In the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Oman, where APW is causing severe damage to date palms, mass-trapping is considered to be a viable method of control. Trapping is being conducted by local Ministries of Agriculture and is supported by local governments, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and by the Arab Organization for Agricultural Development. At least one Gulf country (UAE) has significantly decreased reliance on spraying insecticides to kill weevils outside palms (A. Azziz, personal communication). Mass-trapping of the American palm weevil, R. palmarum, has been credited with reducing weevil populations, maintaining them at a low density, and also reducing the incidence of the nematode-caused red ring disease, which is vectored by R. palmarum (Chinchilla et al., 1993; Oehlschlager et al., 1995).
We have demonstrated that the APW can be captured effectively in an insecticide-free trap, and that pheromone-based trapping for APW and CRB can be superimposed. Development of an optimally effective and persistent host kairomonal stimulus would further improve the trapping program. Even without effective kairomones, the potential for control of R. ferrugineus by mass-trapping with pheromones is great.
