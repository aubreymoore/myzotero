MISSION STATEMENT
The Guam Invasive Species Council protects Guam from alien species that threaten the economy, culture, ecosystem and human health through policy direction, coordination and planning for the prevention, control, monitoring and eradication.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The 2017-2019 Interim Guam Invasive Species Management Plan (GISMP) expresses the overarching goals and priorities of the Guam Invasive Species Council (GISC or Council).
The Guam Invasive Species Act of 2011 (Public Law 31-43) established the Council as Guam’s lead entity in coordinating with local, regional, national, and international jurisdictions in the fight against alien invasive species. Although the GISC is in its infancy stages of organization, it draws from the collective knowledge, past research, and progress of its members in establishing the Council’s goals and priorities.
Priorities and goals identified in this plan reflect current and near-term resources, member capabilities, and status of certain invasive species. Recommendations contained in the Regional Biosecurity Plan for Micronesia and Hawaii (RBP), the 2016-2018 National Invasive Species Council’s Management Plan, the Regional Invasive Species Council (RISC), and various stakeholders were considered in the development of this plan. The Council also considered developments under the purview of the Hawaii Invasive Species Council and its 2015-2020 HISC Strategic Plan.

INTRODUCTION

History Of Invasive Species On Guam

Guam’s history of introduced species is a mixture of deliberate and accidental introductions. Deliberate introductions may include rice brought in by early Chamorro settlers or domestic farm animals introduced during the Spanish colonial period. Accidental introductions are commonly referred to as invasive species that include rodents, insects, agricultural pests, plants, and disease-causing pathogens.

Prior to Ferdinand Magellan’s landing in 1521, the Chamorro people inhabited the Mariana Islands for 4,000 years and likely brought rice with them for cultivation. Their survival rested largely on a subsistence economy where they harvested coconut, root crops, and fish. They continued to practice subsistence farming up until the 1950s. Chamorro people produced primarily for two reasons: survival and the reciprocal practice of exchanging of gifts for goods and services. This system of exchange, or chenchule’, is a Chamorro core value
still practiced today.

Magellan’s passage to the Philippines eventually established the Galleon Trade Route. Galleon ships traveled often between Acapulco, Mexico and Manila, Philippines. Guam was signaled as a convenient port stop between the West and the East during the Spanish Colonial Era. Spanish and other European vessels frequently stopped in the Mariana Islands, trading iron and other goods for food and water with the Chamorro people. Through these years, domestic animals such as deer, swine, and cattle, were introduced in these series of trades with the Chamorro people. Some of these species were purposed for sustenance; other animals like the carabao were introduced to the island for farming and transportation. Most of these intentional introductions included species from both the Philippines and Mexico and can still be found today. These feral ungulates like the deer, pig, and carabao roam wild in

parts of Guam. The feral swine population continues to grow and because of their burrowing, they have become a significant threat to crops, native trees, the coral reef, and to humans.

Introduced species aren’t always intentional. Unintended introductions included other animals, pests, plants, and diseases. Possible pathways for entry of invasives included stowaway rodents and pests hidden in cargo container disembarking the ships. They carried in with them disease-causing pathogens like bacteria and fungi that tainted agricultural crops and livestock; subsequently, increasing illness and death among the Chamorro people.

A common known invasive weed is the Antigonon leptopus. It is

known locally as kadena, in Chamorro, and “Chain of Love” in Eng-

lish. The kadena is found in Mexico where it also gets its common name, Mexican Creeper. The kadena was likely introduced during

the Spanish colonial period of Guam. The kadena spreads far and wide and completely

“climbs” over a host of other trees and plants. This vine can choke smaller plants and trees

and prevent photosynthesis by blocking sunlight from reaching those plants.

TOP: “Chain of Love” Antigonon leptopus or kadena growth in Guam. LOWER: Leucaena leucocephala or tangantångan growth in Guam, with seed pods.

World War II left the island of Guam devastated. The extensive bombing of Guam by American forces to drive out the Japanese soldiers left the island’s forested areas almost completely bare and devoid of foliage. Erosion set in and in effort to mitigate it, the Naval government airdropped thousands of Leucaena leucocephala, or tangantångan, seeds across the island. The tangantångan, a type of legume that fixes nitrogen in the soils needed for plant growth through its nitrogen fixing nodes in its root systems, quickly grew atop the war-torn eroded areas. The island saw almost immediate regrowth of vegetation. Today, tangantångan provides the local population with various uses such as firewood, timber, shade and compost. While it was well intended, the introduction of the tangantångan also came at a cost. Because tangantångan grows so quickly and produces an abundance of seed pods, they are literally invasive since they quickly occupy space that would otherwise be taken up by a native plant species. Today, reforestation efforts utilize acacia trees instead of the tangantångan; although an alien species, acacia trees prove to be as effective and particularly invasive.

pets in recent years. Some of these intentional releases are committed by pet owners avoiding proper clearances and have even included a pair of pythons. Less exotic animals such as nonnative fresh water fish, are found in the island’s rivers and streams.

The most commonly known unintended introduction and perhaps

the most impactful is the Brown Tree Snake (BTS). Shortly after

World War II, the island was bustling with military activity to

rebuild the island’s civilian dwellings and businesses, as well as

develop and strengthen the United States’ military bases. Military

cargo ships arrived and departed daily. Among these arrivals

included a cargo ship from Manus Island, Papua New Guinea.

Aboard this vessel was most likely a single pregnant female brown

tree snake. It escaped the vessel and it made its home in the island’s jungle. The BTS would thrive on an abundant food source

of mostly birds and lizards across the island ultimately causing the extinction and extirpa-

tion of many native and endemic species. The loss of pollinating birds and even the fruit bat

negatively affects forest regeneration and forest structure on Guam.

The BTS’s devastating impact isn’t limited to ecological systems but also on the economy. In the mid-1980s, it was discovered that the BTS was largely responsible for the island’s frequent power outages as they coiled around power lines. Property damages and repairs are reported to have cost the government millions of dollars. This prompted federal and local government officials to work collaboratively to establish a regulatory framework in which the BTS is managed. This framework includes the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the Memorandum of Agreement on Control of the Brown Tree Snake in 1993, and the Executive Order 13112, Invasive Species in 1999. In 2004, Congress passed the Brown Tree Snake Control and Eradication Act which enabled the formulation of the BTS Technical Work Group (TWG). Since that time, the BTS TWG have made significant progress towards preventing the escape of the BTS from Guam to other locations; reducing their impact on Guam’s ecosystems; and develop steps leading to eradication.

Over 50 years after the introduction of the BTS and numerous other damaging species, the government of Guam recognized the dangerous but silent invasion of alien invasive species on the island. In 2005, Governor Felix P. Camacho issued Executive Order 2005-13 relative to the invasive species control and interdiction, which established the Guam Invasive Species Council (GISC), its members and officers, duties and responsibilities, and calling for the draft of an invasive species management plan. While well-intentioned, the efforts to control and prevent invasive species on island did not take traction.

In 2007, Guam faced a new foe in the Oryctes rhinoceros, commonly known as the Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle (CRB), when it was first noticed in Tumon Bay. The CRB is a major pest of

the coconut palm, oil palm and other species. Palms are damaged when adult beetles bore into the crowns of palms to feed on sap. Preferred breeding sites are dead, standing coconut stems, and piles of decaying vegetation. Guam, prone to typhoons that leave behind piles of green debris, and the abundance of coconut trees on island make for ideal conditions for the CRB to thrive. The CRB is native to Southeast Asia, primarily in Indonesia and the Philippines. We still do not know how the CRB arrived on Guam but the College of Natural and Applied Sciences at the University of Guam suspects their arrival likely came by way of a shipping container of construction materials and long before they were noticed.

In 2011, reports of Wasmannia auropunctata, or the Little Fire Ant (LFA), received highest of concerns since they deliver a very painful sting and can cause an extremely itchy rash. The introduction of the LFA, CRB, BTS and countless other harmful species causing harm to the island’s economic and human health, prompted the Guam Legislative to pass Bill 111-31, calling for the formal establishment of the Guam Invasive Species Council, collecting of a biosecurity fee, and the authorization of the Department of Agriculture to establish a Biosecurity Division. The bill was signed into law on May 17, 2011 by Governor Eddie Baza Calvo as the Guam Invasive Species Council Act of 2011. In 2014, the GISC began quarterly meetings to lay the groundwork in carrying out the mandates of the law.

In 2016, the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) Assistant Secretary of Insular Areas, Esther Kia’aina, charged the territories with strengthening their defense systems against the threats of alien invasive species. DOI made grants available to the territories for the purposes of drafting their own invasive species management plans and has expressed commitments that future grant-funding will be made available for the sake of fighting against invasive species at all borders. At this time, none of the U.S. territories have issued an invasive species management plan and so far there has never been such a plan adopted by any of the territories. The determination of GISC to submit a plan for Guam demonstrates the diligence of the Council, and the support of Governor Calvo and DOI. Despite the Council’s infancy GISC members and stakeholders have been working in the fight against alien invasive species for many years and recognize the opportunities in unifying its efforts.

Scope Of The Invasive Species Problem__________________________________
Guam’s rate of introduced species is alarmingly high. Dr. Aubrey Moore, entomologist with the University of Guam’s College of Natural and Applied Sciences recorded sixty known invertebrates since 2000. This is an average of at least three per year. Dr. Moore further reports that before human intervention, species arrived every few thousand years, and today, one new species arrives on Guam every few months. This is 10,000 times the natural rate.

2017-2019 Interim Guam Invasive Species Management Plan

05

The scope of Guam’s invasive species problem rests largely with securing pathways to entry of all plant and animal species into Guam, and human intervention. Guam’s borders must be strengthened by improving its capabilities in the prevention of alien invasive species from not only reaching the shores of Guam but entering our neighbors in the region like the Northern Marianas, the rest of Micronesia and Hawaii. As the main gateway between the west and east, GISC intends to rally more federal and local government support to build upon Guam’s existing efforts towards biosecurity.

Threats of alien invasive species on Guam are detrimental and a singular pest requires a system of technical approaches from understanding what its predators are, habitats, and other characteristics to identifying the appropriate biocontrols that are effective and do not pose inadvertent harm to the ecosystems they’re applied in. Eradication is a term loosely used in conversation and really depends on a range of factors to include how early a new pest is detected, location of detection, and what resources are available for eradication. Because eradication is costly it enforces the immediate need to strengthen prevention measures.

Environmental, Human And Economic Costs To Guam Environmental And Human Health Costs________________________________

Endemic or native species are at risk of extinction because they have not evolved defenses against alien predators, parasites, and diseases. Further, when native plant and animal populations are removed from an ecosystem there are cascading effects as a result. Food webs and habitats are interrupted or destroyed for all species resulting in the overall declining health of the natural environment. Changes in ecosystems and biodiversity translate to increased scarcity of agricultural, herbal, and other natural resources, as well as other unintended consequences affecting human health.

Invasive species are a leading cause of population decline and extinction in animals. BTS have been implicated in the precipitous decline in native forest birds and the modern extinction of at least 10 species on Guam. The loss of pollinating birds and fruit bat prevent forested communities from regeneration. An adverse impact includes the decline in native and endemic species of plants and trees.

The CRB is probably the most visually impactful of any arrival of invasive species to the island of Guam to date. Since the time of the CRB’s detection in 2007, nearly all of the coconut trees at the Governor Joseph Flores Ypao Beach Park and other public beaches along Tumon Bay have been lost. Only those found on private hotel and resort properties remain standing and the rest of the island’s

coconut palm population remain at risk. This devastation negatively impacts the island’s population that rely on the tree for its fruit, sap, and leaves.

Guam’s native Cycas micronesica, or fadang, was once in

noticeable abundance until 2003 when it was decimated by

a new invasive insect pest broadly referred to as the Asian

Cycad scale. The Cycad scale embeds itself deep within the

leaves and crevices of the fadang and latches on to capture

the plant’s juices. Nearly 90% of the fadang has been deci-

mated prompting its protection by law. The fadang has

served as a cultural resource for the Chamorros for many

years and have a significant role to biodiversity in forested

areas. The absence of the fadang in the forested areas have

adverse effects to their communities.
The Greater Banded Hornet (GBH), or Vespa tropica, is one of the most recent new detections of invasive wasp in

2016. Two colonies were detected, one in upper Tumon and another in Yoña, after Univer-

sity of Guam entomologists received reports of very painful

stings. The GBH is large and aggressive compared to honey bees

and other species of wasps. They raid other nests to bring larvae

back to feed their own larvae. Though those colonies have been

destroyed, the Council continues to monitor for any reports.

The Little Fire Ant (LFA), or Wasmannia auropunctata, is listed by the Global Invasive Species Database as one of the top 100 worst invasive species worldwide and is considered the greatest ant threat to the Pacific Region. They deliver a painful sting causing an extremely itchy rash. If left uncontrolled, it leaves the human population vulnerable to stings, poses unintended consequences when it competes for habitats with native species, and is a significant threat to agriculture.

Vespa tropica, or the Greater Banded Hornet (GBH), is one of the most recent new detections of invasive wasp. INSET: An incident involving the Guam Fire Department demonstrates the harmful stings by the GBH.

Economic Costs ___________________________________________________________
Monitoring, control, and eradication of invasive species takes expertise, time, and a tremendous amount of resources and money. The Council will develop its own economic assessments on costs related to combating invasive species and explore opportunities for funding.
According to a study conducted in 1999 on Economic Impacts of Invasive Species to Wildlife Services’ Cooperators, it is estimated that the cost of BTS-related power outages exceeded

2017-2019 Interim Guam Invasive Species Management Plan

07

$1 million dollars per year while the cost to treat snake-bites was around $25,000. However, the economic losses still pale in comparison to the loss of native birds and the continued threat to existing species on Guam.
The BTS has long been associated with Guam. Many Guamanians traveling abroad are commonly asked about the abundance of the BTS on island and how Guam’s citizens cope. An indirect impact of this stigma is that it deters visitors from choosing Guam as a tourist destination or as a duty station by military personnel. Guam relies on tourism and military spending and the Council is cognizant of the implications in lost revenues for the island. Coconut trees that survive CRB infestation take months to regrow full crowns of healthy leaves. Much of the island’s one million tourists are unsatisfied to see bald palm trees on their tropical island vacation.
Guam is enjoying a recent renaissance of cottage-, small-, and commercial-scale plant and poultry farming. This activity positively addresses food security but presents challenges to detect and control/eradicate new invasive species, and highlights capacity and capability gaps of responsible local agencies, to include weak inspection policies, inefficient communication between inspecting agencies, and lack of funding. Researchers and scientists require adequate funding to search and test biocontrols that do not pose adverse impacts to the environment.

Thick algal mats, like the one pictured here, can smother corals and have long-lasting impacts on the ecosystem.

The GBH is large and aggressive compared to honey bees and other species of wasps.

Summary
Island ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the destructive power of invasive pests. The unimpeded spread of invasive species is of the greatest threat to Guam’s economy, natural environment, and the health and lifestyle of its people. Invasive pests can cause millions of dollars in crop losses, the extinction of native species, the destruction of native forests and habitats, and the spread of diseases. Invasive species are ultimately organisms that causes decreases in ecosystem function. Invasive species also rarely arrive by themselves and common introductions involve human intervention. Overall more support and funding is needed for invasive species work throughout Guam.

2017-2019 Interim Guam Invasive Species Management Plan

08

The goals and strategies outlined in this plan are intended to move forward on priority issues through the mission and responsibilities of the GISC. They were developed in a series of stakeholder workshops and meetings to get guidance and input on the Council’s unique role to progress invasive species work in Guam. The fight to protect Guam’s terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems continues.
Invasive species is everyone’s responsibility.

III.
GUAM INVASIVE SPECIES COUNCIL MEMBERSHIP & STRUCTURE
Council Membership
The Council membership is composed of the organizational heads, or their designees, from the following:
a) Guam Department of Agriculture (DOAG) b) Guam Customs and Quarantine Agency (CQA) c) A.B Won Pat International Airport Authority d) Jose D. Leon Guerrero Port Authority of Guam (PAG) e) University of Guam (UOG) f) Guam Department of Parks and Recreation g) Mayors’ Council of Guam h) Northern and Southern Soil and Water Conservation Districts.
Included as non-voting members are representatives from the Bureau of Statistics and Plans (BSP), Homeland Security, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
The Council may invite additional public and private sector members to serve on subcommittees with significant responsibilities concerning invasive species, and may prescribe special procedures for their participation.
The Guam Invasive Species Council Act of 2011 also mandated the Council to review the 2009 Interagency Biosecurity Task Force Work Plan which provides a needed component of a comprehensive biosecurity system that has seamless coverage and enforcement, to achieve a level of protection necessary to maintain or enhance the valuable natural resources of Guam. In 2016, the DOAG and CQA signed the Interagency Biosecurity Work

2017-2019 Interim Guam Invasive Species Management Plan

09

Plan (IBW), outlining the commitments, duties, roles, and responsibilities between both parties in the interest of collectively combating invasive species. The purpose of the agreement is to establish a heightened agricultural biosecurity effort geared towards enhancing the ability of both CQA and DOAG to provide Guam with a more effective biosecurity protection program; and to improve Guam’s protection of dangerous or invasive species and diseases, and to effectively prevent, respond, contain and eradicate agricultural threats, whenever necessary, that may infiltrate the biosecurity net. The IBW reinforces a joint effort by both agencies to cooperatively lead GISC in developing strategies and improving upon existing efforts to the threat of IS. The IBW also establishes a seamless connection between port of entry inspections, exotic pest surveys, and the ability to respond to a disease or pest introduction.
Biosecurity Division And Support Staff
To support GISC policies, the Act also established a Biosecurity Division within the DOAG as the lead local government agency with a purpose to provide for the inspection, quarantine, and eradication of invasive species contained in any freight, including, but not limited to, marine commercial container shipments in efforts to address invasive species coming to, and already present in, Guam.
The law also calls for the establishment of the Guam Invasive Species Inspection Fee to be collected by freight customers and deposited into a separate account. The purpose of the fee was to fund the Biosecurity Division, its support staff, and for the Council to hire a Territorial Invasive Species Coordinator (TISC) who will serve as the Council’s Secretary to carry out the communications and coordination as directed by the Council. Implementation of the fee began in July 2015 so vacancies did not open up until the passage of Bill 223-33 by the Guam Legislature (I Liheslaturan Guåhan). The bill was signed into law as P.L. 33-130 in March 2016 and appropriated the revenues from the Guam Invasive Species Inspection Fee to fund vacant positions within the Biosecurity Division as well as operational expenses of the program.
In a GISC meeting held in February 2016, following the passage of Bill 223-33, members proposed recruitment for the following:
a) Entomologist b) Botanist c) Plant pathologist d) Biosecurity officers e) Administrative support staff
The entomologist position was filled shortly thereafter. Active recruitment for the remaining positions is ongoing.

IV.
2017-2019 GOALS & STRATEGIES
The Guam Invasive Species Council Act of 2011 outlines the statutory responsibilities of the Council:
a) Create a mission statement on invasive species for Guam.** b) Develop a Guam Invasive Species Management Plan (GISMP).* c) Act as the lead entity for Guam to include local regional, national and
international invasive species efforts.* d) Provide annual reports on the progress made in achieving the objectives of
the GISMP to I Liheslaturan Guåhan and I Maga’låhen Guåhan. e) Coordinate and promote Guam’s position with respect to federal issues
concerning invasive species in Guam.* f) Identify and record all invasive species present in Guam.* (See Appendix C) g) Identify all needed resources for the purpose of working on invasive species
prevention, suppression, and eradication.* h) Advise I Liheslaturan Guåhan and I Maga’låhen Guåhan on budgetary and other
issues concerning invasive species. i) Review the structure of fines and penalties to ensure maximum deterrence
for invasive species-related crimes. j) Make appropriate recommendations for legislation to improve the manage-
ment of invasive species programs and policies. k) Update the Interagency Biosecurity Task Force Work Plan.** l) Perform all functions necessary to effectuate the mission of the Council.
* in-progress ** final to date
The goals presented in the next section are identified by the Council as preliminary steps in enhancing and strengthening its capabilities to effectively carry out its mission and responsibilities.

2017-2019 Interim Guam Invasive Species Management Plan

11

Goal 1 Territorial Invasive Species Coordinator__________________________________
The GISC will continue to pursue the recruitment of a Territorial Invasive Species Coordinator (TISC) and all necessary personnel to include but not limited to those listed in the Support Staff section of this plan.
The recruitment of a TISC is still in the process of being established as a classified position in the civil service program. The DOAG Biosecurity Division will recruit a Program Coordinator IV in the interim until a TISC has been established and recruited.
Strategies • Define staffing patterns/ funding capabilities for TISC and personnel. • Identify potential candidates for recruitment.
Evaluation Measures • Strong public, regional, and global presence and position of the Council. • Clear communications and coordination between the Council and branches of government, stakeholders, and community. • Turnaround time for completion of deliverable actions carried out by the Council.
Goal 2 Prevention_________________________________________________________________
Prevention is the most cost effective strategy for combating invasive species. In 2010, DOAG’s Division of Aquatic and Wildlife Resources reported at least 73 non-native organisms found only at the Jose D. Leon Guerrero Port which gave strong implications of pathways via boat traffic. Reprioritizing inspection services for all vessels, goods, and commodities arriving into Guam is critical for the Council to increase prevention measures.
Strategies • Coordinate with I Liheslaturan Guåhan to craft policy and identify funding sources that would establish a fully-contained animal and plant inspection facility at the PAG. • Ensure comprehensive biosecurity inspections occur prior to arriving in Guam. • Institute a green waste response plan specifically to reducing micropiles of green debris around the island.
Evaluation Measures • Regional and global recognition and compliance of Guam’s biosecurity controls. • Rapid response and containment of new detections at ports of entry. • Decreased rate and volume of pest detections.

2017-2019 Interim Guam Invasive Species Management Plan

12

Goal 3 Deterrence_________________________________________________________________
Enforcement of regulations will deter violations and further introduction of invasive species via human intervention.
Strategies • Establish working group to coordinate with I Liheslaturan Guåhan in crafting policy that intends to define penalties and fines for those found in violation of contributing to the introduction of invasive species to Guam.
Evaluation Measures • Rate and volume of detections at known pathways. • Shift in attitudes regarding public approach to combating invasive species. • Lean public reporting of suspected violators.
Goal 4 Educational Outreach_____________________________________________________
Educational outreach programs encourage advocacy in protecting Guam from invasive species. The Council’s goal is to engage visitors and the island community to participate as it is an important component to invasive species management on Guam.
Strategies • Establish working group to build and promote campaigns that increase public awareness and participation in invasive species management. • Involve the Guam Department of Education and all learning institutions in observing the National Invasive Species Awareness Week. Activities may include school decorating contests, poster/essay contests, and mural contests, geared toward biosecurity and native habitat restoration. • Coordinate and conduct workshops, conferences, community conversations, and other public forums for sharing of information relative to invasive species on Guam. • Integrate pest reporting systems between agencies and be made available for public reporting procedures.
Evaluation Measures • Increased public knowledge of invasive species. • Changes in rate and volume of reported detections.

2017-2019 Interim Guam Invasive Species Management Plan

13

Goal 5 Rapid Response Plan______________________________________________________
A rapid response plan will detail mobilization and protocol of all stakeholders and agencies responding to new detections of invasive species.
Strategies • The 2005 Draft Emergency Response Plan will be reviewed and updated for use as the Council’s Rapid Response Plan (RRP).
Evaluation Measures • Clear identification of work flow at the interagency level, leadership roles, and SOP tasks. • Early detection categorization on newly discovered invasive species. • Immediate fortifying of pathways of early detections.
V.
OTHER STRATEGIC GOALS
Goal A Incorporate With RBP_____________________________________________________
Incorporate Guam priorities and efforts into the Regional Biosecurity Plan.
Goal B Establish Formal Recognition_____________________________________________
Establish formal representation at the federal (NISC, DoD) and regional levels (Regional Invasive Species Council, SPC).
Goal C Funding Sources ___________________________________________________________
Explore additional local, federal, and grant funding sources for the continued support of existing programs and the development of new programs surrounding the detection, control, monitoring, and eradication/interdiction of invasive species on Guam.

Definitions
Aquatic ecosystems are ecosystems in a body of water. Two main types of aquatic ecosystems are marine and freshwater ecosystems.
Alien invasive species are plants, animals, pathogens, and other organisms that are non-native to an ecosystem, and which may cause economic and environmental harm or adversely affect human health.
Alien species means, with respect to a particular ecosystem, any species, including its seeds, eggs, spores, or other biological material capable of propagating that species, that is not native to that ecosystem.
Biocontrol is a method of controlling pests such as insects, mites, weeds, and plant diseases using other organisms.
Biodiversity is the variety of life in the world or in a particular habitat or ecosystem. Biosecurity are the procedures intended to protect humans or animals against disease or harmful biological
agents. Control means, as appropriate, eradicating, suppressing, reducing, or managing invasive species popula-
tions, preventing spread of invasive species from areas where they are present, and taking steps such as restoration of native species and habitats to reduce the effects of invasive species and to prevent further invasions. Detection or Early Detection, is a process of detecting, reporting and verifying the presence of non-native species before a population becomes established or spreads that eradication is no longer feasible. Ecosystem means the complex of a community of organisms and its environment.

2017-2019 Interim Guam Invasive Species Management Plan

17

Endemic species are plants and animals that exist only in one geographic region. Islands are likely to have a variety of endemic species because of their separation from larger land masses.
Eradication means the removal or extirpation of invasive species.
Extirpation means the removal, endangerment, or extinction of many of Guam’s native birds.
Feral refers to the animals in the wild that are descended from domestic animals.
Infestation is the state of being invaded or overrun by pests or parasites.
Intentional release refers to plants and animals transferred from other regions and are set free in the wild.
Interim Management Plan is an evolving document that discusses the coordinated effort between government officials, organizations, and community stakeholders in the management of Guam’s biosecurity and invasive species programs.
Introduction means the intentional or unintentional escape, release, dissemination, or placement of a species into an ecosystem as a result of human activity.
Invasive species means an alien species whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health.
Marine ecosystems refers to salt marshes, intertidal zones, estuaries, lagoons, mangroves, coral reefs, the deep sea, and the sea floor.
Monitoring means continued assessment of existing invasive species and their locations and their impacts on the economy, the environment, and human health.
Native species means, with respect to a particular ecosystem, a species that, other than as a result of an introduction, historically occurred or currently occurs in that ecosystem.
Pathogens means bacterium, fungi, virus, or other microorganism that can cause disease.
Pathways are the means by which invasive species are moved, intentionally or unintentionally, in new areas.
Pests are unwanted plants or animals that are detrimental to human health, agriculture, livestock, and ecosystems.
Pollinating birds refers to the important role of Guam’s native birds in the transfer and growth of many native plants.
Prevention means the activities taken to prevent the further introduction of invasive species.
Reforestation means the process of replanting an area with trees.
Regeneration the succession of new plants and animals in an area
Species means a group of organisms all of which have a high degree of physical and genetic similarity, generally interbreed only among themselves, and show persistent differences from members of allied groups of organisms.
Stakeholder means, but is not limited to, Federal, State, Territorial, tribal, and local government agencies, academic institutions, the scientific community, non-governmental entities including environmental, agricultural, and conservation organizations, trade groups, commercial interests, and private landowners.
Subsistence economy is a non-monetary economy which relies on natural resources to provide basic needs through hunting, gathering, and subsistence agriculture.
Terrestrial ecosystems is ecosystem found only on landforms and includes all organisms.
Ungulates refers to a diverse group of primarily large mammals. On Guam, feral ungulates are cattle, carabao, deer, and swine.

Brown Treesnake Strategic Plan
Brown Treesnake Technical Working Group
Final Draft

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Shortly after World War II, what was most likely a single pregnant female brown treesnake (BTS) was inadvertently transported from Manus Island, Papua New Guinea to Guam in military cargo. Working collaboratively, managers and scientists have succeeded in preventing the BTS from establishing in areas outside of Guam. On Guam, the snake spread across the island causing widespread impacts at multiple levels. Ecologically, the BTS caused the extinction or extirpation of many native and endemic species of birds and lizards. The loss of these animals has caused, and continues to cause, cascading ecological effects on the island’s native plants and animals. For example, the loss of pollinating bird and fruit bat species is negatively affecting forest regeneration and future forest structure on Guam.
The BTS also has socioeconomic and human health effects. Power outages caused by the BTS are common, some lasting up to 12 hours and can number almost 200 per year. The annual cost of these snake-related outages has been estimated at $4.5M. Bites from the venomous BTS are rarely fatal, but typically cause pain and distress, especially to children, sending many to the hospital.
The discovery in the mid-80s that the BTS was responsible for the devastation of Guam’s avifauna and frequent power outages prompted management responses from a range of federal, state, and territorial agencies. Several pieces of federal legislation and interagency agreements have been instrumental in providing a regulatory framework in which the BTS is managed. This framework includes the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the Memorandum of Agreement on Control of the Brown Tree Snake in 1993, and the Executive Order 13112, Invasive Species in 1999. The U.S. Congress formally recognized the threat the BTS posed to the country as part of the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 and later passed the Brown Tree Snake Control and Eradication Act of 2004. The aforementioned legislation established the Brown Treesnake Technical Working Group (BTS TWG) to ensure that “efforts concerning the brown treesnake are coordinated, effective, complementary, and cost-effective.” The BTS TWG has three overarching long-term goals:
1. Preventing the escape of the BTS from Guam to other locations; 2. Suppressing and controlling BTS numbers to reduce their impact on the island of Guam and to
restore the island’s ecosystem; 3. Eradicating the BTS from Guam.
To achieve the long-term goals outlined above, it is necessary to pursue several objectives that can be achieved on a shorter (5-year) time scale:
• Interdiction o Prevent the escape of the BTS from Guam – The BTS TWG has a “zero tolerance” policy for snakes dispersing off and establishing outside of Guam. A 100-percent inspection rate is the objective. Working collaboratively, managers, and scientists have succeeded in preventing the BTS from establishing in areas outside of Guam. o Develop and implement a system of quality assessment (QA) for interdiction-related programs – Performance varies considerably across BTS programs, ranging from very
ii

high operational standards to marginal. A QA system would provide a needed set of standards to evaluate program performance and mechanisms to achieve improvement when a program is performing sub-optimally. • Suppress BTS populations at a landscape level (a minimum of 2,500 acres) and eradicate at a minimum of a 250 acre scale – To initiate the process of restoring native species on Guam, BTS (and other predators) must be eradicated or severely suppressed at biologically meaningful scales. • Restore native species on Guam – Returning native species to Guam that have been extirpated by the BTS is a long-standing goal of the BTS TWG. Flightless native species, such as Guam rails or some lizard species, will be the probable first choices for restoration on Guam. • Ensure BTS activities do not reduce military readiness or impede the commercial transportation sector – Interdiction activities have the potential to impact military readiness or commercial transportation activities; however, it is the goal of the BTS TWG to conduct interdiction efforts as efficiently as possible to minimize the impact of interdiction efforts on military and civilian activities.
Interdiction on Guam, and in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and Hawaii, is the principal means of realizing the primary goal of preventing the spread of the BTS from Guam to other locations. Rapid Response Teams (RRT), administered by U.S. Geological Survey, are deployed as a backup when a BTS is reported outside of Guam. Research on BTS biology and control techniques supports interdiction efforts. Outreach plays a critical role in preventing the dispersal of the BTS from Guam as well, educating the general public and personnel dealing with cargo and conveyances outbound from Guam (i.e., “high-risk cargo”). Achieving the BTS TWG’s second goal of protecting Guam’s human interests and aiding in the restoration of its endangered wildlife is achieved by strategically suppressing local snake populations, in combination with captive rearing and the eventual release of native birds. The third goal of the BTS TWG, eradication of the BTS from Guam is currently beyond reach, but it has the potential to be realized.
For almost 30 years, BTS management, research, and coordination efforts have been tested and refined. Methods to achieve landscape-scale suppression of BTS populations show great promise and interdiction procedures have progressed to the point where United States Department of Agriculture Animal Plant Health Inspection Service - Wildlife Services inspection rates of cargo and flights departing Guam are almost 100%. It has been two decades since a live BTS has been detected in Hawaii and prior to a capture of a BTS at the sea port on Rota in 2014, it had been five years since one was reported in the CNMI. Despite the major advances in the ability to manage the BTS, there exist a range of needs and issues that must be addressed to achieve programmatic efficacy.
Current snake management strategies have been successful in decreasing, but not eliminating, the probability of snakes becoming established on other islands and positioning managers for restoration of native species. To increase the efficacy of these programs, broaden the scope of control efforts, and develop new tools, additional work is required to understand the effect of control and interdiction
iii

strategies on snake populations, snake behavior, and ecosystems. Overall, more research needs to be performed to understand and predict the response of BTS populations to control strategies and tools.
To more effectively and efficiently build on the research successes of the past, the BTS TWG chartered the BTS Research Committee (BTS RC) in 2012. The primary goal of the BTS RC is to develop strategic long-term plans and short-term priorities for advancing research on the BTS, focusing on developing the biological knowledge and technical ability required to meet the management goals of the BTS TWG. Membership on the BTS RC is drawn from the BTS TWG, as well as subject matter experts from academic institutions and the scientific community. Despite the varied missions and priorities of the involved organizations, it rapidly became apparent to all BTS RC members that although BTS research has been remarkably successful, a critical historical weakness remains in place: the lack of predictable base funding for the primary agencies responsible for BTS research. Conducting BTS research and methods development with funds solely from intermittent grants and contracts impacts programs and efficiency in several ways:
1. Staffing continuity – Research and methods development projects based on annual funding often results in a cyclic process of hiring personnel for a single project, investing in training and orienting the employee, then releasing the employee at the end of the contract. This process limits the ability to develop program capacity, is inefficient, and costly. Additionally, intermittent funding for BTS projects implies a degree of uncertainty, which can hinder the ability to leverage resources (e.g., staffing) from cooperating agencies.
2. Sub-contracting costs – Sub-contracting some aspects of projects can be useful; however, the inability to hire permanent or semi-permanent staff often results in an over-reliance on subcontractors. This has a tendency to increase project costs since each entity charges overhead and has additional start-up costs.
3. Strategically limited projects – Many of the problems inherent to the pursuit of eradication of the BTS from Guam require multi-phase projects that are based on incremental advancements that are directed by results from the preceding stages. Funding cycles and internal administrative policies limit researcher’s ability to plan and propose planning and proposing multi-year projects. The uncertainty of receiving funds from year-to-year constraints researchers into conceptualizing and designing projects that can be accomplished in a single funding cycle.
Reaching the current stage of interdiction, research, and restoration has required $100M in total funding since 1987, with support in recent years exceeding $7M annually. Overall, DOI has provided the majority of the funding, contributing $51.5M, and was the primary department supporting the BTS TWG during the first seven years. Sustained support from DoD began in 1994, coinciding with WS’s entry into the BTS TWG. Overall, DoD has provided $39.7M in funding. Moving to the next level, where the BTS can be suppressed across hundreds to thousands of acres will require continued support, but more importantly long-term stable funding is essential to conduct consistent research to develop improved BTS control tools, and to understand the response of BTS populations to suppression and the ecological
iv

interaction of the BTS and associated species. Maintaining effective interdiction efforts and funding research at viable levels will require substantial financial support in the near term. However, the alternatives carry much greater costs. A decrease in financial support and concomitant reduction in interdiction would probably result in the BTS invading another area, most likely Saipan or Hawaii. If the BTS was to become established in Hawaii, the impact to its economy is estimated to exceed $1B annually. Simply continuing the status quo will carry costs into perpetuity, with the persistent threat of the BTS dispersing off of Guam. The only viable long-term strategy is to continue to maintain and improve interdiction, while simultaneously supporting research that will enable large-scale suppression of BTS populations, which will ultimately reduce the risk of off-island dispersal and allow for the restoration of Guam’s native vertebrate species. The intent of this Plan is: 1) to provide an overview of the history and achievements of the BTS TWG; 2) to present the current status of BTS-related activities; 3) to provide an overview of the short-term (5year) BTS management-related research themes and directions; 4) to document areas where improvements in the BTS TWG are needed and achievable; 5) to provide an overview of past BTS funding; and 6) and to detail the current and short-term funding needs under varying funding events.
Note: The Brown Tree Snake Control and Eradication Act of 2004 was titled using "Tree Snake" as two words. This document will follow this convention when referring to the Act itself, documents referencing the Act, and when referring to entities or documents that use “Tree Snake” in the title. However, the more scientifically accepted single word "treesnake" will be used throughout the remainder of this document.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 1.1 BACKGROUND As a U.S. territory, the island of Guam is of regional importance to the U.S. It serves as a critical hub for civilian transportation and the Department of Defense (DoD) movement in the Pacific region and is poised to take on an even greater role relative to the aforementioned issues in the near future. Guam’s strategic location in the western Pacific has resulted in an increasing volume of military and civilian traffic from Asia and North America intersecting on this 209 square mile island. This convergence of human activities, inadequate quarantine regulations, and an insular system vulnerable to accidental introductions, has created an environment ideally suited for species to invade, establish, and subsequently be introduced into the U.S. or other countries. Over 1,000 species of introduced animals and plants are likely established on Guam, with dozens severely impacting the island’s natural systems (Aubrey Moore, University of Guam, pers. comm.). Arguably, the most damaging alien invader to establish on Guam thus far is the brown treesnake (BTS; Boiga irregularis).

Shortly after World War II, what was most likely a single pregnant female BTS was inadvertently transported from Manus Island, Papua New Guinea to Guam in military cargo (Figure 1; Rawlings 1995, Rodda et al. 1992). Encountering few predators, competitors, or pathogens, and a super-abundance of prey, the BTS spread across the entire island in approximately 20 years. At its peak in the 1980s, the snake population was estimated at two million and in favorable habitats reached densities in excess of 100 snakes / acre (Rodda & Savidge 2007). Elsewhere, densities of large non-aggregated snakes average 5 / ha (Parker & Plummer 1987). Despite having been introduced to a single island, the BTS serves as the textbook example of the ecological havoc arising from invasive species introductions and is among the most damaging invasive species (Lowe et al. 2000). To date, the BTS is not known to have escaped from Guam to successfully invade and establish in another area. But, the above factors that allowed the BTS and other alien species to invade Guam continue to pose a threat for transporting the snake to other vulnerable islands and the U.S. 1.2 BIOLOGY & LIFE HISTORY OF THE BROWN TREESNAKE The BTS is native to the area encompassing coastal northern and eastern Australia, the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, and Sulawesi (Fritts 1988). These snakes are generally associated with humid, forested habitats and are primarily tree dwelling, but will travel and hunt on the ground (Rodda and Savidge 2007). They have an extraordinarily slender body, giving the appearance of an outsized head. They average four ft. in length, but can grow to over 10 ft. (Rodda et al. 1999b). Though irregular in coloration, the BTS on Guam generally are a brownish olive green, with shadowlike markings (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Brown treesnake and mourning gecko (photo B. Lardner, USGS).
They have elliptical eyes, characteristic of their nocturnal behavior. The BTS eats a wide variety of animals, including frogs, lizards, birds, and small mammals (Savidge 1988, Greene 1989, Shine 1991). Younger, smaller snakes (< 2.5 ft.) primarily prey on lizards (e.g., geckos); however, as snakes age and increase in size, prey preference shifts to birds and mammals (Savidge 1988; Lardner et al. 2009). The BTS produces venom that usually causes a mild reaction in humans, but is toxic to lizards and birds (Weinstein et al. 1991, 1993; Mackessy et al. 2006).

1.3 ECOLOGICAL, SOCIOECONOMIC, AND HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS OF THE BROWN TREESNAKE
Since their establishment on Guam, the BTS has caused many problems. First and foremost, snakes have had a devastating effect on the island’s terrestrial fauna (Appendix A). Eleven native birds were extirpated from Guam by the BTS (Figure 3), but survive on other islands (Wiles et al. 2003, Wiles 2005). One species, the Guam flycatcher (Myiagra freycineti) went extinct in 1984 (Wiles et al. 2003). The endemic Guam rail (Gallirallus owstoni) and Micronesian kingfisher (Todiramphus cinnamominus; Taylor 2012), went extinct in the wild, but captive populations were established before these birds disappeared from Guam. Translocated populations of rails now occur on the neighboring Cocos Island and Rota, the southernmost island of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI; DAWR 2001). The BTS has also caused the near extirpation or severe decline of another four species of birds (Wiles et al. 2003). Though less well known and less dramatic than the impact to Guam’s birds, the extirpation or decline of several species of native lizards is attributable to the BTS (Rodda and Fritts 1992). Geckos, because of their nocturnal habits, have been affected the most, with one species extirpated and four severely reduced in number (Rodda and Fritts 1992). The BTS is also implicated in the loss or decline of three species of skink, but other introduced species may have played a role. Predation from the BTS is also linked to extinction of one fruit bat and the near extinction of an insectivorous bat, although other factors contributed to the declines (Wiles 1987, 2005). This loss of native vertebrates caused cascading ecological consequences for Guam’s forests (Mortensen et al. 2008). The majority of the birds extirpated by the BTS were insectivorous and their absence likely contributed to an explosion of spiders and an altered invertebrate community (Rogers et al. 2012). Some of the lost birds were nectar- and fruiteaters, as were the fruit bats. The removal of these pollinators and seed dispersers from the ecosystem will likely affect forest regeneration (Cox et al. 1991; Fujita and Tuttle 1991; Corlett 1998).
In addition to the ecological consequences, the BTS has had socioeconomic and human health impacts on Guam. The BTS will routinely climb guy-wires accessing electrical distribution and transmission lines. This can cause ground faults or short circuits resulting in power outages of varying severity and duration, including island-wide blackouts lasting up to 12 hours (Fritts 2002). From 1978 to 1997, more than 1600 snake-related outages occurred, averaging around 85 per year. In 2002, there were almost 200 BTScaused outages and another 195 from March 2003 to March 2004 (Fritts 2002; Shwiff et al. 2010). A single island-wide outage in 1988 cost more than $3M and annually these power failures, brownouts, and power surges are estimated to cost $4.5M in lost power generating revenue, damaged equipment, and interrupted island functions (e.g., medical services, air transportation, and commerce; Fritts 2002). These figures exclude costs experienced by individuals, such as damaged appliances or the purchase of personal generators (Fritts 2002).
Although not normally life threatening to humans, a BTS bite victims frequently suffer pain, discoloration, and swelling (Fritts et al. 1994). Infants and small children may be slightly more

susceptible to being bitten than other age groups and because of their small body size, they generally experience greater distress from envenomation than larger bite victims (Fritts and McCoid 1999). More recent data (1998-2004) indicate that individuals of all ages are equally likely to be bitten by a BTS (Shwiff 2010). The presence of the BTS on Guam and the zero tolerance policy of no snakes dispersing off island add a layer of complexity to civilian and military activities that involve the movement of people and cargo off island (Figure 4). To prevent the transport of the BTS from Guam, and repeating the devastation elsewhere, it is imperative that all vehicles, equipment, and cargo, as well as personal goods are subject to current BTS inspection and quarantine procedures, which may significantly impact civilian and military operations in cost, time, and mission accomplishment. These efforts require improved coordination between BTS TWG partners (See Section 2.2).
Figure 4. A map of the territory of Guam showing military and civilian air and seaports. Locations of brown treesnake-related management activities are also shown.
1.4 POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF FAILED INTERDICTION The threat of transporting a BTS to one of the many destinations en route from Guam is a serious concern. As noted above, a single pregnant snake is sufficient to start a population and the BTS is known
5

to have survived in cargo being shipped from Guam to the continental U.S. for seven months. From Guam, the BTS has been transported alive across the globe to Spain, Alaska, Texas, Oklahoma, and Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean (Stanford and Rodda 2007). Between 1978 and 2009, approximately 120 snakes have been reported outside of Guam. The majority of those sightings were in the CNMI (93) and on Oahu (10). It should be noted that the credibility of many of these sightings is in doubt. Fortunately, improved interdiction efforts have reduced the risk of snakes hitchhiking to the CNMI and Hawaii from Guam. However, DoD growth in the Marianas (e.g., the proposed relocation of U.S. Marine Corps personnel and assets from Okinawa to Guam) may increase activity at Guam’s air and seaports in the near future. Both military and civilian cargo and conveyances are expected to increase in volume and frequency. From an ecological perspective, the CNMI, Hawaii, and other Pacific islands are extremely vulnerable to invasion by the BTS. The factors that permitted the BTS to invade and overrun Guam exist on the larger islands in the CNMI (Figure 5; Perry and Vice 2009). Saipan, for example has diverse and highly abundant prey, such as rodents, lizards, and birds, and a climate similar to Guam. If the BTS became established on Saipan, the island’s 11 native forest birds would likely suffer the same fate as those on Guam.
Figure 5. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, with the three main islands and their respective air and seaports (insets).

Hawaii and the Marianas differ in many perspectives, yet the Hawaiian archipelago possesses environmental factors (e.g., abundant native and introduced vertebrate prey and equable climate) similar to the Marianas making it equally susceptible to the impacts from an invasion of the BTS. Oahu is the Hawaiian island most at risk of invasion of the BTS from Guam (Figure 6). If established on Oahu, the BTS would endanger many of the archipelago’s 65 native species of birds. This would likely trigger monumental conservation efforts and carry with it monetary costs to prevent the extinction of these birds threatened by the BTS. Conservation measures could include the establishment of captive rearing facilities for a wide range of endemic birds and implementation of landscape scale snake suppression. For perspective, captive-rearing of four Hawaiian birds by federal and state agencies averages about $1.1M per year (Jay Nelson, USFWS – PIFWO pers. comm.).
Figure 6. The main Hawaiian Islands showing air and seaports. The majority of the traffic originating in Guam arrives on Oahu (inset).
The presence of the BTS on Oahu would further compound interdiction efforts. Instead of having a single island in the Pacific (Guam), which requires an average of $4.79M annually (2009 – 2012) for BTS interdiction, there would be multiple foci. Moreover, Oahu as the transportation hub in the Pacific would require an order of magnitude greater expenditure of money and effort in an attempt to contain the BTS. If the BTS establish on Oahu, its population is estimated to reach 7.5 million snakes on the
7

island (Burnett et al. 2008). The associated economic losses from power outages and medical costs from snake bites could reach $761M annually (Shwiff et al. 2010). Tourism could be impacted as well. If the BTS invade all of Hawaii, estimated annual costs from lost visitor days, ranged from $138M to almost $1.4B. Focus has been on islands in the Pacific Region, however, it is worth noting that areas of the continental U.S. are also at risk of a BTS invasion. Climate matching models indicate that many areas in the Southern U.S. may be suitable for the BTS (Figure 7; Rodda et al. 2007a). South Florida exemplifies this, with almost fifty-three species of alien reptiles (Krysko et al. 2011), which along with Hawaii and the Mariana Archipelago are among the world’s leading sites for the number of alien reptile species (Kraus 2009). An amenable climate is one factor facilitating the invasion of alien reptiles, abundant native and non-native prey is another. Burmese pythons (Python molurus) provide a cautionary parallel to Guam’s situation, having rapidly expanded across the Everglades, they are causing the decline of native species (Reed and Rodda 2009, Krysko et al. 2011, Dorcas et al. 2012).
Suitable Too hot Too dry Too cold

Diligence and determination on the part of BTS TWG partners has been instrumental in preventing the BTS from invading another area. Good fortune has contributed as well: the BTS has failed to establish a population on the occasions when they have escaped Guam. Ultimately, safeguarding the flora and fauna, and the human inhabitants of the CNMI, Hawaii, and elsewhere from the impacts of the BTS will require dedicated long-term funding and regulatory authority mandating inspections of all cargo and conveyances departing Guam to prevent their dispersal off Guam. The alternative is the eventual arrival of a pregnant or inseminated BTS, another Guam, and another ecological disaster.

2.0 BROWN TREESNAKE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP
2.1 BACKGROUND
The Brown Treesnake (BTS) Technical Working Group (formerly the Brown Tree Snake Control Committee) was established in 1993 by the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force under the authority of section 1209 of the 1990 Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act and the 1993 Memorandum of Agreement for Control and Eradication of the Brown Tree Snake (see “Regulatory Timeline” below). As defined in the Brown Tree Snake Control and Eradication Act of 2004, the purpose of BTS Technical Working Group (hereafter BTS TWG) is to ensure that “efforts concerning the brown treesnake are coordinated, effective, complementary, and cost-effective.” The BTS TWG is formally comprised of federal, state, and territorial partner agencies, with periodic informal participation by nongovernmental organizations. While these entities collaborate to meet the goals of the BTS TWG, it should be recognized that the respective missions of the individual partners are diverse. Below is a list of the partners and a description of their roles in the TWG.

2.3 HISTORY & ACHIEVEMENTS

The discovery in the mid-80s that the BTS was responsible for the devastation of Guam’s native birds posed a unique problem. The ecology of invasive species at this time was in its infancy and what was known about controlling and eradicating introduced vertebrates centered on mammals. Although herpetologists had studied snakes for decades, no methods existed for managing snake populations at any meaningful scale. Additionally, there was a lack of basic biological information on the BTS and this type of snake in general. Overcoming these two deficiencies was an initial step in the almost 30 years of BTS management. This large-scale conservation effort has been dedicated to understanding the life history, behavior, and ecology of the BTS, and applying this knowledge to the development of techniques to prevent the off-island transport of the snakes and to protecting the remaining native fauna on Guam. Table 1 summarizes some of the notable achievements of the BTS TWG. It should be emphasized that accomplishments in the table are assigned to a single lead entity, but most are the result of collaboration between agencies.

2. 4 REGULATORY TIMELINE

Meeting the objectives of the BTS TWG has been aided by more than 20 pieces of legislation, regulations, and agreements. Federal, state and territorial agencies are among the entities directly covered by these policy documents. The earliest originate from 1934 and directly or indirectly permit agencies to implement procedures to prevent the spread of invasive species, including the BTS. Below is a synopsis of the major directives important to the BTS TWG. The entire list is provided in Appendix C.

14

• 1973 – Endangered Species Act (ESA). Established to protect and recover imperiled species and the ecosystems upon which they depend. Although the ESA has no direct role in the management of the BTS, it is currently the principal regulatory mechanism preventing the introduction of the BTS outside of Guam. Because the BTS is a threat to the recovery of listed species and have the potential to create additional listed species, the ESA can be used as legal mechanism to support BTS-related interdiction or recovery efforts. Each federal agency is to ensure that any action they authorize, fund, or carry out is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species and federally-funded programs at the state and local level, such as port improvements, require a Section 7 consultation process.
• 1990 – Non-Indigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act (NANPCA). Established a broad new federal program to prevent the introduction of and to control the spread of introduced aquatic nuisance species and the brown treesnake. The Act also established the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force (ANSTF).
• 1992 – Amendment to Lacey Act (1900). Criminalized the unauthorized importation of species of wild animals, including the BTS, which the Secretary of the Interior prescribes by regulation to be injurious to human beings or to the interests of agriculture, horticulture, forestry, or wildlife, except by permit.
• 1993 – Memorandum of Agreement on Control of the Brown Tree Snake. Established a working relationship between DOI, DoD, USDA, GovGuam, Hawaii, CNMI, DOT, and NISC. In 1996 CNMI added as a participating agency; renewed 1999 adding DOT; renewed 2011 adding National Invasive Species Council (NISC).
• 1996 – National Invasive Species Act (NISA amended and reauthorized NANPCA). Created an interagency task force to direct cooperative efforts to control invasive species, including the BTS. NISA required the task force to develop and implement a comprehensive program to control the BTS, producing the 1996 BTS Control Plan.
• 1999 – Executive Order 13112, Invasive Species. Directed federal agencies to prevent the introduction of invasive species and address their impacts through research, outreach, and restoration. It also directed agencies to not authorize, fund, or carry out actions that are likely to facilitate the introduction or spread of invasive species and established the NISC.
• 2004 – Brown Tree Snake Control and Eradication Act of 2004. Expressed the sense of Congress that there is a need for better coordinated control, interdiction, research, and eradication of the BTS on the part of the U.S. The Brown Tree Snake Control and Eradication Act of 2004 directed the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to provide funds (subject to availability) to support BTS control, interdiction, research, and eradication efforts carried out by DOI and USDA, other federal agencies, states, territorial governments, local governments, and private sector
15

entities. The Brown Tree Snake Control and Eradication Act of 2004 established the BTS Technical Working Group (BTS TWG) to ensure that agency efforts concerning the BTS are coordinated, effective, complementary, and cost-effective.
• 2009 – Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417 [Division A], title III, Section 316, October 14, 2008, 122 Statute 4356). Required that “The Secretary of Defense shall establish a comprehensive program to control and, to the extent practicable, eradicate the brown tree snake population from military facilities in Guam and to ensure that military activities do not contribute to the spread of brown tree snakes.”
2.5 GOALS & OBJECTIVES
Once biologists recognized the devastating effect the BTS was having on Guam’s wildlife (Savidge 1987), they began implementing measures to minimize the snake’s impacts. These efforts included research to understand BTS biology and the control of snakes in specific areas to minimize the risk of off-island dispersal and to protect species threatened by the BTS. Combined, these efforts have grown to comprise the scope of the multi-entity BTS TWG. The BTS TWG has three overarching goals:
1. Preventing the escape of the BTS from Guam to other locations; 2. Suppressing and controlling BTS numbers to reduce their impact on the island of Guam and to
restore the island’s ecosystem; 3. Eradicating the BTS from Guam.
To achieve the long-term goals outlined above, it is necessary to pursue several objectives that can be achieved on a shorter (5-year) time scale.
General Objectives -
• Interdiction o Prevent the escape of the BTS from Guam – The BTS TWG has a “zero tolerance” policy for snakes dispersing off and establishing outside of Guam. It has been two decades since a live BTS has been detected in Hawaii. Prior to a capture of a BTS at the sea port on Rota in 2014, it had been five years since one was reported in the CNMI. This achievement is due to WS’s near 100-percent inspection rate of cargo and flights departing Guam (i.e., “high-risk” cargo). A 100-percent inspection rate is the objective. o Develop and implement a system of quality assessment (QA) for interdiction-related programs – Performance varies considerably across BTS programs, ranging from very high operational standards to marginal. To prevent the dispersal and establishment of the BTS outside of Guam it is critical that all programs involved with interdiction are operating at an optimal level that is cost-effective. A QA system would provide a needed set of standards to evaluate program performance and mechanisms to achieve improvement when a program is performing sub-optimally.
16

• Suppress BTS populations at a landscape level ( a minimum of 2,500 acre) and eradicate at a minimum of a 250 acre scale – To achieve restoration of native species on Guam, the BTS (and other predators) must be eradicated or severely suppressed at biologically meaningful scales. Current efforts using aerial baiting techniques to reduce BTS populations over large areas are showing initial success. Further development and refinement of these control tools, as well as development and assessment of new tools are required to efficaciously suppress or eradicate the BTS at large scales.
• Restore native species on Guam – Returning native species to Guam that have been extirpated by the BTS is a long-standing goal of the BTS TWG. A precursor to achieving native species restoration is developing the capacity to clear large areas of BTS of suitable habitat (see above). The fact that most of the native species under consideration for restoration can fly accentuates the need to create large areas where the BTS is eradicated or suppressed. Flightless native species, such as Guam rails or some lizard species, will be the probable first choices for restoration on Guam.
• Ensure BTS activities do not reduce military readiness or impede the commercial transportation sector – Although it is accepted that BTS inspections are necessary, it is also recognized that interdiction activities may potentially have an effect on military readiness or commercial transportation activities. Therefore, it is the goal of the BTS TWG to conduct interdiction efforts as efficiently as possible to minimize the impact of interdiction efforts on military and civilian activities.
Program-specific Objectives – Below is a list of action items that need to be addressed by the BTS TWG. These items are discussed in more detail throughout this Plan.
• WS o Cost projection – A USDA economist is contracted to conduct an analysis estimating costs of conducting interdiction on Guam in the future under various growth scenarios. A final report will be delivered in 2015. o BTS off-island pathways – As the human population and development increase on Guam, BTS off-island dispersal vectors have the potential to change. WS leadership is tasked with identifying and ensuring coverage of these new pathways. o Technique integration – NWRC and USGS conduct BTS management related research. It is important that techniques and tactics developed by these two agencies are integrated into interdiction and control operations.
• CNMI DFW o Programmatic stability – In recent years, the CNMI DFW BTS program has had challenges meeting performance measures. Efforts by the CNMI DLNR, USFWS and OIA have corrected some of the operational and administrative program deficiencies, but more work is required.
17

• HDOA o Canine inspection program – In 2009, budget cuts in Hawaii resulted in the dismantling of the canine inspection team. OIA provided funds in 2010 and 2012 to re-initiate the program; however, HDOA has not met this objective. Reinstating a functioning canine program on Hawaii is a key objective of the BTS TWG.
• NWRC o Landscape suppression tools – Recent trials of manually dropping toxic baits from a helicopter have shown the feasibility of this approach. However, manually broadcasting baits is prohibitively expensive. To reduce the cost of application and scale this method up, the automated aerial baiting system (AABS), which is two-thirds through development, must become operational.
• USGS Research o Species response to BTS suppression – Aerial baiting with toxicants will substantially decrease the number of snakes over a large area. However, the response of some age classes of snakes is uncertain, as is the rate at which surviving snakes will respond. Additionally, non-target species, such as the prey of the BTS, are expected to respond to the removal of their principal predator. Therefore, it is necessary at an early stage to study the dynamics of target and non-target species to large scale suppression.
• USGS RRT o Search result confidence – The task of detecting a BTS reported outside of Guam is inherently difficult (e.g., usually involves a single individual, sightings vary in credibility). Therefore, it is necessary to have a mechanism to estimate the level of confidence in the determination that the BTS is not present. o Searcher performance – The ability to detect the BTS in the field varies greatly between searchers, which can affect the confidence level of the determination of BTS presence or absence. Protocols for assessing this variability in searcher ability need to be developed and implemented.
• GDAWR o Native bird restoration activities – In areas where the BTS is absent or sufficiently low, restoration activities to restore Guam’s native birds are or will be planned and implemented.
The intent of this Plan is: 1) to provide an overview of the history and achievements of the BTS TWG; 2) to present the current status of BTS-related activities; 3) to provide an overview of the short-term (5year) BTS management-related research themes and directions; 4) to document areas where improvements in the BTS TWG are needed and achievable; 5) to provide an overview of past BTS funding; and 6) and to detail the current and short-term funding needs under varying funding events.

3.0 TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP STATUS
3.1 CURRENT ACTIVITIES
Interdiction on Guam, and in the CNMI and Hawaii, is the principal means of realizing the primary goal of the BTS TWG, to prevent the dispersal of snakes off Guam. A Rapid Response Team (RRT) is deployed as a backup when a BTS is reported outside of Guam. Interdiction efforts are supported by research conducted on BTS biology and control techniques. Outreach plays a critical role in preventing the dispersal of the BTS from Guam as well, educating the general public and military, government and civilian personnel dealing with cargo and conveyances outbound from Guam. Achieving the BTS TWG’s second goal of protecting Guam’s human interests and aiding in the restoration of its endangered wildlife is achieved by strategically suppressing the snake population, in combination with captive rearing and release of native birds.
• Interdiction – On Guam, control and containment efforts are conducted by WS at military and civilian ports (air and sea), as well as areas where high-risk cargo is packed and consolidated. Highrisk cargo as defined by WS is cargo bound for destinations that are deemed high risk – high-risk destinations include all of tropical western pacific, Hawaii, Diego Garcia, Okinawa, and the US mainland. Tools and techniques used to control and contain the BTS on Guam have been developed by NWRC and USGS, and include trapping, toxicant bait stations, nighttime searches, canine inspections, and barriers. Using these tools, WS creates multiple layers of protection. The snake trap is the primary tool used to reduce BTS numbers. A live mouse, which is housed in a separate smaller cage inside the snake trap, is used to attract snakes to the trap. Each mouse is provided with food and moisture. On the outer perimeter of a containment zone, traps are situated along forest edges and fence lines surrounding ports and areas where cargo and vehicles are packed and staged for shipping. In some areas, BTS traps are replaced with BTS bait stations. Stations are baited with a dead neonate mouse (DNM), which has a toxicant (80 mg table of acetaminophen) inserted into the gut. Nighttime fence line searches are also conducted to capture snakes pursuing geckos on the fence. This technique is effective for targeting smaller-sized snakes, which are not as susceptible to capture in traps or toxicant bait take. This strategy provides the initial layer of protection to prevent snakes entering areas with high-risk cargo. Inside the first-line perimeter, outgoing aircraft and highrisk cargo undergo canine inspection. In the CNMI, traps and canine inspections are used by CNMI DFW, similar to methods employed by WS on Guam. Barriers are also used for suspect cargo incoming from Guam, in which case it is staged inside a secure area until a thorough inspection can be conducted. In Hawaii, HDOA PQB personnel visually inspect high-risk cargo and aircraft arriving from Guam. Maintaining fully functional BTS interdiction programs in high-risk locations such as the CNMI and Hawaii, which have the capacity to conduct secondary canine and visual inspection, and Rapid Response (see below), is essential to preventing the establishment of this pest species outside of Guam.
• Control – WS conducts targeted population control of the BTS on Guam around military housing using traps and nighttime searches. This has a twofold benefit. Suppressing snake numbers in and
19

around housing improves the well-being of residents by reducing snake encounters and minimizing the risk of snakebite. It also lowers the probability of snakes entering cargo when families relocate. Using traps, nighttime searches, and some bait stations, WS also controls the BTS at 19 GPA power substations in an effort to reduce snake-related power outages. Control of the BTS over larger spatial scales is in the initial testing phase and is described in more detail in the “Research Committee Research Strategy” section below. This large-scale control of the BTS is termed “suppression.” • Rapid Response Team – The RRT was established in 2002 and is administered by the USGS. The RRT was established to: 1) conduct searcher training courses on Guam, 2) provide experienced searchers for extra-limital (i.e., outside of Guam) searches, 3) assist in communicating new developments in BTS science to recipient islands, and 4) provide guidance and assistance during responses to BTS sightings. Overall the RRT is comprised of 35 to 70 members from U.S. federal, state, and territorial agencies, as well as NGOs and foreign governments dispersed across more than a dozen Pacific islands and the U.S. mainland. The RRT is deployed when a credible snake sighting is reported from a snake-free island. Between 2002 and 2007, the RRT responded to 16 snake reports, the majority of those in the CNMI. • Research – BTS-related core research is conducted primarily by two federal agencies, NWRC and USGS. NWRC concentrates its research on the development of tools for the control and detection of the BTS, such as trap design, toxicant registration, and bait testing. Specific examples of techniques and applications are presented in Table 1. USGS focuses its efforts on understanding the biology and ecology of the BTS, including its impact on Guam’s ecosystems, which informs all areas of operations, management and methods development. USGS also has important roles in testing and validating control tools and monitoring population status of the BTS. BTS-related research activities are covered in more detail in the “Research Committee Research Strategy” section below. • Outreach – Increasing public awareness on Guam, the CNMI, Hawaii, FAS, and other Pacific islands is vital to the goals of the BTS TWG. On Guam, WS distributes print and electronic media to inform the public of the threats of the BTS and the risks associated with transporting snakes off island. For large military exercises, DoD distributes brochures for incoming personnel and requires they watch an instructional video on the BTS. GDAWR and the GNWR educate the public on the need to preserve Guam’s biodiversity and impacts The BTS has caused. GDAWR is currently conducting a BTS awareness campaign, Kontre I Kulepbla (Challenge the Snake), to increase the public’s awareness of BTS control tools and preparing Guam for acceptance of large-scale BTS-suppression efforts. On Guam, the RRT also conducts outreach for school groups and public events, and the USGS maintains a website with BTS information. In the CNMI, CNMI DFW has produced radio broadcasts informing the public of the threat from BTS invading their islands, provides a BTS hotline to report snake sightings, and has historically visited schools to conduct BTS education programs. On Hawaii, CGAPS launched the multimedia “Silent Invasion Campaign” on invasive species, including the BTS. In addition, personnel from HDOA PQB, HDLNR, and DOFAW conduct outreach programs on invasive species, including the BTS.
20

• Restoration – Four species of birds have been the center of BTS-related restoration efforts. Two of these, the Guam rail and Guam Micronesian kingfisher are bred in captivity by GDAWR on Guam and in several U.S. mainland zoos for release in snake-free areas. Due to the efforts of GDAWR, rails have been released, and are believed established, on both Rota in the CNMI and on Cocos Island, an 83 acre islet immediately south of Guam. Both of the aforementioned sites are considered snake-free. Historically, GDAWR and partner agencies successfully protected Mariana crow nests in the wild from BTS predation. The Mariana swiftlet population on Guam was also impacted by the BTS. DON biologists oversee conservation efforts to protect the swiftlets that persist in three caves. This includes trapping around the caves by WS to reduce BTS predation on the birds. This project is not directly restoration, but the results will inform future efforts to restore swiftlets to other locations on Guam.
During a 12-month period starting in 2010, the BTS TWG used a structured process for multi-agency prioritization of BTS control efforts (Woods and Morey 2011). This process involved more than 30 participants representing all federal, territorial and state agencies participating in the BTS TWG. One component of this effort was an assessment of the feasibility of avian species restoration on Guam. Two outcomes resulted from this assessment. First, there was an expressed desire to restore species faster than the current rate, but the recognition that the actual number of species restored would likely be much lower (Figure 8). Second, shortage of snake-free habitat and funding were identified as factors limiting the restoration of native birds on Guam.

3.2 TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP ASSESSMENT
The BTS TWG has been labeled a “success story ready to happen” (Colvin et al. 2005). It could more aptly be termed a “success story in progress.” Having prevented the BTS from establishing outside of Guam, the BTS TWG is achieving its primary goal and is working toward minimizing the impacts of the BTS on Guam. Additionally, restoration projects of native species on Guam have demonstrated important achievements, such as the establishment of rails on Cocos Island and preservation of the Mariana swiftlet. Despite these successes, the BTS TWG recognizes there is considerable opportunity for improvement.
During the preparation of this Strategic Plan, the BTS TWG identified a number of problems or issues related to BTS activities. These issues range from inadequate data management that impact efficiency and reporting to the critical loss of an entire interdiction program. Progress in some of these areas is attainable by assessing project activities, increasing project efficiency, and improving BTS TWG coordination and management. Conversely, some advances will require an increase in funding and others a change from the year-to-year funding cycle to one of stable base funding. BTS TWG research needs are not addressed here, but are covered in the following section.
• Data & Information Issues – The BTS TWG is large and complex, encompassing a wide range of entities, each with a unique mission and operational hierarchy, which greatly complicates BTS TWG data reporting and analysis. Progress needs to be made by the BTS TWG and its partner agencies to address data management, programmatic performance, and the tracking of funds. o Snake sighting database – It is critical to have access to accurate and up-to-date information on BTS sightings outside of Guam to assess the effectiveness of interdiction efforts. Prior the preparation of this Plan, information on sightings of the BTS outside of Guam was in a state of disarray. Documents containing information on extra-limital sights were outdated and contained errors. The electronic database(s) on snake sightings were not readily accessible and contained errors. Recently effort has been put into correcting and verifying the information in the electronic database. Further effort is now required to make this database accessible to persons involved in the BTS TWG. o BTS-caused power outages – Power outages caused by the BTS are one of the metrics frequently used to describe the impacts of the BTS on Guam. The economic cost of power outages are also used in studies projecting the potential economic impact on islands, such as Hawaii, if BTS were to establish. However, the last comprehensive examination of BTS-caused outages on Guam was published in 2002 and reports data ending in 1997. To accurately assess the effectiveness of snake control conducted by WS at substations and transmission lines and estimate the potential impact of the BTS on other islands, it is essential to monitor and analyze BTS-caused outages on Guam. o Funding and expenditure tracking – Development of this Plan has highlighted the need to improve tracking of funds and maintain a comprehensive funding database for the
22

entire BTS TWG. Each funding and recipient agency manages its respective budget (or financial input and output) related to BTS TWG activities and expenditures; however, conducting a comprehensive financial analysis of the BTS TWG is problematic due to factors, such as the differing accounting practices of agencies and the tracking of funds on multi-year projects.
• Programmatic Needs – Although the BTS TWG has achieved advancements in areas of methods development and inspection rates of outgoing cargo to high risk areas there are many programmatic areas in need of improvement. o HDOA canine inspection program – Due to statewide budget constraints HDOA PQB dismantled its canine inspection team in 2009. Despite an infusion of funding in 2010 and 2012 from OIA, HDOA has not reinstated its canine inspection program. It is critical that the canine inspection program be reactivated on Hawaii. o CNMI DFW interdiction program performance – In recent years, the CNMI DFW BTS program has had challenges meeting performance measures. Correction of operational and administrative program deficiencies has required significant effort by the CNMI DLNR, USFWS and OIA. Efforts to ensure CNMI DFW BTS program success are on-going, with improvement in certain aspects of program implementation. o RRT training & protocols – Since 2002, the RRT Coordinator has trained dozens of personnel from many of the BTS partner entities, which greatly improved searcher capacity on the region’s islands. However, the ability of searchers to detect the BTS in field situations diminishes without regular interaction with the snake. Therefore, it is recognized that searchers should undergo refresher training every two years. Many of the RRT members (e.g., 80% of Hawaii’s 51 searchers) are overdue for refresher training, which will require substantial funding to complete. In addition to developing and maintaining BTS searcher capacity within the region, it is necessary to develop guidelines and protocols, similar to an incident command system, specific to each jurisdiction, which clearly delegates authorities and responsibilities to the relevant agencies in the event of an extra-limital BTS sighting resulting in a search effort. o Disaster planning – Guam is subject to frequent tropical storms. These storms not only impact the island, they can disable the BTS interdiction program, as happened in 2002 when Super Typhoon Pongsona hit Guam. WS has taken some steps to prevent a similar occurrence, including obtaining secure areas for trap storage and developing a “Typhoon/Tropical Storm SOP.” Continued focus on disaster planning and programmatic capacity is needed. Similarly, additional infrastructure is needed to ensure that the BTS interdiction program is less vulnerable to storms. o The Brown Treesnake Control and Eradication Act of 2004 Reauthorization – The Brown Treesnake Control and Eradication Act of 2004 expired in 2010. It authorized up to $10.6M in annual appropriations for DOI- and USDA-funded interdiction, control, and research activities. However, limited funding was allocated via the Act. Instead, the BTS
23

TWG has been primarily supported year-to-year on OIA technical assistance funds and DoD funds associated with regulatory requirements stemming from the ESA. The Brown Treesnake Control and Eradication Act of 2004 provided a clear structure for BTS TWG and defined federal agency roles related to BTS management. It included provisions that could have been used for federal rule-making related to BTS interdiction; however, these were not adequately funded. A reauthorized and strengthened Act could provide stronger federal legal authority for BTS interdiction. Similarly, a re-authorized Act that includes, DOI, DoD, USDA, and DOT could provide the range of federal agencies impacted by the BTS a mechanism to authorize appropriations for BTS control efforts. Lastly, a reauthorized and strengthened Brown Treesnake Control and Eradication Act of 2004 could be a mechanism to provide stability for existing BTS programs. o Standardize QA (Quality Assessment) BTS operational programs – BTS interdiction is conducted by three distinct programs with different protocols, procedures, and capacities. To provide operational continuity and improve operational efficacy, the three interdiction programs should develop standardized QA protocols. This would include regular assessment of new pathways for extra-limital BTS dispersal on Guam and at recipient sites. Similarly efforts should be made to standardize canine detection program efficacy between WS, Hawaii, and the CNMI DFW. o Container inspection tracking / certification – Most freight arriving at the Port comes from freight forwarding companies in sealed containers. Prior to delivery to the Port, WS inspects the interior of the containers and their contents on the property of the freight forwarding company. However, there is no certification system in effect that ensures the containers remain closed and BTS free after inspection by WS. The inability to ensure a container remains sealed after inspection creates a breach in the process, which poses a risk that uninspected containers will arrive at the Port. PAG has stated it will work with all cooperating entities involved in the BTS inspection process to ensure this problem is adequately addressed (USFWS; PAG 2013). o Interdiction program funding – Efforts are needed to ensure programmatic stability for interdiction efforts on Guam, the CNMI, and Hawaii. The WS program highlights this issue. Due to reductions in the federal budget in 2011, the WS program on Guam lost most base programmatic funding from USDA. Currently, the WS interdiction program on Guam is primarily supported via reimbursable funds from DOI and DoD. Ensuring the programmatic stability for WS is critical to preventing the spread of the BTS to new locations. Secure base funding versus year-to-year funding is needed to ensure longterm viability of interdiction on Guam and other islands.

3.3 RESEARCH COMMITTEE STRATEGY
Federal Agencies Performing BTS Research Research on the BTS has traditionally been funded by DOI through grants from OIA, but DoD has provided periodic support for research through specific grants and contracts. BTS research is designed to be complementary; NWRC focuses its research on methods development, whereas USGS concentrates on understanding the effects of BTS control and interdiction. This approach has created a more efficient process by clarifying the roles of the research agencies, yet allows for the opportunity to cooperate on projects when necessary.
NWRC – The agency develops and improves methodologies with the objective of improving the overall efficacy of BTS management. NWRC is addressing multiple areas critical to BTS management. First, it is committed to developing tools, such as the automated aerial baiting system (AABS) and artificial baits, which will enhance the ability to conduct large-scale control of the BTS. Second, the agency is working to develop methods to augment the current suite of interdiction tools, such as chemical and thermal irritants to clear cargo of snakes. NWRC also reviews operational methods and tools and conducts program analyses to ensure control and interdiction efforts are as efficacious as possible.
USGS – USGS has a multi-faceted research program designed to inform and enhance BTS operational efforts. The agency’s research is focused on understanding the effect of removal techniques on all segments of the BTS population, such as the variation in response to trapping among age or size classes. USGS uses these insights in its research to help refine methods to suppress the BTS at the local and landscape scale. Additionally, USGS pursues research projects aimed at increasing the ability to detect the BTS at low densities and maximize the efficiency of Early Detection & Rapid Response (EDRR). Both agencies are cooperating in research designed to evaluate ecosystem changes that occur through BTS control methods to understand the impact of large-scale (temporal and spatial) control efforts on the environment.
BTS Research History
High-quality, output-driven research has been a hallmark of BTS control and containment programs since their inception. When the BTS was identified as the cause of bird declines and extinctions on Guam in the mid-1980s, little was known about this species of snake in either its native or invasive range. Meanwhile, the only existing research program on snake control focused on human health risks associated with venomous snakes on small Japanese islands (Rodda et al 1999c). This meant that researchers were starting from scratch with a poorly known target animal and no proven control tools. Initial BTS research efforts thus focused on investigating the basic biology of the snake to discover potential vulnerabilities, while simultaneously developing and testing control tools (especially traps); these two research areas continue to interact strongly, as nearly every new finding on the biology of the BTS helps refine our collective understanding of the efficacy of control tools. Concurrent with the early
25

investigations on the biology of the BTS and control methods, researchers were documenting the high economic costs of the snake on Guam, as well as risks to human health.
The first few years of BTS research effort were spearheaded by staff from GDAWR and USFWS (the research arm of USFWS was later split off to form USGS and NWRC). In the early 1990s, researchers and vertebrate control experts from NWRC and WS joined BTS research and control efforts. An array of scientists has been involved in BTS research over the years, including cooperators from territorial, state, and federal agencies as well as universities and other NGOs. However, it is notable that only a few individuals in federal research agencies have been the primary drivers of BTS research for the last two decades, and that all control tools currently in use are the product of development and testing efforts led by these same federal research agencies.
An important product of early research efforts by NWRC and USGS was the BTS trap. USGS researchers initially developed and tested the concept of a mouse-baited snake trap with one-way entrances, and over the course of testing dozens of trap variables, they succeeded in achieving capture rates that are two orders of magnitude higher than the average for snake traps worldwide (Rodda et al. 1999a). Once trap capture rates had been maximized, NWRC and WS biologists took the existing design and made the traps easier to service and more durable, while conducting field research to ensure that capture rates remained high. These traps remain the most effective snake traps in use anywhere in the world (Rodda et al. 1999a). Overall, the development, testing, and validation of control tools via intensive research programs has directly contributed to the success of interdiction efforts by operational agencies, as these agencies currently use the products of this research.
The need to establish snake-proof barriers became apparent early in efforts to interdict the BTS. To that end, researchers in the 1990s designed and tested barriers capable of excluding the BTS. The foremost challenges to excluding snakes were overcoming their excellent climbing abilities and designing access points that allow human entry and exit, but block the BTS. Because of the work conducted by BTS TWG partnering research agencies, a suite of barrier types have been deployed in Guam and the CNMI, including temporary barriers to reduce snake incursions into military materiel during short-term interisland exercises, permanent concrete barriers for use around ports, and concrete-base/wire-mesh barriers to enclose conservation areas. These remain the only fully-tested snake barriers in existence anywhere in the world.
After initial development of effective traps and barriers, managers had tools to reduce the risk of the BTS infiltrating Guam’s out-going transportation system. However, no tool is 100% effective; therefore researchers developed tools to chemically exclude the BTS via repellents and expelling or killing snakes in cargo via fumigation and thermal treatments. Unfortunately, environmental and cargo-integrity concerns have hampered their use in operations. Research to test the efficacy of canine teams in detecting snakes planted in cargo and other parts of the transportation network increased confidence in ongoing efforts to keep snakes from escaping Guam. Subsequently, validation of canine teams for
26

finding the BTS in forests offered a new means of detecting and localizing incipient populations on other islands in response to snake sightings. Budgetary constraints have hindered the full implementation of this program.
While the control tools developed by the research program are productive in terms of the number of snakes removed from transportation pathways and high-priority ecological areas, questions remained about the level of population suppression resulting from the application of a given tool and the feasibility of eradication at any scale. Therefore, validation of control tools (visual searching, trapping, toxicant application) at a population level were a major research focus over the last decade, with the goal of understanding which snakes are missed by each tool and how the size and sex of missed snakes might affect population recovery and control opportunities. Such efforts required large investments in fieldwork and development of quantitative tools for analyzing the resulting datasets.
More recently, significant progress has been made towards developing landscape-scale control tools using ground-based and aerial delivery of a snake toxicant. After years of intensive research, in 1999 a highly effective toxicant (acetaminophen) was registered by the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) for use on the BTS. Over the last five years, the AABS has undergone many steps in a multi-phase development process. Several stages have been completed and the results are promising. Other research avenues have thus far failed to bear fruit in terms of an effective control tool despite considerable energy and funds being expended on them. Small-scale trials of biological control using parasites were attempted with captive snakes, but results were not promising and the method was judged to be of low utility for field application. Similarly, multiple experiments have been conducted to assess pheromonal control of the BTS; results using captive snakes have not been successfully replicated in field trials on Guam. Some of these lines of inquiry, such as toxicant application, deserve additional research effort, while for others the odds are very low that that the technique will yield an effective control tool.
BTS Research & Methods Development – Current & Future Needs
Current snake management strategies have been successful in decreasing, but not eliminating, the probability of snakes becoming established on other islands and positioning managers for restoration of native species. To increase the efficacy of these programs, broaden the scope of control efforts, and develop new tools, additional work is required to understand the effect of control and interdiction strategies on snake populations, snake behavior, and ecosystems. Overall, more research needs to be performed to understand and predict the response of BTS populations to control strategies and tools.
To more effectively and efficiently build on the research successes of the past, the BTS TWG chartered the BTS Research Committee (BTS RC) in 2012. The primary goal of the BTS RC is to develop strategic long-term plans and short-term priorities for advancing research on the BTS, focusing on developing the biological knowledge and technical ability required to meet the management goals of the BTS TWG.
27

Membership on the BTS RC is drawn from the BTS TWG, as well as subject matter experts from academic institutions and the scientific community. Despite the varied missions and priorities of the involved organizations, it rapidly became apparent to all BTS RC members that although BTS research has been remarkably successful, a critical historical weakness remains in place: the lack of predictable base funding for agencies responsible for BTS research. Conducting BTS research and methods development with funds solely from intermittent grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts impacts programs and efficiency in several ways:
1. Staffing continuity – Research and methods development projects based on annual funding often results in a cyclic process of hiring personnel for a single project, investing in training and orienting the employee, then releasing the employee at the end of the contract. This process limits the ability to develop program capacity, is inefficient, and costly. Additionally, intermittent funding for BTS projects implies a degree of uncertainty, which can hinder the ability to leverage resources (e.g., staffing) from cooperating agencies.
2. Sub-contracting costs – Sub-contracting some aspects of projects can be useful; however, the inability to hire permanent or semi-permanent staff often results in an over-reliance on subcontractors. This has a tendency to increase project costs since each entity charges overhead and has additional start-up costs.
3. Strategically limited projects – Many of the problems inherent to the pursuit of eradication of the BTS from Guam require multi-phase projects that are based on incremental advancements that are directed by results from the preceding stages. Annual funding streams limit researchers from planning and proposing multi-year projects. The uncertainty of receiving funds from yearto-year constrains researchers into conceptualizing and designing projects that can be accomplished in a single funding cycle.
To support the BTS TWG Strategic Plan, the BTS RC generated overarching “Research Themes” (Table 2.). These themes are broken into: (1) Interdiction, Early Detection & Rapid Response; (2) LandscapeScale Suppression; and (3) Restoration. Each theme was then populated with what the BTS RC recommended were the highest “Priority Research Areas.” The recommended themes and priority research areas were then approved by the entire BTS TWG. More details regarding the priority research areas are provided below.
Effective management and interdiction efforts require a thorough understanding of snake population response to trapping, toxicant application, and other control efforts. Although interdiction and control programs are effective at removing large numbers of individuals, some segments of the population may be less susceptible to removal with the tools in current use. One example is juvenile snakes, which may fail to recognize rodents as suitable prey (Lardner et al. 2009) making them less attracted than adult snakes to control tools using mice as baits (Tyrrell et al. 2009, Lardner et al. 2013).

Control of BTS in urban environments

This variation in susceptibility of the BTS to mouse baits is one of the underlying problems for population control and interdiction. Researchers have been trying to understand how variation in efficacy of control tools for smaller snakes influences the ability to suppress snakes at the landscape level, intercept snakes moving through areas of interdiction protecting resources (e.g., cargo consolidation areas, ports areas, power lines) or to target and detect incipient snake populations. Understanding the implications of these ‘missed’ individuals for long-term population suppression and eradication prospects is also a key research need. Repeated toxicant applications will be required over time to eliminate snakes as they grow to sizes for which mouse baits are effective. It is critical to determine the frequency and duration

29

of bait application necessary to achieve the desired level of snake suppression and how factors such as sex, size, reproductive status, and foraging history interact.
Snakes arriving on other islands pose additional problems. They are often difficult to locate, therefore a need exists for tools for detecting snakes at very low densities. The utility of canine searches for the BTS in the forest has been validated, but more research effort is needed to make this technique fully operational. Aside from the “needle in the haystack” problem of trying to detect snakes at low densities, food resources are also often abundant and therefore snakes may not be attracted to standard mousebaited traps. The latter is of particular concern when attempting to detect low-density snakes on recipient islands such as Saipan or Oahu. It is important to determine how to make control techniques effective in food-rich environments on other islands or areas with alternative prey (e.g., introduced frogs). Basic biological concepts need to be investigated to target these individuals to ensure that control efforts are effective.
Recent trials of aerial drops have progressed to the stage that there is promise that this method can control snakes over large areas. However, these trials only demonstrate a proof of concept. Manually broadcasting baits, while feasible, is prohibitively expensive. The AABS would increase the efficiency of broadcasting baits at least 40-fold compared to hand broadcast, greatly decrease helicopter time. To reduce the cost of application and scale this method up, the AABS must become operational. The AABS is more than two thirds through its development and implementation process, but continued funding is needed to proceed with the next stage. Concurrent with the development of the AABS, efforts to develop artificial baits to replace the dead mice that are used with aerial broadcast are being pursued. Currently, live adult mice and dead neonatal mice (DNM) are the only bait effective at attracting the BTS, which presents several problems. Live mice are expensive to purchase and maintain, and DNMs are only effective for a few days before decomposition renders them ineffective. Mice are also difficult to deploy in the field, requiring separate housing for live mice within BTS traps and “streamers” attached to DNM for air-drops. Although bait development has yet to show efficacy in the field after several years of effort, further research is warranted.
As control strategies shift from site-specific control to large scale suppression, the effect of snake removal on other animals is needed so we can effectively prepare for unintended consequences of snake removal. Once snakes are removed, the densities of rodents and lizards may increase significantly. Evidence for this can be found on nearby snake-free islands, which have rodent densities more than 10 times those on Guam (Wiewel et al. 2009). As noted above, high rodent densities may make control or interdiction tools less effective. Similarly, lizard populations and recently introduced frog populations may increase in size in response to BTS suppression providing more potential prey for the BTS, which could confound control efforts (Christy et al. 2007, Campbell et al. 2012). High rodent densities could not only complicate BTS control, it could also result in economic or ecological damage, with the potential to impact restoration of native birds (Sweetapple and Nugent 2007). Integrating multiple sources of information on the biology of the BTS and its prey and the population-level efficacy of control
30

tools will allow much more precise predictive models that will allow managers to understand the degree of snake suppression that can be expected as a result of a given control program and how populations of the prey of BTS may respond.
Restoration of native species throughout Guam is contingent upon having effective BTS control techniques and then applying these on a large scale. Most of the current and historic BTS research, from individual tool development to broad-scale suppression strategies, contributes to the eventual restoration of Guam’s native species and its ecosystem as a whole. Up to now, successful releases and protection of native species have been limited in scope due to the endangered status of the species involved in the release projects (i.e., limited amount of crows and permissions for release,). These smallscale field studies have developed release methodologies, and successful strategies for protection of nesting individuals from snake predation (Aguon et al. 1999). With broad-scale BTS control strategies available for testing in suitable release sights, releases of native species and inroads to recovery are possible.
Some aspects of restoration can be advanced through modeling. For instance, research on the spatial dynamics and life history characteristics of Guam rail populations on Rota or Cocos are necessary to conduct minimum viable population analyses, which could then aid in determining the size of snake exclosure necessary for the persistence of a rail population. The enhanced ability to measure/remove snakes at low densities would assist in improving the efficiency of snake control programs. The lowdensity snake population measurements could feed into models that determine the level of snake control necessary to allow native species to persist in the wild.
The above described priority research areas are vital to improving control and interdiction techniques and advancing the progress towards large-scale control of the BTS on Guam, the latter being a requisite step for restoring native birds on the island. These research areas are also essential for developing and improving the techniques to detect and eradicate new BTS populations should they become established in the CNMI, Hawaii, or elsewhere, as well as to assist in the protection and restoration of resources should the BTS establish elsewhere.

4.0 BROWN TREESNAKE FUNDING
4.1 FUNDING HISTORY
Formal funding for the BTS management efforts began in 1987, with DOI providing $100,000 to the research arm of USFWS (Figure 9; $202,000 in 2012 adj. for inflation; USFWS BTS Research later became part of the USGS). Since 1987, annual BTS related-funding has increased substantially, peaking at more than $9.0M in 2010, and then dropping to $7.5M in 2012. Overall, DOI has provided the majority of the funding, contributing $51.5 M, and was the primary Department supporting the BTS TWG during the first seven years. Sustained support from DoD began in 1994, coinciding with WS’s entry into the BTS TWG. Overall, DoD has provided $39.7M in funding. Although total DOI and DoD contributions to the BTS TWG are comparable; the funds from each agency generally support different areas. Most DoD funds are directed towards interdiction and control efforts on Guam, with periodic support for research to develop BTS control methods. The latter is from specific multi-year programs (e.g., DoD Legacy and Environmental Security Technology Certification Program). Compared with DoD, DOI funds are more widely dispersed across programs. From 2009 through 2012, DOI provided funding support for interdiction efforts on Hawaii and the CNMI, restoration on Guam, and BTS research. (For specific information on agencies receiving funds, refer to the “BTS TWG Partner and TWG Status” sections for agency roles and activities.). From 1998 to 2010, USDA-APHIS (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) provided substantial BTS TWG support, totaling $8.3 M, with WS receiving all of those funds.

Several other entities have provided funding to the BTS TWG, including HISC, USACE (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers), and GPA, totaling $1.9M. Between 1987 and 2012, more than $101.3M has been directed toward BTS-related management, research, and restoration. Not included in this figure is a considerable amount of agency support by DoD, USFWS, USGS, and USDA in the form of salaries, overhead, and cyclical funds. Also not accounted for are funds for a dog kennel constructed on Guam by DoD.
The majority of BTS funding ($56.5M) has supported interdiction and control on Guam conducted by WS (Figure 10a). During the first five years of WS operations, 100% of funds went toward interdiction. Beginning in 1999, WS diversified their BTS role, working on projects related to research, control, and restoration. From 1999 through 2012, on average 84% of funds for WS were directed toward interdiction. During this same period, restoration efforts and BTS control on average received 6% and 7% of WS’s funds, respectively. The remainder, 3%, went toward BTS-related research.
In addition to receiving the bulk of the BTS funding, support for WS generally increased over time until 2007 when funding levels began to plateau. The fact that WS funding has exceeded all other recipient agencies combined and has also increased at a greater rate reflects the central role WS plays in preventing the movement of the BTS off Guam. The leveling off of funding to WS in 2007 corresponds to the period where it achieved a 99% inspection rate of cargo departing Guam. This, combined with a reduction in the number of credible snake sightings off Guam in recent years, suggests WS interdiction capacity is approaching the point where it can achieve an almost 100% inspection rate of high-risk cargo at the current volume and funding levels. However, this apparent financial stability of the WS program is not entirely accurate. In 2010, Congress cut funding for a range of WS programs nationally, which resulted in the elimination of long-term USDA base support for the Guam program. Currently, the program is solely supported by reimbursable DoD and DOI funds.
USGS was the earliest recipient of BTS funding and has received $22.7M. Funding for USGS tended to increase until 2002, after which its support has remained relatively static for more than a decade (Figure 10a). Although annual funding levels have been relatively stable, USGS’s capacity to conduct BTS research has diminished because of rising salaries and inflation. The increased support for USGS in 2010 was due to a one-time infusion of funding for a DoD project and reprogrammed OIA funds. NWRC has received $6.7M in support since 1991. Annual support for NWRC can best be described as erratic, with periods of funding increases offset by declines in following years. This is clearly illustrated from 2004 through 2012, when funding regularly decreased and increased five to 15-fold from year to year (Figure 10a). The stagnation of USGS support is primarily due to the level of funding available from DOI agencies, which has also been declining. The inadequate and inconsistent funding for NWRC is due to the agency’s reliance on soft-money grants for research versus base funding. This has impacted NWRC’s capacity to conduct BTS research in recent years. Both BTS core research groups require increased and more stable funding to ensure that critical research themes and objectives are met.

WS, CNMI DFW, and HDOA primarily conduct interdiction, USGS research, NWRC methods development, and GDAWR restoration.
CNMI DFW, GDAWR, and HDOA have received $5.4M, $4.9M, $4.1M, respectively (Figure 10b; see “BTS TWG Partner” and “BTS Status” sections for agency roles and activities). Smaller amounts of funding totaling less than $300K have been provided to other entities, such as Colorado State University, University of Hawaii, and Bishop Museum.

34

Examining funding for the most recent years (because details are available for this period) provides perspective on levels of support for specific activities (Figure 11). From 2009 to 2012, the federal, territorial, and state partners within the BTS TWG received $31.5M. Support for interdiction totaled $18.8M, averaging $4.8M per year, including RRT. Research and methods development received $8.4M during that same period, but funding fluctuated greatly. It should be acknowledged that a limited amount of USGS funds support RRT, an interdiction/operational effort.

4.2 FUNDING EVENTS
The funding picture for BTS management will undoubtedly change in the coming years. These changes could include incremental annual increases or decreases in funding, one-time infusions of funds, or major programmatic readjustments requiring substantial long-term augmentation of funding. To anticipate these potential developments, several future funding scenarios or “Events” have been created. Events 1a and 1b examine the impact of sequestration on funding for the BTS TWG, focusing reductions on research and restoration projects. Two additional Events, examine the effect of reductions in DOI funding on recipient activities. Event 2 (no accompanying table) estimates the cost of a

35

landscape-scale BTS control project and in Event 3, an analysis is conducted to examine the cost for WS to conduct interdiction in the CNMI and Hawaii compared to CNMI DFW and HDOA, respectively. Funding projections in these Events are based on 2012 funding levels. During 2012, the total operating funds approached $7.5M (Table 3). DoD and DOI provided the majority of the funding, with the Guam Power Authority providing WS $102K for removal of the BTS at power generating stations. Seven agencies received funding in FY12 for BTS interdiction, research, or restoration (Table 4).

Events 1a and 1b examine the impacts of the spending cuts (i.e., sequestration) that were called for in the Budget Control Act of 2011. In FY13 under sequestration, non-defense discretionary spending was reduced by approximately 4.7% ($28.7B) from FY12 funding levels (CBO 2013). If sequestration had occurred in FY14, discretionary spending would have decreased by approximately 1.6% ($9.7B) from FY13 levels. Defense discretionary spending decreased 6.5% ($42.7B) in FY13 and subsequently would be expected to decrease another 5.5% ($34.2B) in FY14 (if sequestration had occurred). Under a scenario of annual sequestration from FY14 to FY23, non-defense and defense discretionary spending would be expected to increase 2.3% and 2.1% annually, respectively. This would approximate the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) projected rate of inflation. Again, this exercise is intended to show the potential long-range impacts of sequestration on BTS control and research as an example. Event 1a (Table 3) presents budget projections on the potential effects of sequestration on funding for the BTS TWG. DoD funding for interdiction and control is differentiated from DOI funding for research and restoration because legal drivers (e.g. Biological Opinions, Installation BTS Instructions, DoD Transportation Regulations) mandate that DoD fund interdiction and control activities. DoD funding for

interdiction and control in FY13 remained essentially unchanged from FY12. Factoring in inflationary increases from FY14 through FY18 in a sequestration scenario the funding for interdiction and control would be expected to increase approximately 11% from FY12. DoD funding for research and restoration in FY13 declined approximately 39% from the $945K allocated in FY12. After accounting for an additional reduction in FY14 in a sequestration scenario and marginal inflationary increases (2.1% per annum) from FY15 through FY18, funding for research and restoration will have declined by 37% since FY12. DOI funding declined 6% from FY12 to FY13 and is projected to decline another 8% in FY14 in a sequestration scenario. Inflationary increases from FY14 through FY18 should stabilize DOI funding in Event 1a; however, the agency’s BTS funding in FY18 will have decreased 5% from FY12 funding if sequestration projections were to hold. Funding from GPA is not directly affected by sequestration; therefore its funding is not expected to be reduced and since FY00 GPA has increased funding on average 7% per year, which is the value used to calculate annual increases in funding.

Event 1b uses the projected sequestration-related funding reductions discussed above for DOI in Event 1a and extrapolates the effects on recipient agencies (Table 4). In this sequestration scenario, FY14

Table 4. Funding event 1b budget projections examine the effect of sequestration on DOI funded Brown Treesnake Technical Working Group agencies conducting research and restoration. Funds for interdiction and control activities are not subject to reduction in support, therefore funding for GDAWR, USFWS, NWRC, and USGS is reduced by 13.5% from FY13 to FY14. Note that NWRC received an additional $380,521 from DOD in FY12. Projections are based on 2012 funding levels.

funds for interdiction and control are kept constant from FY13 to FY14. The overall DOI sequestrationrelated 8% reduction in funds from FY13 to FY14 is spread across fewer programs resulting in a 13.5% cut to GDAWR, USFWS, NWRC, and USGS. Afterwards funding for all programs is increased annually by 2.3%. The effect of sequestration on DOI funded activities is projected to flatten funding for research and restoration, such that FY18 funds approximate FY13 funding levels. It should be noted for some agencies such as NWRC this exercise is unrealistic since their annual funding for BTS-related research is not based on an annual funding and has fluctuated greatly over the preceding 10 years (Figure 9a).
Under Event 1a, the capacity of WS to conduct interdiction and control on Guam should remain unaffected, unless traffic from Guam increases or military training activities increase substantially. In contrast, the reduction in DoD funded research will have widespread ramifications. Recent DoD funding was instrumental in preparation for and implementation of the 2013 aerial toxicant drop on the Habitat Management Unit on Andersen (HMU) and Munitions Storage Area (MSA) on AAFB, each 136 acres. The DoD also provided funding essential to the development of the automated aerial broadcast system (AABS), which is a key component to making aerial toxicant drops cost effective. Reductions in funding could stall the progress made thus far, delaying the use of the HMU for restoration efforts on Guam.
DOI sequestration-related reductions in funding for research described in the Event 1b would fall heavily on USGS and NWRC. A sizeable portion of USGS FY13 research funding is devoted to projects focused on understanding the effects of the aerial toxicant drops on snakes and other species. Thus, Event 1b would further impact species restoration efforts. Event 1b would also seriously impact BTS TWG coordination, which has the potential to diminish interdiction overall, particularly in the CNMI where DOI currently provides significant programmatic oversight in addition to funding.
The previous events examined effect of sequestration-related decreases in funding. Event 2 calculates the cost of conducting a large-scale BTS control project on Guam. Two potential demonstration sites for landscape-scale BTS control and endangered species restoration exist on Guam. The first is the HMU. A second potential site for applying this landscape-level BTS control in the future is the 385-acre GNWR. BTS control could be achieved by using the aforementioned aerial application of acetaminophen-treated baits. Bait delivery would be by hand from helicopter, conducted twice monthly for six months, then once each month for the next 12 months. This project is estimated to cost approximately $1.5M, of which 70% would be helicopter time and 25% bait costs. The estimate for this exercise incorporates only the cost of applying the toxicant baits and does not cover other components of restoration, such as fence completion ($750K) and maintenance ($97K), and BTS population monitoring. This project estimate illustrates that large-scale control of the BTS could be an expensive prospect and that the majority of the expense for such a project would be in helicopter time and bait. As described above, an automated aerial broadcast system (AABS) is in development. When operational, an AABS would increase the efficiency of bait delivery by 40 times, reducing flight time, thus decreasing the overall cost of the method.
38

Event 3 examines the cost of a two programmatic adjustments. These are the replacement of the HDOA and CNMI DFW BTS interdiction programs with WS. As mentioned in the “Technical Working Group Assessment” section of this document, BTS interdiction efforts in Hawaii have been inadequate since 2009, when the canine inspection program was deactivated. In the event HDOA is unable to reactivate the canine inspection program, WS is prepared to develop an interdiction program for Hawaii. Event 3 compares the annual funding provided by DOI to HDOA to implement a canine inspection program and the cost necessary for WS to undertake the interdiction efforts (Table 5). The cost to have WS conduct BTS interdiction in the State of Hawaii would be almost twice that of a fully functioning HDOA program. Several factors contribute to higher cost of WS conducting interdiction compared to HDOA. Because the federalized Hawaii program would be isolated from WS in Guam, it is imperative to have a supervisor in Hawaii. That position accounts for about 20% of the overall cost and overhead contributes another 16%. In addition, federal wages are higher than state wages for a comparable position.

Table 5. Funding event 3 compares cost between HDOA and WS to re-initiate and implement the canine inspection program in Honolulu, Hawaii and CNMI DFW and WS to conduct interdiction efforts in the CNMI. Estimates are adjusted by the CBO average annual inflation rate (2.3%).

Similarly, CNMI DFW interdiction efforts in the CNMI did not meet programmatic objectives between 2010 and 2011. Beginning in mid-2012, under the guidance of USFWS, CNMI DFW has improved its interdiction capabilities. Despite improvement, the CNMI DFW BTS program continues to face operational deficiencies and administrative challenges. If the CNMI DFW BTS program is unable to meet programmatic goals, one alternative would be to have WS implement an interdiction program in the CNMI. The cost for this would be substantial (Table 5). It should be noted that $188,468 of the FY14 CNMI DFW budget funds the USFWS biologist overseeing the program. This funding covers salary, benefits, vehicle and operating expenses. The considerable higher cost of WS assuming interdiction in the CNMI is due primarily to wages of federal versus territorial Employees. A more detailed analysis of both funding estimates is provided in Appendices D and E.

Implementing Event 3, in both Hawaii and the CNMI, would come at significantly greater cost to the BTS TWG, requiring an additional $649K per year in support. The extra cost of WS conducting interdiction in both island systems would bring greater programmatic continuity and probably increased expertise. A

potential negative, would be local concern related to the federalization of former state / territorial functions.
4.3 FUTURE FUNDING NEEDS
As mentioned earlier in this document, BTS interdiction is currently funded by DOI and DoD. DOI - OIA primarily funds BTS interdiction in support of civilian sector activities on Guam, the CNMI and Hawaii. DoD primarily funds BTS interdiction in support of military sector activities on Guam and the CNMI.
The majority of BTS funding from DOI is provided by OIA through grants from its technical assistance program. OIA has recognized the need to fund BTS research and interdiction and consistently supported BTS efforts since 1990. Several regulatory mechanisms (e.g. Biological Opinions, Installation BTS Instructions, DoD Transportation Regulations) ensure consistent BTS interdiction funding for DoDrelated and Port Authority of Guam activities, prompting the creation of regulations and procedures, such as the Defense Transportation Regulation, Part V and Installation BTS Instructions for NBG and AAFB. The role of ESA consultations related to the funding of BTS interdiction is likely to remain a constant as shipping and transport increase from Guam in the future.
The scale and rate of military activities on Guam and in the CNMI are expected to increase, putting additional pressure on BTS programs in each of the respective locations. When military personnel or equipment move from Guam to the CNMI for these training activities BTS inspections are required. The CNMI DFW interdiction program does not have the personnel to maintain regular inspections on Tinian and simultaneously respond to all of the military activities. DoD has funded WS to provide additional interdiction coverage during training exercise on Tinian when the exercise is beyond the capacity of the CNMI DFW interdiction program. To date WS has had sufficient program capacity to manage the level of interdiction efforts related to the expanded training on Guam and Tinian. If in the future military training and associated movement between Guam and the CNMI reaches a point where the current WS staffing cannot maintain acceptable levels of interdiction, then DoD would provide the support necessary to fulfill expanded interdiction requirements to maintain interdiction goals (Stephen Mosher JRM DON, pers. comm.).
The future military relocation on Guam may increase the movement of civilian and military personnel and cargo off-island. BTS interdiction capacity will have to be evaluated and potentially be expanded to account for any increases in off-island traffic resulting from the relocation of military forces to Guam. The future military relocation on Guam may also affect the island’s civilian transportation sector. Therefore, the Port Authority of Guam (PAG) has incorporated the future military relocation in its port modernization planning studies (PAG 2008). PAG recognizes the need to mitigate the potential for BTS dispersal off of Guam via outbound marine cargo and is dedicated to work with WS and other GovGuam agencies to alleviate the increased risk of off-island transport of BTS as a result of the modernization project. As part of PAG’s Guam Commercial Port Improvement program, funded by DoD and administered under a Memorandum of Understanding between PAG and the USDOT Maritime
40

Administration (MARAD), MARAD conducted the ESA Section 7 consultation process for Guam Commercial Port Improvement program, during which MARAD prepared a BTS Interdiction Commitment, which states that PAG has committed to developing mechanisms to ensure the funding necessary to achieve the following objectives (USFWS 2010; PAG 2013):
1. Maintain WS inspection levels consistent with current regimes of outgoing cargo containers, and vessels departing from the Port of Guam bound for the U.S. or U.S. territories;
2. Maintain BTS suppression at the Port of Guam at all commercial cargo staging, packing, handling, and trans-shipment facilities located at the Port of Guam handling cargo outbound for the U.S. or U.S territories;
3. Maintain BTS suppression around the perimeter of the Port of Guam property; 4. Maintain current levels of BTS inspection and quarantine for cargo, containers, and vessels
departing at the Port of Guam; and 5. Maintain current BTS detection and monitoring at recipient sites at the Port of Guam with
established federally-funded interdiction programs (PAG 2013).
There is also a need for continued or potential increase in funding support for the BTS Programs in CNMI and Hawaii based on the likely increase in traffic, both by air and sea, due to the possibility of military relocation to Guam. These jurisdictions are on the receiving end of both modes of transports for passengers and goods. The likely relocation will enhance the threat of BTS dispersion to these jurisdictions.
In addition to the potential need for increased funding due to the future programmatic expansion connected with the growth in the military and civilian sectors on Guam, there is a need to continue funding for research on interdiction, suppression, and eradication. The BTS RC has developed an Action Plan that outlines a series of themes and priority research areas (see Table 2 “Research Strategy” section and Appendix F) that when pursued should yield improved tools to conduct interdiction and rapid response capabilities. On a grander scale these research priority areas provide a pathway to largescale suppression of the BTS on Guam, which when achieved will not only enhance interdiction efforts, but lead to the ultimate goal of the recovery of the island’s native birds.
To make progress with the challenge of suppressing the BTS on a landscape scale, a new funding model for the BTS research is required. Consistency in research can best be achieved by stability in funding, which is why it is important that USGS and NWRC obtain stable baseline funding to maintain the year-toyear capacity of their BTS research programs. NWRC estimates its annual base costs at $709K, which covers salaries and benefits, travel, equipment, and administrative overhead (Appendix G). USGS estimates its annual base costs to be between $1.75M and $2.04M, including the RRT Coordinator position (Appendix H). The numbers provided above reflect variability in effective indirect rates charged by the Fort Collins Science Center (FORT) on incoming agreements. Indirect costs are reduced for DOI agencies, with the difference being made up by USGS at the bureau level. Furthermore, the facilities indirect charges (for use of FORT facilities) are waived for funds spent on Guam, because the USGS Invasive Reptiles Project pays separately for use of facilities on Guam. Most incoming agreements include some funds to be spent at FORT and some on Guam, and therefore the final indirect rate
41

depends on the proportion of the overall funding to be spent at each location, as well as whether funds are coming from DOI or non-DOI sources. It should be emphasized that these estimates only cover base costs and do not include project specific costs, such as those for the development of the AABS.
5.0 CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS
Over the almost 30-year course of BTS management and research, the dedicated efforts of administrators, managers, and biologists have achieved the principal goal of the BTS TWG: preventing the BTS from escaping Guam and repeating the ecological disaster elsewhere. This is attributable to the ingenuity of the researchers studying the BTS and developing tools to capture and kill snakes, as well as the rigorous efforts of biologists, trappers, and dog handlers conducting interdiction on Guam, CNMI, and Hawaii. It is also due to federal, territorial, and state governments recognizing the threat the BTS poses to the interests of the U.S. and providing valuable assistance in the form of legislation and funding. Also, the ability to suppress the BTS over large areas, the precursor to restoration of native species on Guam, has shown promise in recent trials of new methods. With continued funding the AABS should be operational within two to three years. Once this tool is operational, the BTS TWG can begin the steps toward restoring some native species to Guam. The third goal of the BTS TWG, eradication of snakes from Guam, remains outside the time frame of this five-year Plan.
To continue advancing in the coming decade BTS TWG must contend with several issues. The scope and scale of the BTS TWG has grown in response to the magnitude of the problem of managing BTS across the Pacific. With this growth have come issues related to the management of information. These problems are manageable and must be addressed in order to evaluate the efficacy of BTS interdiction efforts. Progress needs to be made by the BTS TWG and its partner agencies to address data management and the tracking of funds. Better organization and oversight will only take the BTS TWG so far. To move beyond perpetual targeted interdiction, toward the goal of large-scale control of the BTS and an eventual repatriation of extirpated species on Guam, stable long-term funding is essential. The funding analysis (Figure 8) clearly shows that financial support for the BTS TWG has increased greatly over the past decades. It also illustrates that the majority of the increased support has funded WS and their interdiction and control efforts, which has helped build a program capable of achieving near 100% inspections of out-going cargo from Guam, which is likely attributable, in part, to the decrease in extralimital sightings of snakes. Funding for research has not kept pace with that of interdiction, and while absolute funding levels are important, stability of support is critical. Pursuing solutions to problems as vexing as those posed by the BTS RC (Table 2) will require methodical and incremental research, which is dependent on consistent, dedicated funding over periods of multiple years. Below is a list of recommendations addressing issues related to data management, programmatic needs (see section 3.2 “Technical Working Group Assessment” for more detail), and the manner in which funds are provided for operations and research.
42

5. 1 DATA & INFORMATION RECOMMENDATIONS
Snake Sighting Database – The database of extra-limital snake sights has recently undergone a verification check and the credibility of each sighting evaluated. The database should now be linked to a website, which should be managed by the USFWS-PIFWO. This would ensure that the most up-to-date information on snake sightings is available to all BTS TWG partners.
BTS-caused Power Outages – Guam Power Authority (GPA) contracts with WS to reduce BTS numbers around several substations and transmission lines. However, it is unknown whether this effort is causing a reduction in the number of power outages or if BTS-caused outages remain a significant problem on Guam. GPA records should be analyzed by WS (or a contractor) to assess the effect of on BTS control efforts on power outages and to examine the current impact of snakes on power generation on Guam.
Funding & Expenditure Tracking – As part of this Plan, BTS management costs were analyzed. This posthoc analysis was complicated by the temporal extent of management and the variety of funders and even greater number of recipients. USFWS should maintain a ledger for all recipients of BTS funding and the system should be updated annually.
5.2 PROGRAMMATIC RECOMMENDATIONS
In addition to administrative issues, there are programmatic shortcomings that must be addressed for the BTS TWG to operate more efficiently and to prevent the BTS from establishing outside of Guam. Most of the below programmatic needs are or would be directly dependent on a funding increase to implement. HDOA Canine Inspection Program – Hawaii has been without a canine inspection program since 2009 leaving it vulnerable to a BTS arriving undetected. This is despite OIA providing funding since 2010. If HDOA is unable to reestablish its program by the end of calendar year 2015, alternative strategies to implement interdiction should be strongly considered, foremost contracting with WS to manage the Hawaii BTS inspection program.
CNMI DFW Interdiction Program Performance – Administrative and operational deficiencies continue to hinder the CNMI DFW Interdiction Program. If CNMI DFW cannot demonstrate the ability to maintain program effectiveness by the end of calendar year 2015, alternative strategies to conduct interdiction should be strongly considered, foremost contracting with WS to implement BTS interdiction in the CNMI.
RRT Training & Protocols – BTS RRT search training has not been conducted since early 2012. Many RRT searchers require refresher courses and new BTS personnel training. RRT training should be provided sufficient support FY2015 to address the need to provide refresher and initial training to personnel.
43

RRT Protocols – Some RRT protocols and guidelines are incomplete. In 2014, the RRT Coordinator should complete the draft Brown Treesnake Rapid Response Team Searcher Manual. In the Manual, should be guidelines for developing and implementing an incident command system for high-risk areas in the Pacific.
Disaster planning – Tropical storms have hit Guam and diminished the capacity to conduct interdiction. WS has developed standard operating procedures to deal with future storms. Funding is required to implement these procedures and ensure interdiction capacity for future storms.
The Brown Treesnake Control and Eradication Act of 2004 Reauthorization – The Brown Treesnake Control and Eradication Act of 2004 expired in 2010. It provided a clear structure for BTS TWG and defined federal agency roles related to BTS management; however, some provisions were not adequately funded. A reauthorized and strengthened Brown Treesnake Control and Eradication Act of 2004 could provide stronger federal legal authority for BTS interdiction. BTS TWG Partners (federal, state, and territorial) should work together to determine mechanisms to reauthorize the Brown Treesnake Control and Eradication Act of 2004. Two components that should be considered are: which agencies, departments, or bureaus should be added to the Brown Treesnake Control and Eradication Act of 2004, and which mechanisms should be added to it to strengthen BTS quarantine.
Standardize QA (Quality Assessment) BTS Operational Programs – WS, CNMI DFW, and HDOA, in coordination with USFWS, should collaborate to develop protocols to standardize the QA of BTS interdiction programs to ensure outgoing and incoming cargo and vehicles receive the same level inspection.
Container Inspection Tracking / Certification – WS should work with the Port Authority of Guam, the Guam Airport Authority, and freight forwarders to ensure that containers, once inspected, are not reopened, creating a breach in the inspection process. PAG has stated it will work with all cooperating entities involved in the BTS inspection process to ensure this problem is adequately addressed (USFWS; PAG 2013).
5.3 BASE FUNDING RECOMMENDATIONS
Two of the programmatic needs require an increase in funding and a restructuring in the manner in which funds are provided. WS Interdiction Program Funding – In 2011, the WS program on Guam lost most base programmatic funding from USDA. Currently, the WS interdiction program on Guam is primarily supported via reimbursable funds from DOI and DoD. Secure base funding versus year-to-year funding is needed to ensure long-term viability of interdiction on Guam.
44

USGS & NWRC Research & Methods Development Base Funding – Conducting BTS research and methods development solely on intermittent grants is inefficient and impacts programs. Staffing continuity is reduced, costs are inflated because of the need to use contractors, and it strategically restricts researchers from planning multi-year projects. Stable base funding is needed to overcome these limitations.
