Stemborer ifit damage contained, research ongoing

‘ONE NEW PEST EVERY MONTH:’ One of two species under the genus Cryptophlebia, an invasive stemborer on Guam causing damage to ifit trees. Photo courtesy of Dr. Aubrey Moore

While the damage to 40 ifit seedlings at the Department of Agriculture's Mangilao nursery has been contained, entomologist Aubrey Moore said the possibly invasive stemborer that appeared in May could be running rampant – out of eyesight from environment officials.

Regarding the ifit seedlings, officials said the stemborer attacks the soft tissue of seedlings, whereas in older plants they are known to attack the growing tips.

Although the department has grown ifit trees in its other nurseries, they just started growing ifit seedlings in Mangilao fairly recently.

Shortly after the outbreak, Department of Agriculture staff treated the ifit with insecticide.

Samples sent off-island for testing showed the insects could be one of two species under the genus Cryptophlebia.

“It’s either a species that’s already been here for a long time, or a species from the same genus only found in Hawaii,” said Moore. “I tend to think it’s the latter. The Department of Agriculture has been growing ifit for a long time, so they would have seen it before, and we get stuff in from Hawaii all the time.”

“The work isn’t completely done, but the genus has at least been confirmed,” Moore said.

Moore estimates that at least one new pest arrives on Guam each month from sister islands.

But regardless, in both cases, stemborers have a broad host range, which means they can live off a wide variety of plants and are not restricted to the ifit, Guam’s territorial tree.

“The lingering question for me is, ‘What’s happening to our plants in the wild?’ I’m almost completely certain it’s out there already,” Moore said.

Studies are still being conducted to determine, for certain, which of the two species the stemborer belongs to.

While the immediate threat to the ifit has been subdued, the events characterize the fragility of Guam’s ecosystem, and the ripple effect invasive species, foraging pigs and deer have on the environment.

“Pigs especially – they eat young seedlings, and pretty much anything out in the wild,” said Ruddy Estoy, a forester with the agriculture department.

With time and resources, Moore said a delimiting survey must be done to determine the reach of the stemborer. Moore is one of just three entomologists on island.
