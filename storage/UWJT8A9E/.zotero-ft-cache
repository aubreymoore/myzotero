Green waste from Typhoon Dolphin to be disposed of, finally

More than 13,000 cubic yards of green waste collected more than seven months ago will soon be disposed of now that contractors have signed off on a procurement award for an air-curtain burning and a wood-chip composting job.

Contractor Buena Vista Environmental LLC was awarded $100,000 for the chipping and composting disposal project and Pacific Unlimited Inc. was awarded the air-curtain burning project, according to procurement documents. Unlike the award for Buena Vista, General Services Agency documents did not show the amount awarded to Pacific Unlimited Inc.

The bids were awarded by the Office of Homeland Security, which is the regulatory agency in charge of distributing grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

In August, Department of Public Works Director Glenn Leon Guerrero said FEMA would provide up to 75 percent of the cost of collecting and disposing of green waste after Typhoon Dolphin struck the island.

About 11,000 cubic yards of waste was collected on roads by DPW after the typhoon, Leon Guerrero said in an earlier interview. Leon Guerrero said then that about 27,000 cubic yards was collected and members of the Mayors’ Council of Guam collected the remaining 16,500 cubic yards of waste.

In the wake of Typhoon Dolphin, the government allowed residents to burn excess green waste if they received a permit from the Guam Fire Department.

Alternative sites

As an alternative, three sites were designated as drop-off points for green waste: Ija in Inarajan, a site on Wusstig Road in Dededo and at the old hospital area at Ypao Point in Tamuning.

Since May, the waste has been awaiting disposal through environmentally friendly means, which is the reason for the air-curtain burner and composting invitations for bid.

The bid listed 13,750 cubic yards of green waste from the Ypao Point and Ija sites as the amount of waste to be chipped and composted. In addition, 13,750 cubic yards of waste from the Tamuning and Inarajan sites will be disposed of by air curtain burning.

Procurement documents show a 90-day timeline from the day the purchase order is delivered until the job is to be completed.

Department of Public Works Deputy Director Felix Benavente was unavailable for additional comment yesterday.

Air curtain burning, according to the Guam Environmental Protection Agency, is a method of burning that uses a curtain of air flowing over a fire that is confined inside a container. GEPA partnered with the National Park Service in 2014 for an air-curtain burner pilot project with the intent of limiting the spread of the invasive coconut rhinoceros beetle and the little fire ant.

Green waste is of particular concern for authorities because it is the preferred breeding site for the coconut rhinoceros beetle, an invasive species that has marred countless coconut trees throughout the island.

The site in Tamuning was treated for little fire ants last year and a netting to trap the rhino beetles attracted to the green waste can be seen covering the pile at Ypao Point.
