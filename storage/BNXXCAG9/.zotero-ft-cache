Guam Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle Eradication Project
SPLAT Bioassay 1: Toxicity of SPLAT Containing 5% Cypermethrin to Adult
Coconut Rhinoceros Beetles
Prepared by Aubrey Moore University of Guam Cooperative Extension Service February 16, 2011
This ﬁrst bioassay tests for toxic eﬀects to adult CRB after brief tarsal contact with RB-SPLAT containing 5% cypermetherin (RB-SPLAT-C).
1 Methods
CRB adults were ﬁeld collected from a compost pile on January 27, 2011. Beetles were held individually one quart Mason jars containing moist peat moss. At 2:00 p.m. on January 31, 2010, each beetle was removed from its jar, lowered onto a plastic surface coated with a thin layer of RB-SPLAT-C for 10 seconds so that all legs contacted the material, and then placed back in its jar. Beetles were checked at 24 hours and 48 hours after treatment.
2 Results
All ten treated beetles were knocked down within 24 h and none recovered within the following week (Table 1).
