DoAg Demonstration Farm
For over 8 years the Guam Department of Agriculture: Agriculture Development Services (ADS) has run a demonstration farm managed under organic practices in Mangilao.
This farm has grown many fruits and vegetables successfully
 Each May we hold a field day with lunch and open the farm to the public.
Over the years we have encountered many pest problems and have work with many control options.
Today we will discuss some of these controls with an applied focus

Weed Control
For weed control a whole range of practices have been utilized on the farm.
Mulching (especially with shredded paper) has been a front line method of weed suppression.
This is especially important in new plantings.
We have also utilized cover crops, green manures and living mulches like; sun hemp, red velvet bean and sweet potato to both build the soil and fill an ecological niche so weed
Mowing and maintenance of natural plant covers
Use of plastic mulch
Note that the plastic mulch must be removed annually.

Insect Control
Monitoring to know what insect pest and beneficial insects you have is critical.
We do visual inspections of our crops regularly and we utilize sticky traps (yellow cups covered with sticky glue)
When a pest is found, we do not always apply a control. In small numbers it is better to just let the natural systems control the pest, only when we see a large outbreak do we apply a control.
As part of the visual inspect, on a small scale we will simply apply the mechanical control of crushing the pest as we find them.
Another mechanical control we often use is floating row covers to protect crops from insects that can transmit diseases.
These are used both in the nursery to protect seedlings and in the field with crops like watermelon.

Insect Control continued
For soft bodied insects (aphids & mealy bugs) we utilize insecticidal soaps like Safer soap and horticultural oils.
Soap/Oil Spray https://oklahoman.com/article/2388013/soap-sprays-hel p-control-many-plant-pests
For certain Lepidoptera and other pests we will use a bacterial control Bacillus thuringiensis (Dipel).
Less frequently we will use Neam oil spray which is a more broad spectrum spray (it can kill your beneficial insects)
Of course we start the crop right by selecting the best adapted variety for our island. These well adapted plants are better able to resist pests

Disease Control
Disease control starts with selecting appropriate variety for disease resistance.
We utilize windbreaks on our farm to minimize physical damage (which provides entry point to diseases) to our plants, by winds.
We also try to maintain open air flow throughout our production areas by not planting plants to close.
We practice crop rotations to reduce the buildup of disease associated with a particular plant family.
We utilize mulch to prevent rain water splashing soil particles carrying disease onto the plants.
We also maintain crop sanitation by composting crop residues.
