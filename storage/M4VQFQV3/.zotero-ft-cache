Background

The pink hibiscus mealybug (PHM), Maconellicoccus hirsutus (Green), is a serious economic threat to agriculture, forestry, and the nursery industry. This pest attacks many plants, trees, and shrubs. It infests hibiscus, citrus, coffee, sugar cane, annonas, plums, guava, mango, okra, sorrel, teak, mora, pigeon pea, peanut, grape, maize, asparagus, chrysanthemum, beans, cotton, soybean, and cocoa, just to name a few of its hosts. For a comprehensive list of host plants, see Appendix A.
This pest occurs in most tropical areas of the world including Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, and Oceania. PHM arrived in Egypt from India in 1912 and in Hawaii in 1984. Finally, it appeared in Grenada, Trinidad, and St. Kitts in the early 1990’s. It is now a very serious pest in the Caribbean, found on at least 16 islands including the U.S. Virgin Islands, where it attacks many economically important hosts and disrupts Caribbean agricultural trade and commerce.

Introduction: Orientation Biological Control Project Against PHM
Biological Control Project Against PHM
The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is charged with protecting American agriculture from exotic plant pests like PHM. APHIS considers PHM a pest of extremely serious quarantine importance that has the potential to expand its geographical distribution to North, Central, and South America. Two units of APHIS, Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), and International Services (IS), are cooperating in a biological control project aimed at controlling PHM in the Caribbean. This project will serve as a model to start a biological control program in the mainland U.S. when PHM arrives. The purpose of this manual is to guide USDA personnel and cooperators (see page 1-12) in setting up and maintaining these biological control programs.
Description of the Insect
The adult PHM is about 2-3 mm long. Females are oval shaped, wingless, and covered by a mass of white mealy wax. Males have one pair of wings, two long waxy tails, and can fly. For a more detailed description (Hall, 1921) modified for field use, refer to the subsection Distinguishing Field Characters on page 2-9. See also the insert following page 2.8 for color photographs of PHM.
Systematic Position
The taxonomic classification of PHM is summarized as follows:
Phylum: Arthropoda Class: Insecta Order: Homoptera Family: Pseudococcidae Genus: Maconellicoccus Species: Maconellicoccus hirsutus (Green)
Williams (1996) has recently reviewed M. hirsutus taxonomically. Ezzat (1958) separates the genus Maconellicoccus from Paracoccus, the closest known relatives, by the following features in the adult female:
N Pseudo articulation in the 9th (terminal) antennal joint
N Anterior leg with unequal tarsal digitules
N Small oral collar tubular ducts present on both the dorsal and ventral sides of the body

Introduction: Orientation Biology/Ecology
PHM is one of apparently nine species in Maconellicoccus. The genus is probably Far Eastern, possibly of tropical Australian origin, as five of nine species are found there. Of those five species, three have become adapted to a more moderate subtropical climate, especially M. tasmaniae, found only in temperate Tasmania. In Africa, there are only two species, including the PHM, which may have spread there recently. The other species, M. ugandae, has a strictly tropical African distribution (Williams, 1985 and 1986). M. australiensis (Green & Lidgett), M. lanigerus (Fuller), M. leptospermi Williams, M. hirsutus (Green) and M. tasmaniae Williams all occur in Australia; M. multipori (Takahashi) in Malaysia and M. ramchensis sp. n. M. pasaniae in Nepal (Williams, 1996).
PHM is the only species with a worldwide distribution. It probably spread to Africa along tropical routes from the oriental region. Some of this spread is recent: Egypt, 1908 (Williams, 1986); Hawaii, 1984 (NPAG, 1984); and the West Indies in 1994 (Pollard, 1995).
Biology/Ecology
PHM is a small, soft-bodied insect with a nonflying female and a flying male. The intermediate life stages, illustrated in Figure 1-1 on page 1-5, are eggs and three (female) or four (male) nymphal instars. The female lays its eggs in ovisacs, which it deposits on the host, sometimes in great numbers and visible as a whitish covering over the terminal parts or even main areas of the host. The female, the nymphal stages and the male, if present, are very visible on the host as well. All stages are reddish to pink in color, but covered in white mealy wax, with the body color showing through. For that reason it is often called the pink hibiscus mealybug.

Introduction: Orientation Biology/Ecology
Natural Protection
The natural wax coating covering the various stages of the PHM provides some protection from pesticides. This is especially true of the egg stage, which is protected by a white, waxy ovisac. The ovisac is almost impossible to penetrate with many pesticides (McKenzie, 1967).
The PHM’s ability to hide in cracks and crevices is probably the most important means by which it protects itself. Once hidden, reaching it by both natural enemies and humans is difficult (McKenzie, 1967).
Some sugar-loving ants will protect the PHM from parasites and predators. The ant, Monomorium indicum, was observed in India attending the nymphs and maturing females for their honeydew. They do not attend to male nymphs in the last nymphal stage nor to gravid females that have begun laying eggs because they no longer produce honeydew (Misra, 1920).
Reproduction and Development
Mani (1989) reports that males are very common, but parthenogenetic reproduction has been reported in the literature. Overall, researchers assume reproduction is restricted to the sexual form with the sex ratio approximately 1:1. From 84 to 654 mealybug eggs are laid in a loose cottony terminal white ovisac. They are in close contact with each other within the ovisac. Eggs turn pink before they hatch, 3–8 days after being laid.
Newly hatched mealybugs (crawlers or first instar nymphs) are mobile. They settle on the host and start their development, which lasts 10 to 22 days. Although they prefer the apical and tender regions of the host, under field conditions the older plant parts, including stems, leaves, petioles, roots, tubers, and even the pods, may harbor large populations of the crawlers (Ghose, 1972). Male and female nymphs are distinguishable by the end of the second instar. The male has four instars of 6.60 ± 0.50 days, 6.51 ± 0.51 days, one day, and 5.59 ± 0.69 days each, while the females have three instars of 6.71 ± 0.47 days, 6.55 ± 0.52 days and 7.9 ± 0.79 days. At the end of the second instar, males produce cottony cocoons (puparia) (Mani 1989).
Females are wingless and dark pink. They migrate to the lower parts of the host as the affected apical portions wither away (Ghose, 1972). Preoviposition is from 0.5 to 6 days, followed by an ovipositional period of 4 to 8 days. Oviposition normally occurs in the terminal areas of the host, but when the weather gets cooler, the females search for shelter to oviposit. These include crevices in the bark (of a tree) or other shelter on the host (Hall, 1926). Activity on roots has been reported in a few cases, but the circumstances are not clear (Rao & Srinivasan, 1987; Hall, 1921; Hosny, 1939).

Damage

Introduction: Orientation Damage
There are about 10 generations a year in the subtropics. If there is a winter season, PHM will hibernate or remain quiescent in any or all of its stages until food plants are again available. The pest may overwinter in protected parts of the host such as the capsules of kenaf or sorrel, cracks and crevices of bark, inside fruit bunches or in the soil. Maximum populations are reached in late summer and early fall.
Although PHM by itself is not greatly mobile, the crawlers, ovisacs, and males may migrate by means of air currents. The females, crawlers, and nymphs are mobile and can walk from host to host in the infested area. Males are probably attracted to the female over several hundred meters at best (Misra, 1920) and seem to stay within the infested area as well.
The PHM’s toxic saliva and direct feeding may cause various symptoms in the host plants. These symptoms are generally severe malformation of shoots and leaves. Leaves become twisted and crinkled. Growth becomes stunted and shoot tips have a bushy appearance. Infested flowers dry and drop and fruits are not produced. Infested fruits are small and abnormally shaped, and may drop early, thus reducing production and marketability (Francis-Ellis, 1995).
Specific hosts may exhibit symptoms as in the following examples:
N In hibiscus, PHM usually infests young twigs (Figure 1-2), causing gall-like deformations of the terminal growth. This is characterized by internode shortening or “Bunchy Top” (Figure 1-3), deformed leaves and thickened twigs (Veni, et al, 1973; Beardsley, 1985). Heavy infestations can result in leaf defoliation, stunted leaves, and death of the plant (Figure 1-4).

Introduction: Orientation Damage
N In mulberry, the shoots of the affected plant first turn coppery-green, then pale-yellow and finally become so hard, compact, and brittle that they cannot be opened without breaking. The lower lateral leaves become seared and fall off prematurely. In severe attacks, nothing but the bare stems of plants remain in the field (Misra, 1920).
N In roselle, floral branching is suppressed, the tips are gradually withered and the floral buds are reduced and distorted. This results in a drastic reduction in seed loss—about 21–43 percent of normal production, due to a reduction in the number and quality of the pods (Ghose, 1971).
N In cotton, the growing parts are attacked resulting in bunchy-type symptoms. Attacked plants remain stunted and produce fewer bolls of a smaller size. Boll opening is adversely affected and yield reduction ranges from 58–73 percent (Dhawan, 1980). It is recorded, but rare on the roots of cotton plants under severely attacked trees (Hosny, 1939).
N In grapevine, PHM feeds on the developing sprouts after pruning and stunts their growth. The growing shoots and the leaves are malformed due to sticky honeydew produced by the pest, predisposing them to moldy growth and bunching. Heavily infested bunches shrivel and drop. Damage can be as much as 90 percent occasionally (Babu & Azam, 1987).
N In peanut, PHM feeds on the underground parts of the roots, pods, and pegs of the plant. This results in stunted growth and poorly developed pegs and pods (Rao & Srinivasan, 1987).
N In trees, PHM feeds on tender young growth, although this can change to older growth if the infestation is high. This results in malformed leaves and shoots, which become gnarled and form compact heads. As a result, dieback of young shoots and limbs may occur resulting in eventual death of the tree. Some trees may be very obviously infected and covered with PHM, emitting a distinctive odor (Hall, 1921; ANON., 1995; Hall, 1926).
N In other hosts, symptoms may vary, but dieback of attacked areas often results. Death of the host, including large trees, is very common (Figure 1-5).

Introduction: Orientation Economic Losses

Economic Losses
In many countries, this pest is chiefly restricted to Hibiscus and is not of concern, possibly because it is kept in check by natural enemies. In some areas of India and Egypt, however, it is a serious pest of some important crops, especially where no natural controls are present. In these countries it does seem to have many hosts, but of these hosts few are heavily attacked. When this mealybug turned up in Hawaii in 1984, it did not become a problem because natural enemies were apparently fortuitously introduced with it. In the Caribbean islands where natural enemies were absent, it became a very serious problem, attacking many plants and disrupting the agricultural sector to a major extent causing significant financial losses. Grenada reported economic losses of $3.5 to $10 million for the 1996/97 season, and Trinidad and Tobago estimate potential losses exceeding $125 million/year if infestations continue to escalate.

Geographic Distribution
PHM seems native to southern Asia (Williams, 1996) as based on its distribution and that of members of the genus Maconellicoccus. It is the only species with a virtually worldwide distribution in tropical areas of the world from Australia through Southeast Asia, the Middle East and central Africa. It has recently spread to Guam, Hawaii, and the Caribbean. Since its discovery in Grenada in November 1994, it has been found in Trinidad in August 1995, and St. Kitts & Nevis in November 1995. For maps showing world and Caribbean distribution, and a list of infested islands and countries in the Caribbean, see Introduction.

Host Range

PHM attacks more than 200 genera of plants in 70 different families. Many of these are economically important representatives of the following groups:
N Forest trees N Fruit trees N Ornamentals N Root crops N Vegetables
For an extensive list of hosts recorded with damaging populations of PHM, see Appendix A.

Introduction: Orientation Biological Control
Any local survey needs to take into account both the host list given in Appendix A, and local plant species that may be hosts. PHM changes host preferences by locality, perhaps as a reflection of changes in habitat, environment, and interactions with the local flora/fauna/ predator/parasite complex. Surveyors should design a local host list based on actual local finds.
Biological Control
Biological control, when considered from the ecological viewpoint as a phase of natural control, can be defined as “the action of parasites, predators, or pathogens in maintaining another organism’s population density at a lower average than would occur in their absence” (DeBach, 1964). Biological control of PHM is the best long-term solution, since pesticides are not effective. Natural enemies can control the pest in a way that is safe to humans and the environment.
Types of Natural Enemies
Overall, natural enemies are classified as one of the following types based on how they control the target pest:
N Parasite: Completes its growth and development on or in a single host, killing that host in the process
N Predator: Finds and kills a number of prey to complete growth and development
N Pathogen: Controls the pest by causing a fatal disease that spreads to other host individuals (includes bacteria, fungi, and viruses)
Many exotic natural enemies have been reported in the literature and are under consideration for importation and release to regulate PHM in the Caribbean (see Appendix C).
These four natural enemies have been released in St. Kitts and Nevis:
Parasites (tiny wasps)
N Anagyrus kamali (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) N Gyranusoidea indica (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae)
Predators (lady beetles)
N Cryptolaemus montrouzieri (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) N Scymnus coccivora (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae)

Purpose

The purpose of surveying for PHM is to decide if a local population of the pest is present. If you detect the presence of PHM either by visual survey or by pheromone trapping, you should plan to begin releasing natural enemies. First, follow the procedures in this section for surveying. If the results of your survey are positive, then refer to the sections on insectary operation and releasing natural enemies. Detailed survey techniques are also discussed by Jeffrey Stibick (1997) in the New Pest Response Guidelines for the Pink Hibiscus Mealybug.

Surveying for PHM
Visual

Visual survey is the most effective style of survey at this time. The most common hosts found infested in the Caribbean are Acacia spp., cotton, hibiscus, seaside grape, and soursop. By examining these common hosts at residential sites, hotels, other commercial property or open fields and along the seashore, you will easily see PHM on these plants if infested.

Procedure

Look closely at the terminals on hibiscus, Acacia spp. and cotton, the fruit on soursop, and the junction of leaves and stem and leaf veins on seaside grape. To help identify PHM, refer to the following inserts for keys and color photographs. The white waxy covering of the various mealybug instars and white waxy filaments in the egg mass allow for easy detection. Rolling the terminal stem over sometimes reveals protective niches in which the mealybug may be residing. In heavy infestations, large quantities of egg masses may be present on the bark and main trunk of host plants such as saman, soursop, and hibiscus.
When surveyors find suspicious mealybugs that appear to have the typical field characteristics discussed in the subsection beginning on page 2-14, send the specimens to a qualified taxonomist for positive identification. If the taxonomist confirms that the specimens are PHM, appropriate authorities will then announce a formal country (county or state) notification of positive identification.
Step 1—Fill a screw-cap vial with 70 percent ethyl or isopropyl alcohol.
Step 2—Remove adult female mealybugs (and other instars if present) from the infested terminals, twigs, or branches using a small brush or probe.
Step 3—Place the mealybugs in the vial containing 70 percent alcohol.
Step 4—On Form PHM-1 (Appendix H) or a small paper label, record in pencil the date, location, host plant from which you collected the mealybugs, your name, and the tentative identification. Place the label inside the vial and cap the vial. Do not use ink—most inks dissolve in alcohol.

Sex Pheromone Traps

The female PHM releases a sex pheromone to attract the male for mating (Figure 2-1). Sex pheromone traps lure the male PHM by releasing a chemical attractant (sex pheromone), either natural or synthetic, into the air. These traps may be two types:
N A trap that uses live virgin females
N A trap that uses a synthetic sex pheromone
These traps can be useful in indexing the population density of PHM in a local area. They can also be used for delimiting surveys to show presence or absence of PHM, but this requires the laborious task of identifying trapped males.

Surveying for PHM: Sex Pheromone Traps Procedure

Procedure

Virgin Female Trap
If sex pheromone traps with live virgin females are available, a delimiting survey could consist of setting 32 to 36 traps/mi2 (12 to 14 traps/km2) in the core host plant areas in places where the traps will be safe. Trained survey personnel must have access to a key (currently under development) for identifying male PHM.
Use one trap per study site to determine the relative population density index at that site and average with other sites as appropriate.
These traps may consist of a pint-size (½-liter) paper carton modified to hold a sprouted potato with 10 or more new virgin females (Figure 2-2). The trap has a vented top made of fine mesh cloth, allowing movement of the sex pheromone out of the trap to attract adult males.

Surveying for PHM: Sex Pheromone Traps Procedure
A wire clip and trap holder (Figure 2-3) support a 3 in x 5 in (7.6 cm x 12.7 cm) white plastic sticky card covered with tangle foot. Suspend the trap about 4–6 ft (1.2–1.8 m) above the ground close to the host plants (Figure 2-4). You can leave the trap in the field for 4 weeks and change the trap card weekly. Count male PHM on each card. This count represents a relative index of the population density of PHM at that site.

FIGURE 2-3: Sex pheromone trap showing FIGURE 2-4: Servicing sex pheromone

Synthetic Sex Pheromone Trap
Although not currently available for PHM, synthetic sex pheromones have been developed for the citrus mealybug and Comstock mealybug.

If a synthetic sex pheromone becomes available for PHM, set the traps out in a standard grid pattern within core and buffer areas. Service the traps weekly by changing the sticky card, and replace the traps monthly.

Using a dissecting microscope, count all males on each card and record data weekly on Form PHM-2 (Appendix H). The data will serve as a population density index for PHM. Keeping weekly counts of trapped males is an excellent way to track population trends and impact of natural enemies over time from their initial release.

Introduction

For accurate identification of PHM, use the following procedure developed by Doug Odermatt, Coccoidea specialist, PPQ. While this is not the only method, it provides a permanent mount, and may be the fastest way to clear, stain, and mount a specimen. For better clearing, boil the mealybugs in water or ethanol before preserving in ethanol.

Preparing Slides
Step 1—To clear, heat in a 10 percent potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution at 140 °–150 °F (60 °–66 °C) for about 15 minutes. Puncture larger specimens with an insect pin or make a small slit on the side of the abdomen before heating. Premix the KOH in a ratio of about 14 pellets per 50 ml of distilled water. If time is not critical, clear the specimen in cold KOH overnight. Check the calibration of your hot plate with a thermometer in a water bath.
Step 2—Use a spatula to pump out the body contents of the specimen until it is transparent. This is the most critical step. Briefly reheat in KOH if needed. Also, try a higher temperature if needed.
Step 3—Rinse in distilled water.
Step 4—Stain in acid fuchsin or double stain (with lignin pink). Leave specimens in stain at least 15 minutes (much longer is acceptable). Another recommended fluid for clearing/staining is Essig’s aphid fluid containing stain.
Step 5—Rinse in 70 percent ethanol, then 95 percent ethanol.
Step 6—Transfer to clove oil until clear. Any remaining wax should disappear during this step. You may leave specimens in clove oil overnight.
Step 7—Place the specimen on a slide in a drop of Canada Balsam. Histoclear is a safe thinner for balsam. Arrange the specimens with anterior end toward you. Cover with a cover slip.

Refer to Figure 2-11 for an illustration of the general morphology of an adult female mealybug (from Williams, 1996). Compare this illustration to Figure 2-12, Maconellicoccus hirsutus, and the following description of the adult female PHM (also from Williams, 1996):
Description
Adult female. Appearance in life described as orange pink to reddish, sparsely covered with white mealy wax but the insects become completely buried in the white ovisac material. Slide-mounted specimens up to 3.8 mm long, 2.1 mm wide; anal lobes poorly to moderately developed, each with a ventral anal lobe bar expanding towards apex and an apical seta 250–330 µm long. Antennae each usually 380–470 µm long with 9 segments. Legs well developed; hind trochanter+femur usually 300–350 µm long, rarely reduced to 280–290 µm long, hind tibia+tarsus normally 310–370 µm long, rarely only 280–300 µm long, claw stout, 35.0–37.5 µm long. Ratio of lengths of hind tibia+tarsus to hind trochanter+femur 1.00–1.16. Ratio of lengths of hind tibia to tarsus 2.30–2.60. Translucent pores present on hind femur and hind tibia, those on hind femur sometimes few and not easily apparent. Labium 150–165 µm long, about same length as clypeolabral shield. Circulus normally 85–150 µm wide, varying considerably in shape from almost quadrate to oval, usually with weak constrictions laterally and sometimes divided by an intersegmental line but this line not apparent in many specimens. Ostioles well developed, the inner edges of lips moderately sclerotized, each lip with 1–3 setae and a few trilocular pores but with marked variation. Anal ring 80–95 µm wide with 6 setae, each 125–150 µm long. Cerarii usually numbering 4–6 pairs, rarely 7 pairs. Anal lobe cerarii each with 2 conical setae, each seta about 20 µm long, and a few trilocular pores all situated on a membranous area. Anterior cerarii often similar but anteriormost cerarii sometimes reduced to a single seta or one or both setae replaced by flagellate setae.
Dorsal surface with thick flagellate setae. Multilocular disc pores absent. Trilocular pores evenly distributed. Discoidal pores minute, sparse. Oral rim tubular ducts numerous, usually each 4–5 µm in diameter, but sometimes narrower, 3.75 µm wide, 7.5–8.5 µm long, the rim about 10 µm in diameter. Oral collar tubular ducts each narrower than a trilocular pore and about 7.5 µm long, present across the middle of segments in more or less single rows but sometimes reduced to only one or two on each segment.

Ventral surface with normal flagellate setae, similar to those on dorsum but usually longer. Multilocular disc pores each about 8.75 µm in diameter, distributed across the anterior and posterior edges of abdominal segment IV and posterior segments, often reaching submargins; sometimes present on abdominal segment III and rarely on medial area of head. Trilocular pores present in an even distribution. Discoidal pores sparse. Oral rim tubular ducts similar to those on dorsum, present around margins of thorax and anterior abdominal segments. Oral collar tubular ducts of two sizes. A large type, narrower than a trilocular pore and about 10 µm long, is present in transverse rows on abdominal segments III–VI and around lateral margins of all abdominal segments; others are scattered in medial and marginal areas of the thorax. A small type of duct, similar to those on the dorsum, is distributed mainly across middle of abdominal segments and mingled with the large type on margins; others are present in small numbers on head and thorax.

Operating the Insectary: Introduction Purpose

Purpose

To rear parasites and predators, it is a necessity to propagate or acquire the optimum host plant for rearing the mealybug in a laboratory. You can use suitable potted plants that are hosts to PHM, but propagating and maintaining these types of plants requires considerable greenhouse space, special lighting inside the laboratory, and a sizable workforce. Occasionally, a fruit or vegetable can be substituted as the host plant substrate of choice for an insectary operation for mass producing an insect. The Japanese pumpkin (chirimen variety) is such a host and is the host of choice for this program. You can also use Russet or other white potatoes as a backup host if sprouts can be grown and maintained for several months. These host plants are easy to maintain and manipulate. Potatoes are held in the dark for storage and sprouting, and both potatoes and pumpkins are held in the dark to effectively rear the mealybug. These infested hosts are then placed in a single- or double-holed sleeve cage for predator and parasite mass production in the insectary.
Insectary operators must understand that they have to deal with a total of three trophic levels in this insectary operation:
N The host plant
N The mealybug
N The predators or parasites that feed on or parasitize the mealybug
To successfully rear and release adequate numbers of natural enemies, you must adequately produce and maintain all three trophic levels. Keeping these trophic levels free from contamination is an important aspect of operating the insectary. To prevent contamination, be sure to follow the procedures in the next subsection, Following the Mandatory Work Pathway Protocol. Locate the insectary site in an infested area if possible, to prevent establishment of this pest in uninfested regions.

Following the Mandatory Work Pathway Protocol
To prevent premature contamination of the host plant material with PHM and contamination of the PHM culture with natural enemies, you must carefully define the work pathway and follow a specific protocol.

Operating the Insectary: Introduction Following the Mandatory Work Pathway Protocol
Host Plant Material
The first work of the day should be with the host plant material. This may consist of the following activities:
N Working in the field harvesting pumpkins and transporting them for treatment and storage
N Examining the host plant material in storage and culling host material that is decaying
N Selecting host plant material for the week and/or day’s use
Do NOT work with the PHM or natural enemy cultures before working with uninfested host plant material!
Important
Some staff may need to dedicate half a day to the host plant material while others may only help for an hour and go on to the next level of activity, which would be working with the PHM culture. Anyone who has worked with the PHM culture never returns to work on the pumpkins or potatoes for that day and never enters the host plant storage area.
PHM Culture
Once workers finish the host plant work for the day, they may go on to work at the next trophic level, such as working with the PHM culture. Do not work on natural enemy cultures before working in the PHM insectary. To avoid contamination, do not enter the natural enemy insectary, handle field releases, or allow exposure to field material before working with the PHM culture. Open the natural enemy culture room only after completing all PHM culture work and securing and locking the rooms.
Natural Enemies
The last events of the day consist of working with the natural enemy cultures and/or field work. New cultures need to be set up, old cultures cleaned, and host material properly discarded. Put all material in heavy black plastic bags, seal tightly, and take to an appropriate disposal site a safe distance from the insectary facilities. You may need to collect natural enemies from cages for release that day. Once you have worked in the natural enemy insectary, or have handled or released natural enemies, never reenter the PHM insectary or host plant storage area, and never handle uninfested host plant material.

Field Work
Field work should follow the natural enemy culture work. Do not work on field samples in the parasite insectary or mealybug culture room. A separate room is ideal for holding and examining field material to avoid contaminating the pure cultures. Keeping this room at a constant temperature of approximately 80°F (27°C), you can hold samples up to 30 days for parasite emergence.

Host Plant Material
Two host plants suitable for use in propagating PHM in the insectary are the Japanese pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata (Duchesne) var. chirimen) and potatoes. The following subsection discusses the use of these artificial host plants.

Using Japanese Pumpkins as Host Plants
The Japanese pumpkin, (Figure 3-1), is a product of Takii Seed Company (Parent Company is in Kyoto, Japan). It has been successfully used as an artificial host plant to mass produce three other species of mealybugs including: Comstock mealybug, Pseudococcus comstocki (Kuwana) (Meyerdirk and Newell 1979), spherical mealybug, Nipaecoccus viridis (Newstead) (Meyerdirk, et al. 1988), and citrus mealybug, Planococcus citri (Risso) (Chandler et al. 1980).

09/2001-01 PPQ

FIGURE 3-1: Japanese pumpkin, Curcurbita moschata (Duchesne) var. chirimen
Description
The fruit is a flat globe, distinctly ribbed and warted. The rind is dark green, turning to buff yellow when fully ripe. The flesh is cream yellow and thick, with a sweet, nutty flavor. While the plants are easy to grow and set fruit prolifically in temperate climates, they are not so easily grown in tropical, wet climates. Results may be poor during the rainy season. Since this pumpkin is a hybrid, it is not possible to save seed from harvested pumpkins to use for next year’s planting needs.

Field Production
Since the pumpkin is susceptible to frost, planting the seeds in a greenhouse with controlled temperatures of greater than 70°F (21°C) will allow the earliest planting and harvest in temperate climates. Growing the seedlings in flats and transplanting in tropical climates will maximize production (Figure 3-2). In temperate climates, plant approximately 2,500 seedlings in flats about 3-4 weeks before transplanting; in tropical climates, plant 1,000 seeds every 60 days.

Transplanting: Transplant seedlings to the field at the 2–4 leaf stage and use hot-caps if necessary in temperate climates, depending on outside temperatures. Have the following supplies ready:
N Hand trowels (10–12) N Hoes (4–5) N Sticks cut to 4 ft. (1.2 m) in length (6)
Space the seedlings 4 ft. (1.2 m) apart in the row, with approximately 6.7 ft. (2.0 m) between rows. If using 40-in. (1.0-m) furrows, plant the pumpkin seedlings in every other row. Depending on irrigation systems, you may plant the seedlings on the edge of the furrow. To accomplish this operation most efficiently, divide duties up according to the number of workers available. Caution workers not to trample down the furrows during transplanting activities.
1. Send workers down the rows measuring off exactly 4 feet (1.2 m), using the 4-ft. sticks. Have the workers dig a small hole for the seedlings every 4 feet.
2. Send another set of workers down the rows placing bunches of seedlings alongside each hole.
To prevent the root system from drying out, do not lay out too many plants ahead of time before planting!
Important
3. Send a third set of workers behind the above to put plants in the holes. Cover the roots with soil and tap down gently.
4. Apply a 10-10-10 (NPK) fertilizer about 4 weeks after planting. 5. Continue watering as needed. 6. Record planting data on Form PHM-3 (Appendix H).

Greenhouse Production
These same pumpkins have been grown in greenhouses in central California during the winter. The following are guidelines for greenhouse production based on past growing experience in California.
Regulating temperature and spacing: At the time of planting, the soil temperature should be about 50°F (10°C) and the air temperature should be between 58°F (14°C) and 80°F (27°C). Transplant seedlings the second week in January when you observe the first main leaf. Plant seedlings in groups of two’s and pinch off the weaker plant 2 weeks later. Space each plant 2 feet (0.6 m) apart within rows bedded with straw. Train the vines to grow up when they reach 12 to 15 inches (30 to 38 cm) and attach them to overhead wires with nylon twine suspended from steel rods at each end of the rows.
Controlling disease: To prevent pathogen damage, remove all laterals and leaves touching the ground except the main lateral. Pathogens likely to be encountered include Botrytis, which attacks the blossom ends of the fruit and causes deterioration, and Sclerotinia which attacks open wounds on the plant and multiplies in decaying debris on the ground. To prevent damage by these organisms, good sanitation is important. Hand pick infected leaves and apply a mixture of Boltran and Benlate with baby powder as a carrier. Water the plants once a week in the early stages of growth and up to 3 times a week in later growth. Use straw to bed the plants, retain moisture, and build up carbon dioxide in the air.
Fertilizing: Apply fertilizer early and during the middle of the growth stages to promote leaf and lateral growth. Use 15-30-15 NPK to start and shift to 26-16-6 NPK toward the middle when pumpkins are being formed. A supplemental application of nitrogen may improve fruit set. Use urea (46-0-0) and some potash to retain leaves and force pumpkin production. As pumpkins ripen, support them in the air with a netting.

Harvesting Pumpkins
The preferred stage for harvesting the Japanese pumpkins is in between the green and orange stages, when the pumpkins are dark green or black and very dull—no longer shiny. When the pumpkins have become dull the skin should have hardened. At this stage the pumpkins are fully ripe. This is the stage preferred by PHM and also the stage which will give the longest shelf life. When harvesting, leave a short stem attached to the pumpkin (Figure 3-3), and pack in straw to prevent bruising. Wooden crates may be useful in transporting the pumpkins from the field. Handle the pumpkins carefully to avoid injury to the skin (do not throw or drop pumpkins). Bacteria will enter injured areas, and the pumpkins will break down. Discard cracked pumpkins.

Preparing Pumpkins for Storage
After harvest and before storage, wash the pumpkins in 5 percent bleach solution. Brush off all dirt and insect life with a soft bristle brush. Add specific fungicide and miticide with no insecticidal properties to the wash water as available.
These chemicals were available in St. Kitts:
N Fungicide: Manzate
N Miticide: Dicofol
Storing Pumpkins
Shelf life of the pumpkin can span 3 months, but by that time they are past the stage where PHM will settle, feed, and develop. If rodents are present, build a wire cage to keep them out. Store the harvested and washed pumpkins on open shelves in a large, open room, or on shelves outside under a roof shelter, to allow for air circulation. Air conditioning may not be necessary, but the pumpkins should remain dry and should get plenty of air flow from windows or other openings. Use a dehumidifier to reduce moisture levels if necessary. Ideally, the pumpkins should not touch each other during storage. Each week, examine all stored pumpkins for rot and insects. Discard rotting pumpkins and brush mealybugs or other pests from the pumpkins.

Operating the Insectary: Host Plant Material Using Potatoes as Host Plants
Using Potatoes as Host Plants
Potatoes have served as a useful host for many different species of mealybugs. It is not the potato itself that the mealybug feeds upon, but the blanched sprout of the potato. You can sprout potatoes without soil and water on an open rack system (Figure 3-4) or partially submerged in a box containing soil (Figure 3-5) that is occasionally watered. The latter requires more care and maintenance of the potatoes and room conditions. In both systems, the potatoes are grown TOTALLY in the DARK to keep the sprout from producing chlorophyll and turning green, which is not desirable to the mealybug. The mealybug crawlers and various instars will feed directly on the potato sprout. Russet or other white seed potatoes have worked well in the past. This is a backup host plant in case the pumpkins are not available, or to be used in small test containers, or to supplement the pumpkin culture of the mealybug.

FIGURE 3-4: Open rack system for sprouting potatoes

FIGURE 3-5: Sprouted potatoes partially submerged in a box containing soil

Seed potatoes are best to purchase in 100-lb. (45 kg) bags, because they are not treated with sprouting inhibitors. You can buy these bags in large quantities and refrigerate at 37°F (3°C) to 45°F (7°C) for long periods. Sometimes, cutting the tip of the potato can stimulate sprouting. Sprouting of last seasons’ potatoes may take 4–6 weeks.

Wash, dry, and lay the potatoes out on trays. Place the potatoes in a dark room for sprouting at room temperature. When sprouts are at least ½–1 inch (1.3–2.5 cm) long, lightly infest the sprouts with crawlers (Figure 3-6) and return them to a room with NO LIGHT except for temporary maintenance.

FIGURE 3-6: Potato sprouts (foreground) infested with PHM crawlers
Potatoes potted in soil and kept watered require more care and are subject to diseases. Partially submerge these potatoes in the soil, with half the potato lying flat above the surface. Boxes must be able to drain off excess water through the bottom of the box. These sprouts become thick and long, reaching 12 inches (30.5 cm) or more in height.
Using Potted Plants as Host Plants
You can also use plants like hibiscus potted in 1-gallon (3.8-liter) containers as host material, but this will require propagation or purchase. If grown inside, plants will require adequate space, overhead lighting (for example, grow-lux lights), and large cages to confine the PHM on the plants and prevent predators or parasites from entering. These same cages in turn will serve to contain the natural enemies for propagation.

Introduction

The PHM insectary should consist of two rooms (approximately 150 ft2 or 14 m2 each) plus another room (approximately 100 ft2 or 9.3 m2) to
collect crawlers. Depending on the size of the insectary, the crawler
collection system can be isolated in a large cardboard box in a separate room (see Establishing a Crawler Collection System). When
room #1 of the mealybug insectary is filled with PHM-infested
pumpkins, begin filling room #2. As room #2 is being filled, begin to
empty room #1 by transferring host material to parasite and predator
cultures, or to the crawler collection system for the PHM stock culture.

Sanitizing the Insectary
Each room should remain empty for 1 week to allow time for cleaning and decontamination. Sweep the rooms and then mop with 10 percent bleach solution. Wipe shelves with 10 percent bleach solution.

Preparing the Room for Pumpkins
The PHM insectary room should be at least 150 ft2 (14 m2), with wooden shelves approximately 18 in (46 cm) deep at 1-ft (30 cm) intervals above each other along the walls of the room (Figure 3-8).

FIGURE 3-8: Wooden shelves supporting plastic trays with infested pumpkins

Operating the Insectary: Pink Hibiscus Mealybug (PHM) Culture Preparing the Room for Potatoes

Use at least five shelves per wall to support plastic (cafeteria-style) trays of infested host plant material (pumpkins or potatoes).

Important

If possible, use free-standing racks, preferably on rollers, rather than shelves attached to walls. The racks can be removed from the insectary room for cleaning and sterilizing.

Curtains made of heavy black cloth, hung from the top shelves and draped to the floor, help eliminate all light from the PHM culture. These curtains will cover newly infested pumpkins or potatoes and prevent light from attracting the crawlers while people are working in the room each day. All light sources are OFF and NO outside light should penetrate the room. Since light attracts crawlers, rear the PHM cultures in TOTAL DARKNESS to prevent crawlers from walking off the pumpkins. Turn on lights and throw back the black curtains only when technicians are working in the culture for short periods of time. Do NOT take work breaks and leave the lights on!

Supply the two host rooms with air-conditioning units and industrial grade portable fans, to maintain room temperatures between 75°F (24°C) and 85°F (30°C), and to provide adequate air circulation. If necessary, use a dehumidifier to keep relative humidity at approximately 60 percent. The door to the rooms should open to the outside. Construct a small cubicle to provide another small entry door, also opening to the outside, to prevent entry of foreign insects and parasites to the room inside. A sink with running water is desirable to wash trays and tables. Use plastic serving trays lined with paper towels as a portable substrate, which allows workers to move the pumpkins from place to place as needed. The paper towels will absorb honeydew excreted by the mealybugs.

Preparing the Room for Potatoes
When pumpkins are scarce, you can use sprouted potatoes for host material. A room, kept dark to prevent greening of the sprouts, will provide for adequate storage of potatoes and will allow the potatoes to sprout over time. Line the room walls with wooden shelves, and spread out potatoes on plastic trays on the shelves. Temperatures may fluctuate between 75°F (24°C) and 90°F (32°C), and a relative humidity of 70 percent is ideal.

Operating the Insectary: Pink Hibiscus Mealybug (PHM) Culture Transferring Pumpkins or Potatoes
Transferring Pumpkins or Potatoes
Each weekday morning, select 5 to 10 pumpkins from the storage area for use in host culture, depending on the number of pumpkins available for future use. Before infesting, examine the pumpkins and brush off or remove any mealybugs or other contaminants. Place the pumpkins on a piece of paper towel on a plastic tray and transfer them to the host culture room. Depending on the length of time in storage, another dip treatment of bleach, miticide, and fungicide may be necessary. Make sure the pumpkins are dry before infesting with PHM and placing in PHM culture.
Starting the PHM Culture on Laboratory Host Plant Material
To initiate a pure culture of PHM, you will need to carefully transfer single, gravid adult PHM females from field material to insectary host material. The females must be confirmed as PHM. Take care not to transfer other species of mealybugs. When the females begin laying ovisacs (egg sacs) on the pumpkins, transfer these ovisacs to new pumpkins daily to maintain the culture. The following steps describe the egg sac transfer system.
Step 1—Select from the mealybug host culture one PHM-infested pumpkin that has adult females with ovisacs containing eggs.
Step 2—With a 0000-size camel hair brush and using a 2¼ X magnifocuser, carefully transfer 50–100 ovisacs onto each of the five pumpkins to be infested. Dampening the brush with water may help the ovisacs stick to the brush during the transfer process, if necessary. Take care not to transfer ovisacs from any contaminant species of mealybugs. During the transfer process, place ovisacs within the grooves of the pumpkin over the entire upper half surface of the pumpkin.
Step 3—Place a paper tag showing the date of infestation on the tray with the pumpkins. Store the pumpkins on shelves behind a black curtain that drapes over the rack and excludes light from the room.

Operating the Insectary: Pink Hibiscus Mealybug (PHM) Culture Establishing a Crawler Collection System
Establishing a Crawler Collection System
You will eventually need a crawler collection system to make the insectary operation more efficient at collecting 1-2 day old PHM crawlers as they hatch from the egg masses. Such a system will allow a more even distribution of the developmental stages in the mealybug culture on each pumpkin and allow specific stages to be selected for the parasite production with minimal overlap of other stages. You can use a crawler collection box or dedicate a total room (see page 3-18) to this system, depending on the size of your facility and the PHM culture.
Crawler Collection Box
Construct a crawler collection box using a large, heavy cardboard box, approximately 30 in (76 cm) x 30 in x 30 in. To modify the box, follow these steps:
Step 1—Close the box. Tape the lid with duct tape to prevent light entry.
Step 2—Cut a door flap, 14 in (36 cm) x 14 in, into the side of the box, leaving the top side uncut. This uncut top side will serve as a hinge, allowing the door to swing upward.
Step 3—Tape manila folders to the bottom with a 6-in (15-cm) square cut out of the front section and not taped. Cut a second manila folder section 12 in (30 cm) square to serve as a paper tray that slides under the folder taped to the box.
Step 4—Plug a small (7-watt) night lamp into a 12-ft (4-m) extension cord (Figure 3-9). Push the lamp through a small hole in the top front section of the box so that the light hangs in the center of the small paper tray on the bottom of the box. Position the light to hang just 4 in (10 cm) off the bottom of the tray with light focused on the paper tray. Wrap aluminum foil around the lamp to reduce the light and focus it on the paper tray below.

Operating the Insectary: Pink Hibiscus Mealybug (PHM) Culture Establishing a Crawler Collection System
Step 5—Place infested host plant material (pumpkins or potatoes) inside the box and around the outer edge. Use small wire trays to hold the host material off the paper to allow crawlers to walk underneath if they fall behind the host material. You can use additional wire racks to hold a second level of host plant material inside the box along the back edge.
Step 6—Seal the box and leave the light turned on continuously. Close and tape the door. The hatching crawlers will be attracted to the small light inside the box and will gather in large numbers on the removable paper tray. Cover the box with a heavy black cloth large enough to wrap around the box and over the top to prevent any light from penetrating the box (Figure 3-10). Tuck the end of the cloth under the box.

FIGURE 3-10: Crawler collection box covered with heavy black cloth
Step 7—Check the box and collect crawlers daily. Remove crawlers by curling the paper tray. Tap the crawlers into a large plastic vial for transport to the mealybug culture room where you will infest new pumpkins or potatoes. Using Form PHM-4 (Appendix H), record the date you collected the crawlers, the volume or weight of crawlers collected, the number of host plants infested, and the total host units infested. Use Form PHM-5 to keep a copy of the host infestation record on each tray of host material as it moves through each level of production.
Step 8—Rotate old pumpkins and potatoes out of the crawler collection box. Keep the box as clean as possible, supplying new paper trays as needed.

Crawler Collection Room
If the insectary is large enough to warrant the use of a large crawler collection system, then a room (approximately 100 ft2 or 9.3 m2) can become the crawler collection “box” only on a larger scale. This room needs an appropriate air-conditioning system to control temperatures near 80°F (27°C). The room must be totally darkened so no outside light can penetrate, including light from under functioning doors. All windows need to be blocked from incoming light.
You can use two different types of crawler collection room systems:
N Hot wire barrier system
N Light only system
The first type uses a hot wire barrier that stops the advancement of crawlers toward an open light in the room. The second type uses only a small light source to attract and hold the crawlers in place. Set up the room using one of these systems, described in detail below.

3-18

Operating the Insectary: Pink Hibiscus Mealybug (PHM) Culture Establishing a Crawler Collection System
Hot Wire Barrier System
This is the most efficient crawler collection system, but it requires more equipment and is more complicated to set up than the light only system. Use this system if you have the resources and expertise to put it in place.
Step 1—Build three to four racks to hold four to five shelves of pumpkins. The racks should be approximately 3 ft (1 m) wide x 2 ft (0.6 m) deep x 6 ft (2 m) high. A room with four racks can then hold about 20 trays (Figure 3-11) each with approximately 12 pumpkins. See Appendix I for an illustration showing dimensions of the PHM culture racks.

FIGURE 3-11: Rack used in the hot wire barrier system holding five shelves of pumpkins
Step 2—Mount in a vertical position a 36-in (92-cm), 20-watt fluorescent light on a wooden stand about 4 ft (1.2 m) high. Place the light in the corner of the room facing the racks that will hold the pumpkins infested with egg masses. This crawler collection light should be the only light in the room. Leave this light on continuously and be prepared to replace the light when necessary to avoid loss of crawler production if the light burns out.

Step 3—Cut 30-in (76-cm) wide pieces of plywood tapered to the front (Figure 3-12), to make removable five-sided shelves that will fit in the rack on the shelf holder cross member. Glue a smooth layer of white formica to the surface of each shelf. Place shelves on the racks about 12–16 in (30–40 cm) apart.

FIGURE 3-12: Removable five-sided shelf used in hot wire barrier system
Step 4—Secure on insulators a wire (heating wire found in toasters) ¼ in (6 mm) off the formica, running from the back of the shelf all around the front, then returning to the back.
Step 5—Connect a rheostat (Figure 3-13) to the wires on each tray of the rack and adjust to heat the wire to a temperature of 115°F (46°C). Avoid higher temperatures, which will kill the crawlers. Crawlers, actually remaining about 1 in (25 mm) behind the wire, will not cross this hot wire barrier, even though they are attracted to the light ahead of them.

Step 6—Equip each crawler collection tray with a removable section about 6 in (15 cm) deep x 10 in (25 cm) wide in front of the tray. This section is a piece of white formica that slips under a small overlapping paper lip attached to the main tray. This construction will allow the crawlers to walk across to the removable tray without falling into the crack. Place four or five of these trays from which to collect crawlers on each rack.
Step 7—Position another insulated wire and a spring to hold the front end of the heated wire that straddles the removable tray. You should be able to lift this spring up to remove the tray with live crawlers.
Step 8—Place pumpkins or other host material infested with egg masses on small wire trays to keep the host material from directly contacting the formica tray. Place larger wire tray stands on each tray to stack the pumpkins on the trays two layers high if necessary.
Step 9—Tap the crawlers collected from each tray onto a manila folder and transfer them to a large vial. Measure and/or weigh the vial to determine the quantity of PHM crawler material produced that day.
Step 10—Discard the pumpkins after all crawlers have emerged (about 2 weeks).
Light Only System
You can use another crawler collection system similar to the crawler collection box that is less complicated than the hot wire barrier system. Again, the room is substituted for the box.
Step 1—Center a large table (4–5 ft2 or 0.4–0.5 m2) in the room. You can use a sheet of plywood on top of a smaller table.
Step 2—Glue a covering of white formica onto the table top.
Step 3—Attach two 7-watt night lights to an extension cord to form a small light system. Hang the lights down from the ceiling just over the center of the table, about 4–5 in (10–13 cm) above the table top. Cover each light with aluminum foil to focus the light on the table below. The extra light is a precaution in case one light burns out overnight; the other will still attract the crawlers, and you will not lose a day’s worth of crawlers.
Step 4—Develop the same type of tray system as described above in the hot wire barrier system. Crawlers moving from the perimeter of the table will approach the light in the center of the table and walk into the removable tray system. To construct this tray system, tape a manila folder on three sides and cut out a 12-in (30-cm) section in the center to form a “U” shape. Use another manila folder as the tray, which slides underneath the taped top folder.

Operating the Insectary: Pink Hibiscus Mealybug (PHM) Culture Culturing PHM
Step 5—Place infested pumpkins or potatoes with egg masses around the perimeter of the table on three sides. Set the host material on small wire trays that will hold the pumpkins or potatoes about 1 in (2.5 cm) off the substrate. Doing this will allow the crawlers to fall to the table top and walk under the host material freely without being obstructed. You can place pumpkins on the wire trays two deep. Leave one side of the table open to work freely on the table top and to permit moving the tray in and out of its holder for crawler collection.
Step 6—Rotate in infested pumpkins and potatoes with egg masses weekly; take out and discard old material. Use each side of the table to represent a new set of host material to exchange in about a 2–3 week period. Collect crawlers daily and use them to infest new host material for the PHM stock culture. Remove decaying host material as necessary.

Culturing PHM

Quantify the amount of PHM crawlers collected daily either by weighing or by measuring the volume of crawlers. Log daily records of crawler production for future use to determine the relative production levels for comparative purposes and to alert the insectary operator when production declines.

Gently sprinkle crawlers widely over the upper surface of the pumpkins or above the potato sprouts. The actual amount may vary depending on crawler production. Place no more than one ¼-dram vial of crawlers on an average sized pumpkin (2–3 lbs or 0.9–1.4 kg).

Set pumpkins on paper towels on a cafeteria type tray, which may hold four to six pumpkins. The paper towels will help absorb the honeydew excreted by the mealybugs. Separate the pumpkins by several inches (5–10 cm) to prevent contact by honeydew from mealybugs on other pumpkins and to help prevent the spread of fruit rot when it occurs.

Place all newly infested pumpkins on an appropriate shelf in the PHM culture room. Cover the pumpkins with a heavy black cloth draped over the rack holding the pumpkins to reduce the room light contacting the crawlers while you are working. The crawlers are highly attracted to light. Keep work in the PHM culture room at a minimum to reduce the influence of light on the crawlers’ movement off the pumpkins. When the PHM culture room light is off, you should see no light in the room, including light from under a door. Total darkness is the optimal system. Anything less will influence the crawlers to move off the pumpkins. Check around window air conditioners and windows to eliminate small pockets of light. You can move infested pumpkins 15 days old out from under the black cloth onto another rack, but they must remain in the PHM culture room in total darkness. Keep the PHM culture room at a constant temperature of 80°F (27°C) with relative humidity of 60 percent.

Always retain half of the PHM culture in all stages to maintain the stock culture of PHM. Do not remove more than half of the infested material per day for natural enemy production. Keep a record on each tray of when the tray was infested and when material was removed for natural enemies, or disposed of, because of rotting pumpkins.
Infested pumpkins may remain in this room from 30 to 45 days before they are transferred to a crawler collection system or used for natural enemy production. Anagyrus kamali and Gyranusoidea indica production will require mostly third instars of PHM and Cryptolaemus montrouzieri will need fresh egg mass material for ovipositioning.

Examining Pumpkins
Examine all infested pumpkins in the host culture weekly. Search for the following:
N Decaying host material (discard as necessary)
N Contaminant species of mealybugs
N Predator larvae
N Signs of parasite activity
Kill any contaminant mealybugs and remove any decaying pumpkins and pumpkins showing signs of parasites (mummified mealybugs). If this occurs, you will need to start a new PHM culture in another protected rearing room. Use these infested pumpkins in this room for predator production only; do not use them for pure parasite cultures. To limit future spread of PHM, properly dispose of all infested material at a site within the infested area.

Selecting PHM-Infested Pumpkins for the Parasite, Predator, or PHM Cultures
To select PHM-infested pumpkins for parasite and predator cultures, follow these steps:
Step 1—Select appropriate numbers of pumpkins or potatoes with late second or third instar PHM for new parasite cultures. Transport them to the parasite rearing lab as needed for setting up parasite stings.
Step 2—Select infested pumpkins with older adult female PHM with a majority of ovisacs for the predator culture each week.

Exotic Natural Enemy Shipments
Each exotic natural enemy culture will start by receiving a shipment of insects from abroad. Proper processing and recording is very important, so be sure to carefully handle and record the contents of each shipment.

Keeping Records
Each shipment must have been previously cleared through a quarantine facility or must be known to be a pure laboratory culture of a specific species of natural enemy previously cleared through quarantine, unless the material can be screened through a local quarantine facility.
When you receive the shipment, take care in recording the contents of the shipment. Using Form PHM-6 (Appendix H), properly document the shipment by recording the following data:
N Vial or packet number
N Host insect (P1) N Entomophagous species
N Number of natural enemies found alive and dead
N Total number of females and males present or later emerged
N Number of natural enemies propagated (F1) on target mealybugs in laboratory
Identify and number each vial or container. Use a special numbering system for each shipment and container within, for example: 98 (year)-1 (number of the shipment for the year)-1 (number of container in shipment). Identify, properly label, and send voucher specimens to the appropriate museum curator.

Carefully transfer each species of imported natural enemy to a separate cage containing various instars of PHM, which should be mostly late second and third instars. If you do not know the mealybug host stage, expose the parasites to first, second, third, and adult female stages. Properly label each cage with the shipment number and record the number of individual natural enemies (P1) placed in the cage. Record the number of individuals (F1) propagated from the parents (P1) on PHM in your laboratory. Continue to track and record on the cage’s label the number of F1 individuals that emerge. You will later tally this number on a summary sheet. Monitor and record the production of the F2 and F3 generations until you put each species into a mass production system.

Natural Enemy Culture: Parasites
The parasites presently available for biological control of PHM are two small wasps, Anagyrus kamali and Gyranusoidea indica. Procedures for rearing these parasites follow.

Life Cycle

Anagyrus kamali is a primary, solitary endoparasitoid; one adult parasitoid is produced from each PHM parasitized, with the entire immature development occurring within the PHM host (Cross and Noyes, 1995). For a diagrammatic illustration of the development cycle of A. kamali, see Figure 3-15; for color photographs of male and female adults, see Figure 3-13 and Figure 3-14.

Large Aluminum Cage
With some modifications, you can also use a larger commercially available aluminum cage, 12 in (30.5 cm) x 12 in x 24 in (61 cm), that folds flat, for parasite production. Remove the door screen and replace it with two muslin cloth sleeves, held in by the rubber spline material around the frame. Replace the screen material at the top of the cage with a solid piece of plexiglas attached with silicone glue. To support the pumpkins when moving the cage, attach the bottom of the cage to a 3/8-in (1-cm) thick piece of plywood or Plexiglas using silicone glue. Seal the door with ½-in (1.3-cm) thick weather stripping.
Single and Double Hole Wooden Cages
Single and double hole wooden cages are optimum for rearing mealybugs on pumpkins for these reasons:
N They are sturdy N They are durable N They can be easily washed and maintained N They can last a long time
If you have the time and materials, construct these cages using 5/8-in (1.6-cm) thick marine plywood. The double hole sleeve cage (see Appendix I for dimensions) is more suitable for six to eight pumpkins, while the single hole cage is good for experiments, sprouted potatoes, or one to two pumpkins.
Setting Up the Aspirator
To aspirate parasites for transfer to sting cages and to the field for release, use an aspirator attached to a vacuum pump (Figure 3-18).

Establishing Weekly Parasite Oviposition Cages
Providing Parasite Sting Cages with Host Material
Prepare a clean, empty parasite rearing cage with paper toweling placed on the cage floor. Paint thin honey streaks inside the top of the cage, and position a petri dish containing water-soaked absorbent cotton in one corner of the cage floor. Place in the prepared rearing cage four pumpkins from the host culture infested with third-instar PHM.
Selecting Cages for Aspirating Parasites
Check for adult emergence in cages set up 16 days previously. Look for cages with a new emergence of adult parasites. Males will emerge first, followed by the females. Choose a cage with approximately a 50:50 sex ratio of emerged parasites for aspirating.
Aspirating Parasites for the Sting Cage
When you find an appropriate cage, untie and open the sleeve of the cage and shake the sleeve gently to dislodge any parasites sitting inside the sleeve. Aspirate parasites from these cages. For sting cages with approximately four well-infested pumpkins, use 500 parasites per cage. For sting cages with approximately six to eight pumpkins, use 1,000 parasites per cage. To do this, use the aspirator, vacuum pump, and 9-dram vial described above in the Setting Up the Aspirator subsection. Working through the opened cloth sleeve of the new cage with unstung PHM, place the vial with the aspirated parasites on the floor of the newly prepared cage. Remove the lids from the vials and leave the vials upright on the cage bottom. Allow the parasites to leave the vials on their own and find the PHM-infested host material provided. Close the sleeve by tying it in an overhand knot.
Using Form PHM-8 in Appendix H, record the species, cage number, date of sting, number released in sting, host plant material, number of host plant units, date progeny collected, and number of progeny collected. Attach a form to each cage that remains, tracking production until you clean the cage. Transfer the data to summary Form PHM-9 and Form PHM-10.
Labeling the Sting Cage
Tape a paper label on one corner of the cage top for recording the date of cage set up, number of parasites (P1), species of parasite, and its origin. Use this label for recording the dates and numbers of F1 parasites emerged and aspirated for field release or for setting up new sting cages. You may take many collections over several weeks from each cage.

Operating the Insectary: Natural Enemy Culture: Parasites Maintaining the Parasite Cultures

Maintaining the Parasite Cultures
Check the parasite rearing cages daily for the following conditions:
N The need to renew honey streaks
N The need to renew water-soaked cotton
N Invasion of ants in the cage
N Rotting pumpkins (remove if necessary)
N Contaminants—either parasite or predator
N F1 parasite emergence (can be held another 16–21 days for F2 emergence and collection when necessary)
After checking the cages for these conditions, continue with the routine maintenance tasks described in detail below.
Providing Honey Streaks and Water-Soaked Cotton
Renew honey streaks and water-soaked cotton as needed throughout the life of the parasite sting within the cage.
Controlling Ants/Cockroaches
Treat for ants and cockroaches as needed by applying a thin film of boric acid crystals to the floor, racks, and shelves in the parasite laboratory. Do not use liquid pesticides, such as in a spray or bait, which may volatilize or contact the parasites. For ant control on free-standing racks holding cages, put each leg of the rack in vegetable oil in a small pan or lid. To protect cages on table tops, place the cages on small legs and position the legs in shallow pans containing vegetable oil.
Removing Rotting Pumpkins
Working through the cage sleeve, carefully brush all mealybugs and mummies from the rotting pumpkin. Remove the pumpkin from the cage and discard it in a sealed plastic bag.
Aspirating Contaminants
If you notice contaminants, aspirate them from the cage into a 9-dram vial. Positive identification will require microscopic examination. Examine the cage carefully to find any possible leaks where the contaminants might have entered. Make temporary repairs with tape. Record the incidence of contamination on the cage label provided.
Recording Adult Emergence
When daily observations reveal F1 parasite emergence, record the date of first emergence on the cage label. Examine the cage carefully each day after that to learn when both sexes have emerged.

Operating the Insectary: Natural Enemy Culture: Parasites Maintaining the Parasite Cultures
Using Emerged Adults for Culture Reproduction and Field Colonization
After adequate F1 emergence with a 1:1 sex ratio, you may use the cage to supply parasites for setting up new weekly sting cages. After removing enough parasites for use in new sting units for the week, you can aspirate the remainder of the parasites from the cage for field release. F1 emergence will take place over approximately a 1-week period. As the F1 parasites emerge, they will parasitize any unparasitized PHM in second instar through early adult stages in the cage. Therefore, you may wish to hold the cage an additional 2½ to 3 weeks to allow for a second generation (F2) of emergence. Holding cages for F2 and F3 emergence has on occasion led to serious sugar mite contamination. Hold cages in the insectary for prolonged periods of time only as an emergency measure.
Cleaning-Up and Repairing the Cages
After emergence is completed and you have removed all parasites from the cage, discard the pumpkins in sealed plastic bags. Scrub and clean the cage with soap and water. Examine the cage carefully and make any necessary repairs.
Performing Weekly Laboratory Maintenance
Each Friday, sweep the laboratory and mop with a dilute (5 percent) bleach solution. Wipe down all racks, shelves, table tops, and counter tops with 5 percent bleach solution. After the floor is dry, spread boric acid crystals again throughout the lab.

Natural Enemy Culture: Predators
The preferred predator to use as a biological pesticide for the control of PHM is the lady bird beetle, Cryptolaemus montrouzieri, known as the “Mealybug Destroyer.” This predator is available commercially (Hunter, 1997). For color photographs of larval and adult life stages, see Figure 3-20 and Figure 3-21.

Operating the Insectary: Natural Enemy Culture: Predators Determining Production Capacity
Determining Production Capacity
Setting 17 cages will yield between 4,000 and 6,000 Cryptolaemus per month for field release. The limiting factor is the availability of PHM-infested Japanese pumpkins from the PHM insectary culture.
Maintaining the Cryptolaemus Culture
Maintain the Cryptolaemus culture in a lighted room approximately 100 ft2 (9.3 m2), with air conditioning holding the temperature at 80°F (27°C). Choose pumpkins that have mostly young egg masses from the PHM host culture once per week. If necessary to hold for a time, keep in a darkened room until needed for Cryptolaemus culture. Holding the host material in a darkened room prevents PHM crawlers from leaving the surface of the pumpkins and traveling toward the light source.
Using Suitable Rearing Cages
The Cryptolaemus culture with a production capacity of 4,000–6,000 per month can use up to 17 plastic rearing cages with the following specifications:
N Detachable N Polypropylene N External dimensions: 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm N Weight: 930 g N Mesh size: 24 mesh
Using Preferred Host Material
Host material used for propagating Cryptolaemus, in order of preference, is as follows:
A. PHM-infested (egg mass) Japanese pumpkins from lab culture
B. PHM-infested local variety of pumpkin from lab culture C. PHM-infested sprouted potatoes from lab culture D. Field-collected, PHM-infested soursop fruit E. Field-collected, PHM-infested hibiscus cuttings

Operating the Insectary: Natural Enemy Culture: Predators Setting Up the Oviposition Units
Use field-collected, PHM-infested host material only when the lab-reared host material is scarce. Contaminants will be common in these cages.
Setting Up the Oviposition Units
Set up the oviposition units every 2 weeks using these procedures:
Step 1—Set up three rearing cages and add three infested pumpkins from host culture to each cage. The mealybug life stage offered should be adult PHM females with ovisacs.
Step 2—Streak honey on the undersides of the cage tops. Place a petri dish containing water-soaked absorbent cotton in each cage.
Step 3—Place 100 adult Cryptolaemus (50 female and 50 male) in each of the three cages. Allow the Cryptolaemus adults to remain in the oviposition cage for an egg laying period of 7 days. After the seventh day, aspirate the adults into a plastic vial and transfer them to a second cage. Divide the host material in the original cage into three parts by removing two of the three pumpkins and placing each in a separate cage. This will prevent overcrowding of the small cages. At the end of another 7 days, transfer the ovipositing adults to a third cage. After the third 7-day oviposition period, remove them and use these older beetles for field releases. Divide the host material from the second and third oviposition cages in the same manner as with the first cage. This produces a total of nine propagation cages.
Aiding Larval Development
During the next 2 weeks, when the Cryptolaemus larvae are developing, add one to two PHM-infested pumpkins to each cage twice a week. The mealybug life stage offered is adult females with ovisacs.
Step 1—Once a week, brush larvae from the oldest pumpkins in each cage and remove the oldest pumpkin(s) to make room for new host material. Add PHM-infested pumpkins containing mealybug stages described above.
Step 2—Place pumpkins removed from cages on a plastic tray and store on a shelf in the lab for 1 week.
Step 3—At the end of the week, use a size 0000 camel hair artist’s brush to brush any developing larvae off the pumpkins into a petri dish. Return the larvae to the cage and discard the pumpkins on the plastic tray.

Operating the Insectary: Natural Enemy Culture: Predators Monitoring Pupation
Monitoring Pupation
After the 2-week larval development period, the larvae begin to pupate. At this point, stop adding host material to the cages. The Cryptolaemus will remain in pupal stage for 1 week, after which adult beetles begin to emerge.
Providing Food and Water at Emergence
As beetles begin emerging, streak honey stripes on the underside of the cage top and place a petri dish containing water-soaked cotton in the cage. Adult beetles will continue to emerge for approximately 1 week. After the first flush of emergence, remove and sex the beetles for use in setting up the next set of oviposition cages. To remove the adult beetles, use a portable electric vacuum pump attached to a flexible tube and aspirator with a plastic vial.
Collecting Beetles for Field Release
As beetles continue to emerge, aspirate them into plastic vials every other day for field release. Place shredded paper inside each vial and stripes of honey inside the lids. Take vials of 100 beetles each to the field in a styrofoam ice chest containing a reusable frozen ice pack (blue ice) to keep the package cool during the release period. Wrap the ice pack in paper towels to prevent the vials from directly contacting it.
Do not leave beetles in closed cars where temperatures can exceed 100°F (38°C).

Purpose

The purpose of releasing natural enemies of PHM onto infested host plants is to allow the natural enemies to control local populations of the pest. This section is divided into two main subsections:
N Procedure for Parasites N Procedure for Predators
The first subsection, Procedure for Parasites, deals with release procedures for parasitic wasps. Use these procedures for long-term control of PHM.
The second subsection, Procedure for Predators, deals with release procedures for lady bird beetles. Use these procedures for a quick knock down of PHM on moderately to heavily infested plants.

Effectiveness of Parasites and Predators
Exotic parasites are the long term solution to the PHM pest problem, while use of the predaceous beetle will only serve as a short term solution. The major thrust of the program is to mass produce and widely distribute PHM parasites as soon as possible. The predaceous beetle functions as a biopesticide—use only when major economic losses may occur if more immediate control is not attained within a 6-week period.

4-1

Releasing Natural Enemies: Introduction Effectiveness of Parasites and Predators
Using the beetle will delay the effective establishment and impact of the parasites. The beetle will feed on parasitized mealybugs and significantly reduce the parasites’ population density if released at the same time and place. At sites where predaceous beetles are released, beetle populations eventually begin to decline in 6 to 9 months. If parasites are then introduced for establishment at those sites, they will continue to reduce mealybug populations, creating an environment unfavorable for beetle reproduction. The parasites may displace the beetles after some time.

Introduction

Releasing Natural Enemies2
Procedures for Parasites
Releasing parasites is an extremely important component of the PHM biological control program. You must try to release healthy parasites on suitable host plants infested with PHM. The parasites you may release are stingless wasps, Anagyrus kamali (Figure 4-1), Gyranusoidea indica, Leptomastix sp. (Figure 4-2), and possibly others. For color photographs and identifying characteristics of these parasites, refer to Figure 3-13 and Figure 3-14 in the previous section and to page 4-8.

Aspirating Parasites
These wasps are small, delicate insects. Be sure to use only a very gentle suction when you operate the aspirator pump.
Step 1—Select a cage from which to collect parasites.
Step 2—Place the aspirator assembly on a 9-dram plastic snap-cap vial and turn on the aspirator. Check the suction by placing it on your cheek. You should feel just a slight suction of the skin. Do not use a hard suction because this will kill the parasites.
Step 3—Untie and shake the sleeve to make sure the parasites are off the inside of the sleeve and back in the cage.
Step 4—Take the aspirator tube in your hand and insert the tube into the cage through the sleeve.
Step 5—Using the aspirator tube, carefully suction adult parasites into the plastic vial. Aspirate approximately 50 female and 50 male parasites in the plastic vial.
Step 6—Pull the aspirator assembly out of the sleeve.

Step 7—Shake the sleeve to make sure the remaining parasites are back in the cage. Twist and retie the sleeve.
Step 8—Gently tap the vial on the table top, quickly remove the aspirator, and cap the vial. If parasites are to remain in the vial for any length of time (as in shipping) place two very small droplets of honey inside the vial lid.
Transporting Parasites
When transporting parasites from the rearing facility to the field, keep them cool (about 55°F or 13°C is ideal) but not cold. If you use frozen gel packs in an insulated box, be sure to separate the parasites from the gel packs with foam or another material so the vials do not directly contact the gel packs.
Releasing Parasites
Selecting a good release site will increase the likelihood of the parasites’ colonization and survival. Look for suitable host plant material infested with PHM on which to release the parasites.
Step 1—After finding infested host plants, get the property owner’s permission to release the parasites in advance. Explain to the property owner how the biological control program works and stress the importance of not cutting (pruning), spraying, or destroying the plants. Give a program brochure and/or flier to the homeowner.
Step 2—Release the parasites directly onto the plants by removing the vial’s cap and wiring the vial tightly to a main branch or wedging it between twigs.
Step 3—Using Form PHM-11 (Appendix H), record the following information:
N Date released N Species released (Anagyrus, Gyranusoidea, or Leptomastix) N Name of owner N Releaser’s name (initials) N Address of release site (street number, name, county, State) N Name of host plant N Number of parasites released

Introduction

Releasing Natural Enemies3
Procedures for Predators
Releasing predators is another important component of the PHM biological control program. Predators work well on moderately to heavily infested host plants where a quick knock down of the pest population is necessary. They are useful as a biological pesticide where the natural enemy will provide dramatic short-term results. As with releasing parasites, try to release healthy predators on suitable host plants infested with PHM. The most common predator you will release is a small beetle, Cryptolaemus montrouzieri.

Transporting Predators
When transporting predators to the field, keep them cool. If you use frozen gel packs, separate the beetles from the gel pack with foam or other suitable material. Small slits in the plastic lids will allow for some circulation of air.

Releasing Predators
Predators will be most effective when released on host plants with high pest populations. Therefore, try to reserve your available predators for stands of plants heavily infested with PHM.
Step 1—Get the property owner’s permission to search for PHM and potentially release the predators. Explain to the property owner how the biological control program works and stress the importance of not spraying, pruning, or destroying the plants.
Step 2—Determine the number of predators to release based on the number of infested host plants and the level of infestation. As a general guide, release approximately 500 beetles per acre (1,250 beetles per hectare) or 250–500 beetles per home property. When purchasing Cryptolaemus beetles from a commercial supplier, check the number of beetles per shipping container. Normally, these beetles are shipped at the rate of 500 adults per vial. If your release site is a hotel or commercial property where the landscape is extremely valuable, you may need to release 1,000–5,000 beetles at once.

The purpose of evaluating results is to measure the success of the program. Three principal types of evaluation can be accomplished in a biological control program:
1. Colonization and establishment of the released exotic natural enemies
2. Impact of released natural enemies
3. Economic evaluation, including the actual and potential losses by the target pest and the cost of the biological control program, which can be used to develop a cost/benefit ratio.

Establishment of Natural Enemies

For a biological control program to be successful, the natural enemies must become established. The following sampling procedures described in this subsection will help you determine if previously released natural enemies have become colonized and established. This evaluation will consist of collecting and holding a percent parasitization sample for a period of time.

Equipment and Supplies
To evaluate the establishment and impact of natural enemies, you will need the following equipment and supplies:
N Beat sheet, 2 ft (60 cm) x 2 ft, made of white fabric N Beat sheet stick, 12 in (30 cm) x 1½ in (3.8 cm), doweling N Brush, small (approximately size 0) N Cooler and blue ice N Two counters, each with four digits N Dissecting microscope and light source N Forceps N Hand counter N Hand magnifying lens (10x) N Pharmaceutical gelatin capsules (size 0) N Plant shears N Probe N Record keeping forms N Sacks, large plastic and paper N Standard table forms

Evaluating Results: Establishment of Natural Enemies Evaluating Colonization and Establishment

Evaluating Colonization and Establishment
To determine the colonization (development of one or more generations in the field) and establishment (ability to persist for at least 3 years in the field) of released exotic natural enemies, sampling procedures were developed for both parasites and predators. These sampling procedures can also be used to determine dispersal of exotic natural enemies at various distances away from release sites. It is normally used in association with the PHM Population Density Counts, but can stand alone if just colonization, establishment or dispersal information is needed for a specific field site.

Recovering Parasites
The recovery of parasites from live PHM during a window of time will reflect the percent parasitization of PHM at the time of collection. It will indicate the presence or absence of parasites (colonization and establishment), the ratio of parasite species collected, and their abundance. Percent parasitization can be calculated based on the total number of live mealybugs collected.
Primary Parasite—The primary parasite is the “good” parasite that kills the PHM by laying an egg inside the mealybug. This egg develops into a maggot-type larva and feeds internally, killing the mealybug. These same primary parasites also feed on other individual mealybugs by piercing the PHM body and feeding on its body fluid, which also results in the death of the mealybug. Hyperparasites (secondary parasites) also exist in nature. These are other species of parasites that can usually be found in the local fauna attacking native mealybug primary parasites. Hyperparasites attack the primary parasite and are considered the “bad” parasite (Note: Hyperparasites).

Sampling to Determine Percent Parasitization
To determine percent parasitization, follow these steps:
Step 1—From the same “field study” sites where host plant samples were taken for the PHM Population Density Counts, randomly collect at least four additional infested twigs, place in a paper sack, and label “Percent Parasitization.” Include the following information:
N Collector’s name N Date collected N Host plant N Address (street number and name, county, and State) N Name of owner N Initial records (should indicate location of plant sampled—include
simple map)
