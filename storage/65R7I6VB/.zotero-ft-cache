Abstract

Biosecurity for Guam in
the New Millennium
AMuoborreey

Guam, a transportation hub for the western Paci c, has long been recognized as a stepping stone for island-hopping invasive insect species. The frequency of insect pest incursions on Guam has increased signi cantly during the past decade, coinciding with major changes to Guam's biosecurity infrastructure which include establishment of a USDA-APHIS Plant Inspection Station and transfer of Guam's plant protection and quarantine o cers from the Guam Department of Agriculture to the Guam Customs and Quarantine Agency. Impacts of these changes and recent attempts to improve Guam's biosecurity will be discussed.

1936 Entomological Survey of Guam

Biosecurity for Guam in

Justi cation for the Survey [Swezey and Association(1942)]:
"Guam is the most important station between the Philippines and Honolulu on the route of the Pan-American Airways across the Paci c, and as knowledge of the Guam insect fauna was meager, it was deemed important to acquire as complete a knowledge as possible of this fauna. Unknown insects were already being found in planes arriving at Pearl Harbor, Oahu, and, in spite of the system employed in the fumigation of the planes, an occasional insect was found which had not fully succumbed. There was some concern lest unknown pests might survive and succeed in becoming established, and, perhaps, destructive to sugar cane and other crops grown in Hawaii."

1936 Entomological Survey of Guam

The 1936 survey identi ed 50 agricultural pests on Guam which were not present in Hawaii at the time.
"No doubt there are many among them which would become serious crop pests if they should reach Hawaii and become established." [Swezey and Association(1942)]

Guam has no large-scale commercial farming and limited
variety of crops. Agricultural pests may be overlooked
because their hosts are not grown as crops on Guam.
Examples:

There is ample historical evidence that several pest insects have moved from Guam to Hawaii in association with movements of military personnel and equipment.
It is expected that tra c of invasion species on this  military pathway  will increase as the Guam military buildup gets underway.

In November 2004, the duties and functions of plant protection and quarantine were transferred from the Department of Agriculture to the Customs and Quarantine Agency of Guam. However, two (2) Plant Protection and Quarantine O cers, later re-designated and assigned the title of "Commodity Inspectors" and one (1) Entomologist, remained with the Department of Agriculture to manage and operate the USDA/Guam Plant Inspection Station. The duties of border inspection and various inland quarantine duties, including, but not limited to, store inspections, smuggling and interdiction, invasive species control and management, federal fumigations, federal export certi cations, local export certi cations, eradication program management, and local and federal monitoring program management, were left as responsibilities of the Department of Agriculture.

We are amending the regulations governing the importation of nursery stock and other articles by designating the ports of Atlanta, Georgia, and Agana, Guam, as plant inspection stations. The addition of the two plant inspection stations will help reduce transportation time and costs to importers who must currently import plants through inspection stations that are considerably distant from the importers' facilities.
