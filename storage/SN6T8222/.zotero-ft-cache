Draft Agenda for Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle IPM Meeting Sponsored by the
Western IPM Center
Prepared by Arnold Hara, Aubrey Moore and Roland Quitugua
February 12, 2015
The Center's Invasive Species program (headed by Kassim Al-Khatib) develops networks and protocols to address invasive species that are less visible nationally and are less well funded than nationally important species. A subgroup on Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle should be formed because of its regional importance, to focus attention on this insect through white papers and symposia, and to develop response protocols and collaborative grant proposals.
The CRB subgroup will meet during the afternoon of April 3 in conjunction with the Hawaiian Entomology Society's Pacic Entomology Conference to be held in the Hilton Waikiki Beach Hotel.
