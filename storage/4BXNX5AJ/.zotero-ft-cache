optimum level of inoculum to use. Therefore, the objectives in this study were to evaluate the potential of applying wet (drenching) and dry (broadcasting) forms of M. anisopliae inoculum and estimate the optimum inoculum level to use.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Assessment of M anisopliae in Laboratory
Source of isolates. Four isolates ofiW anisopliae were used (Table 1) - Bp and MO from Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia and Ma and Ml from adults and larvae of 0. rhinoceros collected in Teluk Merbau Estate, Sepang, Selangor. These isolates were maintained on malt extract agar (MEA) (Oxoid, Unipath. Ltd. England) at 28°C & 1°C (Joan Maxi Artic) in the dark. The spore dimensions of the isolates were measured. The spore length for Bp and MO were between 12-14 pm, and for Ma and Ml 6-8 pm. According to the system of Tulloch (1979) and Rombach et al. (19871, Bp and MO were identified as M. anisopliae var. major, and Ma and Ml as 1M. anisopliae var. anisopliae.
Source of insect. Various stages of 0. rhinoceros larvae were collected from the Jendarata Estate, United Plantations Bhd., Teluk Intan. The larvae were maintained in plastic containers of 48.0 cm x 33.0 cm x 26.0 cm (length x widthxheight), each containing 3.0-3.5 kg (50%60% moisture content) of decayed oil palm tissues. Forty to 50 larvae were placed in each container and kept at 25°C + 5°C for a week prior

to the experiment. The larvae were surface sterilized by washing in 0.3% (v/v) sodium hyphoclorite for 30 set, rinsing twice with sterilized distilled water, and air drying for 5-10 min prior to treatment.
Inoculation and bioassay. Spore suspensions were prepared by adding sterilized distilled water containing 0.2% (v/v) Tween 80 (BDH, Lab. Supp. England) to two-week-old MEA plates. Spores were scraped off from the surface of the medium using a sterilized ‘L’ shaped inoculation needle, and transferred into a screwcapped universal bottles. After vortexing for 2 min, the spores were separated from the debris by filtering through sterilized glass wool. The spore concentration was estimated using an improved Neubauer hemocytometer and adjusted to lOa conidia ml-l by dilution with 0.2% (v/v> Tween 80.
0. rhinoceros larvae were inoculated by dipping in the spore suspensions for 30 sec. Inoculated larvae were transferred into plastic containers of 37 cm x 26.5 cm x 10.5 cm (length x width x height), containing a sterilized mixture of 1.5 kg (50%-60% moisture content) cowdung, 0.5 kg (dry weight) frond fibre and 0.5 kg (dry weight) chipped frond of oil palms. The fibre and chipped frond were soaked in distilled water for 30 min before use. All containers were kept at 25°C & 5°C. To maintain the moisture content in the containers, 20 ml of sterilized distilled water were sprayed onto the surface of the mixture daily. One hundred larvae of 0. rhinoceros were used to bioassay each isolate of M. anisopliae. The larvae were divided into

five containers (20 per container) prepared as above. The first three containers were allocated third instars (L3), and the fourth and fifth containers second instars (L2) and first instars (Ll), respectively. The numbers of dead larvae were recorded daily until one of the treatments achieved 100% mortality. All dead larvae were collected for confirmation of Metczrhizium infection.
Confirmation of infection. The dead larvae were washed with distilled water to remove soil and air dried for 5 min. They were then surface sterilized with 0.3% (v/v> sodium hyphoclorite, followed by double rinsing with sterilized distilled water before being air dried again for 10 min. Ten to 15 larvae were transferred into a transparent plastic container of 17.5 cm x 12.0 cm x 6.5 cm (length x width xheight) and kept at 25°C + 5°C. Wetted paper towel (Scott paper, Malaysia) was placed at the bottom of the containers. This was to maintain high humidity in the containers, so that mycosis can develop. The numbers of larvae with mycosis symptoms were recorded daily.
Assessment of M. anisopliae in Field
Sites and experimental design. A field experiment was conducted in December 1996, in an oil palm to oil palm replanting area with seven-month-old heaps of chipped oil palm trunks at Jenderata Estate, United Plantations Bhd., Teluk Intan. The experiment was a randomized complete block design (RCBD). The heaps were divided into four blocks in a row. Each block contained six plots of 10.0 m x 2.0 m (length x width) or 20 m2. Between blocks and within plots were separated by removing the heaps at 2.0 m and 1.0 m, respectively. Plots were equally divided into 20 subplots, giving each subplot an area of a square metre. In each plot, four subplots (4 m2) were sampled each month, with the number of live and dead larvae, pupae and adults recorded by sifting through the oil palm heaps. The percentage mortality and population of 0. rhinoceros were estimated using this approach.
Production of inoculum. Metarhizium inoculum was produced on semi-ground maize. Maize

(200 g) was soaked in water for 15-20 min, air dried for 5 min and transferred into a poly propylene bag of 356 mm x 229 mm (length x width). The filled bags were autoclaved at 121°C for 20 min before inoculation with 3 ml Metarhizium conidia (lo6 conidia ml-l). The inoculated bags were maintained at 25°C in complete darkness. Two- to three-week-old inoculum was used in this experiment.
Fungal inocultcm and delivery methods, Fungal conidia were applied as wet and dry forms ofinoculum. For wet application, inoculum was harvested by thoroughly mixing well. sporulated bags with 250 ml 0.2% Tween 80 solution. Spore suspensions were filtered through a 250 pm sieve before adjusting to the desired concentrations for stock solution. The stock inoculum was kept in a refrigerator at 5°C before the experiment. Fungal inoculum wac delivered by drenching using a hydraulic sprayer (Solo 475, Germany) equipped with a 5/64- inch fan nozzle. Each experimental plot was drenchet separately with 10 litres ofwater that was adder with lo8 (Dch-lOa), log (Dch-log) and lOlo (Dch lOlo) conidia. Water used was from the fielc drains. For dry inoculum, plots were broad casted with inoculated maize at 3 kg plot-l (Brd 3 kg) and 6 kg plot-l (Brd-6 kg). Only a single application was applied.
Density of viable inoculum in soil. Thhc density ofviable inoculum was estimated monthl: for three months after treatment. A PO0 g ofsoi mixture (topsoil with some decayed oil paln tissues) was sampled from subplots recorded The samples were mixed thoroughly and placec individually in plastic vials. One gramme wa, placed in a screw capped universal bottle, 10 m of sterilized distilled water added, and the1 vortexed for 1 min at 8 revolutions sec.‘. The soi aliquot was diluted 10 times with sterilizec distilled water. Three hundred microlitres o the aliquot were streaked onto 90 mm selectivl medium (modified from Mohan et al., 1982 plates using a sterilized ‘L’ shaped glass rod. Th medium compositions were peptone, 1.00 1 (Difco); yeast extract, 0.50 g (Difco); $HPO, 0.58 g (Univar); KH,PO,, 1.00 g (Hambur; Chemical GmbH); MgS0,.7H,O, 1.00 g (BDH: rose’ bengal, 0.07 g (Sigma); chloramphenicol

0.20 g (Sigma); mycological agar, 25.50 g (Difco) anddistilled water, 1 litre. The pH ofthe medium was adjusted to 6.4. The medium was then autoclaved at 121°C for 20 min. Before pouring, an antibiotic mixture of cycloheximide, 0.20 g (Sigma); streptomycin sulphate, 0.10 g (Sigma); chlorotetracycline, 0.05 g (Sigma), and hexadecyl , tri-methyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), 0.19 g (ICN) was incorporated into the medium. Plates were incubated at 28°C f 1°C. The density of viable spores was estimated in numbers of colony forming units (cfu) at 7-10 days after incubation. Effects ofwater on spore viability. To study the above effect, samples of water were collected from field drains in the experimental area, a river and an ex-tin mining pool. The pH was determined and 10 ml of unsterilized water was used to adjust spore suspensions to a final concentration of lo6 conidia ml-l. For the control, sterilized distilled water was used. Two hundred microlitres of each sample were streaked onto four plates of potato dextrose agar (PDA) containing 0.02% antibiotic (chloramphenicol). Spore germination was estimated after 18 hr incubation at 28°C + 1°C. In each plate, 15 observations were made, with more than 100 eonidia per observation. This gave a total counted conidia of more than 1500 per water sample. The spore viability was estimated at 3, 24 and 48 hr after preparation.

Data analysis. The percentage cumulative mortality, percentage infected larvae in the laboratory assessment, percentage mortality in field experiment, and percentage germination of conidia and densities ofthe viable spores were angular-transformed before analysis by PRO@ GLM (SAS, 1991). Data on field populations of rhinoceros beetles (aduhs, pupae and all larval stages) were analysed without transformation. The lethal time 50% (LTJ values were probit analysed based on percent mycosis following the method of Finley (1971) and Wigley and Kalmakoff (1977). The means for all parameters were compared by Duncan’s multiple range test at P=O.O5 (SAS, 1991). Correlations between spore density and mortality, and total population of Oryctes were carried out using SigmaSTAT software (SigmaSTAT, 1995).
RESULTS Assessment of IM. anisopliae in Laboratory
The percentage cumulative mortality of 8. rhinoceros larvae treated with lo6 eonidia ml-l is shown in Table 2. At 8 to 12 days after treatment (DAT), all isolates caused significantly higher (P<O.O5) mortality than the control. At this stage, the long-spored isolates caused significantly higher (P<O.O5) mortality than short-spored isolates. Bp caused 100%

Assessment of M. anisopliae in Field
The effects 0% M. anisopliae on total mortality (larvae, pupae and adults) of rhinoceros beetle could be seen as early as one month after

At two-month after treatment (MAT), mortality with drenching (30.8%, N = 216) and broadcasting (36.6%, N = 270) were significantly higher (P~0.05) at the highest application rate than in the control (2.30/c, N = 240) (Figure 2b). However, there was no increased mortality (P>O.O5) from drenching ‘with lOa and log conidia plot-l, and broadcasting at 3 kg plot-l.

2). Similar studies were conducted by Latch (19761, Sivapragasam and Tey (19951, but the time taken for each isolate to kill 50% larvae (LT,,) was not estimated. The LT,, values for long-spored isolates were 9.1 days (Bp) and 8.9 days (MO), shorter than short-spored isolates, which were 10 days (Ma), and 14 days (Ml) (Table 4).

The percentage infections by isolates Bp and MO were 75% and 71%, respectively (Figure I). These were slightly higher than that reported by Sivapragasam and Tey (1995) who had only one out of three long-spored isolates causing over 70% infection. The higher infection in this study could have been due to the stage of larvae used as only L3 larvae were used by Sivapragasam and Tey (1995). This study used the early

instars as well and the early instars are more susceptible than the later ones (Latch, 1976).
The infection 0fMetarhizium is normally via spores that adhere to the cuticle. Under suitable conditions, the spores germinate and penetrate the cuticle (St Leger et al., 1991). At the site of penetration, brown or black lesions will appear as an early sign of mycosis (Charnley, 1992). In our study, lesions were scattered on the cuticle of the larvae and death usually ensured shortly thereafter. In a few cases, the larvae died without symptom, but were later covered by green spores of M. anisopliae. In such larvae, penetration by spores may have been through the gut. Although this remains uncertain, it has been reported on the subterranean termites, Reticulitermes sp., by Kramm and West (1982).
In the field trial, some infection by Metarhizium also occurred in the control plots, although the incidence was very low (Figure 2). Most of the infected Oryctes were adults and L3 larvae - they were, therefore, possible migrants from the neighbouring treated areas. In the treated plots, healthy adults from other areas

After death, the diseased adul became a secondary source of inoculum, infer ing Oryctes breeding in the area. In our tri: migration of infected adults into the contr plots is suspected because of the close proximi of the plots (2 m apart). This view is support1 by the results of Latch and Falloon (1976) WI found infected adults to have migrated to conti plots as far as 300-400 m away.

abiotic factors such as low humidity, high temperature and ultraviolet radiation (Zimmermann, 1982; Walstad et al., 1970; Moore et al., 1993) which reduce their viability.
Due to the substantial quantity of maize required to produce dry Metarhizium inoculum, wet inoculum may be preferable as less maize is required. Based on our production rate’ of 4.4 x lOlo conidia 200 gof autoclaved maize, wet inoculum requires only 1.4 kg maize ha-l (estimated area of chipped oil palm trunks is 600 m2), while dry inoculum requires 180 kg. At a maize price RM 1.00 kg-l, the cost of application based on maize alone is RM 1.40 for wet inoculum versus RM 180.00 for dry inoculum. However, the main advantage of using dry inoculum is that it can be stored at room temperature for several months before use.
CONCLUSION
Our study has proved that M. anisopliae var. major or the so-called long-spored isolate is highly virulent against the larvae of 0. rhinoceros beetle. In the field, this isolate could infect all stages of the pest, with particular effectiveness on L3 larvae. Both wet and dry inoculum by drenching were equally effective in controlling Oryctes in the field. At the highest application rate (drenching at lOlo conidia plot-l and broadcasting at 6 kg plot-l) both methods drastically reduced the L3 population. For wet inoculum, the amount of maize needed to treat one hectare is 1.4 kg (equal to 3.08 x loll conidia ha-l), and for dry inoculum 180 kg (equal to 3.96 x 10P3 conidia ha-l). Therefore, this pathogen is more economically applied in wet form using water easily available in the field.
The results show that M. anisopliae is effective in reducing the larval population of the Oryctes. Further reduction in the population of 0. rhinoceros, especially adults, can be achieved by combining M. anisopliae with Baculovirus oryctes. The virus will shorten the life span of adults and has proven effective in suppressing the beetle population in several Pacific regions (Zelazny et al., 1992). Application of these two pathogens for Oryctes control is cheap, and environmentally friendly and helps reduce the over dependence on chemical insecticides.

Therefore, further research on the subject vital for long term sustainability of the sil pa industry.
