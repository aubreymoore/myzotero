Can We Help Your Citizen Science Project? >

At Wild Me, high technology and citizen science are telling the amazing stories of animals' lives.

Wildlife research in the 21st century will be an amazing blend of drones with advanced computer vision, massive data collection by citizen scientists, and the integration of artificial intelligence to help make sense of it all. We are starting to have unprecedented insight into the complex and rich lives of the wildlife we study. Through advanced computing, we're bringing their stories to you.

It starts with good science. Click on a project below to learn more about our work on wildlife + citizen science + artificial intelligence.

Have you seen a whale shark?

 

 

The Wildbook for Whale Sharks photo-identification library is an award-winning visual database of whale shark ( Rhincodon typus ) encounters and of individually catalogued whale sharks. The library is maintained and used by marine biologists to collect and analyze whale shark sighting data to learn more about these amazing creatures.

The Wildbook uses photographs of the skin patterning behind the gills of each shark, and any scars, to distinguish between individual animals. Cuttin g-edge software supports rapid identification using pattern recognition and photo management tools.
