(()-4-Methyloctanoic acid and its ethyl ester are aggregation pheromones of many rhinoceros beetles of the genus Oryctes and are investigated for the control of these pests by olfactory trapping. A simple, economical, and high-yield (>50%) synthesis of (()-4-methyloctanoic acid and its ethyl ester is presented starting from n-hexanal. The key step in this sequence is an orthoester Claisen rearrangement for the elongation of the carbon chain by two.

INTRODUCTION
Rhinoceros beetles of the genus Oryctes are the main pests of coconut and date palm plantations in Southeast Asia, North Africa, and some Pacific islands (1-3). Adult beetles burrow galleries in the fresh and growing point of palms for feeding. The damage is particularly severe when apical buds in young trees or the fruit stalks in producing trees are attacked. Despite the use of high doses of insecticides (e.g., carbofuran and cypermethrin) against most rhinoceros beetles (4), efficient and acceptable methods of controlling these insects are still lacking, because adults spend more of their life hidden in galleries and rapidly colonize new feeding and breeding sites, flying easily away from the initial colony. The idea to manipulate adult populations by luring beetles into traps with specific attractants was investigated in the 1970s (5). The attractant chosen at that time, ethyl chrysanthemate, was rapidly abandoned because of insufficient catches. More recently, it was reported (1-3) that the main male pheromone emitted from most of the Oryctes species is a blend of 4-methyloctanoic acid (1) and its ethyl ester (2) (Figure 1) and that these species appear to use 1 and 2 differently and modulate the released amounts under certain circumstances. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the ethyl 4-methyloctanoate (2) is the aggregation pheromone of the tropical Oryctes rhinoceros (1, 2) and of Oryctes monoceros (6-8), whereas 4-methyloctanoic acid (1) is the aggregation pheromone of Oryctes elegans (3). Both substances have been studied (1-3) in adequate traps and proved to be powerful attractants in operational programs to control the major pest in oil palm plantations.
Besides its activity as a pheromone, 4-methyloctanoic acid is also cited in the literature for its contribution to the aroma of

various foods (9-11). However, no information about the absolute configuration of this naturally occurring substance is available.
Field experiments revealed that synthetic pheromones 1 and 2 in their racemic forms are very efficient attractants, indicating that chirality is not a critical point in the pheromone activity of Oryctes species (1, 3, 9-11).
A prerequisite for the application of aggregation pheromones in large trapping areas is the availability of cheap 4-methyloctanoic acid (1) of high purity in sufficient quantities. To date, different approaches have been reported for the synthesis of racemic 4-methyloctanoic acid and its esters. Among the most general ones are (a) reaction of 4-ketopentanoic acid or its ethyl ester with the appropriate Grignard reagent for the elongation of the chain (12); (b) reductive desulfurization of bithienyl carboxylic acids (13); (c) methylation of N-tert-butylimine derivative of hexanal, condensation with malonic acid, and hydrogenation (14); (d) conjugate addition of organocuprates to ethyl acrylate (1, 6) or Ni-catalyzed coupling of alkyliodides with ethyl acrylate (7); and, finally, (e) chain elongation of 2-methylhexanoic acid via malonic ester synthesis (15) or via reduction and elongation of the chain by the Wittig reaction (16). Concerning the optically active 4-methyloctanoic acid, one asymmetric synthesis has been reported (16), and two others used enantiopure 2-alkyl-branched acids (17) or natural citronellol (1) as starting material. Resolution of the racemic acid

by a lipase-mediated enantioselective esterification has also been described (18-20).
The above presented methods involve not readily available substrates (13, 14), starting materials already lacking the methyl group (15, 16), or the use of organometallic syntheses (1, 6, 7, 12) unsuitable for large-scale preparations.
Addressing the drawbacks of the existing methods, we were looking for an alternative synthesis of racemic 4-methyloctanoic acid (1), which should be simple, low cost, and workable on large scale. The proposed synthetic route is outlined in Scheme 1.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All reagents and solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used as supplied. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on 0.25 mm precoated silica gel 60 F254 aluminum sheets and column chromatography on silica gel 60 (0.063-0.2 mm) as well as silica gel 60 (<0.063 mm), products of Merck & Co. (Darmstadt, Germany). IR spectra were obtained in CCl4 solutions (5%) on a PerkinElmer 247 spectrophotometer. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 on a Varian Mercury 200 MHz spectrometer, with TMS as an internal standard. Gas chromatography-mass sprectrometry analyses were carried out with a GC-MS Hewlett-Packard 5890-5970 system, equipped with a 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. SPB-1 fused silica capillary column: carrier gas, helium, 1 mL/min; injector temperature, 230 °C; oven temperature, 50 °C (5 min isothermal) raised at 4 °C/ min to 250 °C; ion source temperature, 220 °C; interface temperature, 250 °C; mass range, 40-500 amu; EI, 70 eV.

2-Methylenehexanol (5). To a cold (5 °C) suspension of NaBH4 (2.75 g, 0.072 mol) in H2O (20 mL) and 5% NaHCO3 (6.8 mL) was added a cold solution of aldehyde 4 (8.00 g, 0.072 mol) in methanol (100 mL). The final solution was stirred for 1 h at 5 °C. The reaction mixture was then poured into ice water (220 mL), followed by the addition of 10% HCl (35 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 100 mL); the combined organic layers were washed

with brine, dried with anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure to leave a clear oily product. The product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (1:1 petroleum ether/diethyl ether) to give the allyl alcohol 5 (7.35 g, 90%; purity by GC ) 97%) as a colorless oil: IR, cm-1 3624; 1H NMR δ 0.88 (t, 3H, J ) 7.2 Hz), 1.14-1.49 (m, 4H), 2.03 (t, 2H, J ) 7.2 Hz), 2.37 (s, 1H), 4.04 (s, 2H), 4.82-4.85 (m, 1H), 4.97-4.98 (m, 1H); 13C NMR δ 13.87, 22.43, 29.89, 32.63, 65.77, 108.85, 149.17; 1H NMR and 13C NMR values are in accordance with the literature data (22).
Ethyl 4-Methyleneoctanoate (6). A mixture of the 2-methylenehexanol 5 (6.50 g, 0.057 mol), triethyl orthoacetate (55 mL, 0.29 mol), and a catalytic amount of propionic acid (4 drops) was heated at 138 °C for 5 h with continuous removal of the ethanol formed during the reaction. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, poured into ice water (150 mL) containing NaHCO3 (1.0 g), and extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 50 mL). The organic phase was washed with water, dried with Na2SO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (8:1 petroleum ether/diethyl ether) to give 6 (7.94 g, 76%; purity by GC ) 98%), as a colorless oil: IR, cm-1 1736, 1645; 1H NMR δ 0.80-0.91 (m, 3H), 1.19-1.26 (t, 3H, J ) 7,2 Hz), 1.05-1.48 (m, 4H,), 1.96-2.06 (m, 2H), 2.30-2.47 (m, 4H), 4.10 (q, 2H, J ) 7.2 Hz), 4.67 (s, 1H), 4.71 (s, 1H); 13C NMR δ 13.90, 14.18, 22.36, 29.88, 30.81, 32.74, 35.92, 60.24, 109.0, 148.22, 173.31; EI-MS, m/z (%) 184 (M+, 3), 142 (21), 110 (19), 96 (70), 69 (100), 41 (98), 55 (97).

The reaction mixture, after cooling, was added into water (60 mL) and was extracted with diethyl ether (2 × 25 mL) to remove any remaining ester 2 and neutral impurities as well. The aqueous phase was acidified to pH 2 by the addition of 10% HCl (5 mL) and was extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 20 mL). The organic phase was washed with water, dried with anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give pure acid 1 (2.14 g, 95%; purity by GC ) 98%) as a colorless oil: IR, cm-1 1710; 1H NMR δ 0.84-0.90 (m, 6H), 1.10-1.52 (m, 8H), 1.56-1.80 (m, 1H), 2.29-2.38 (m, 2H), 11.45 (s, 1H); 13C NMR δ 14.07, 19.21, 22.91, 29.09, 31.59, 31.88, 32.27, 36.27, 180.58; EIMS, m/z (%) 129 (M+ - 29, 3), 101 (27), 99 (32), 83 (17), 73 (60), 60 (30), 57 (100), 55 (55), 43 (77), 41 (50). The mass spectrum is in accordance with the literature data (3).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Hexanal, a common cheap aldehyde, was the starting material of our synthesis. Mannich reaction (23) of hexanal (3) with formaldehyde and dimethylammonium chloride gave 2-methylenehexanal (4) (88%). This was subsequently reduced by sodium borohydride in methanol, to give the allylic alcohol 5 in high yield (90%). The Claisen rearrangement (24) of the intermediate formed by heating alcohol 5 with triethyl orthoacetate in the presence of propionic acid gave the ethyl 4-methyleneoctanoate (6) (76%). This new compound, identified by its spectroscopic data, is the key element of the present approach. Finally, hydrogenation of an ethanolic solution of 6 in the presence of 10% Pd/C gave ethyl 4-methyloctanoate (2) in high yield (92%). Saponification of the ethyl ester 2 gave 4-methyloctanoic acid (1) almost quantitatively and in high purity.

Although no efforts have been made to optimize the yields, the above reactions gave sufficient quantities of products that can be easily purified either by distillation or by a rapid column chromatography.
In conclusion, a facile procedure for the preparation of ethyl 4-methyloctanoate (2), the aggregation pheromone of O. rhinoceros and O. monoceros, and 4-methyloctanoic acid (1), a major component of the aggregation pheromone of O. elegans, is reported herein. Both substances can be easily prepared in four-five simple steps from hexanal in >50% yields. The starting material and other reagents used are common and inexpensive, and the reactions are suitable for a large-scale preparation.
