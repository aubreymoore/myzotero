OBSEEVATIONS ON THE ECOLOGY OF ORYCTES (COLEOPTEEA: SCAEABAEIDAE: DYNASTINAE)
IN MADAGASCAR

PLATES IV-VII
(Received 28th March 1968) In May, 1966, the author was sent under the auspices of the United Nations/South Pacific Commission Rhinoceros Beetle Project* to Madagascar and the Comores Archipelago to conduct an investigation of the natural enemies of the species of Oryctes occurring there. The object of this study was to search for parasites, predators and diseases of these beetles, which might be introduced to the islands of the South Pacific to control the introduced Oryctes rhinoceros (L.) which has become a serious pest of coconut palms in the area. Eleven species of Oryctes occur in Madagascar, and five species in the islands of the Comores Archipelago (Paulian, 1959). In Madagascar the major plantations of coconut palms occur on the north and central west coast; in other coastal areas the coconut palms are scattered in gardens, around villages, or in avenues along streets, and are not in general planted in large regular plantations. Most localities mentioned in the text are shown on Fig. 1. On the west coast of Madagascar there is a marked seasonal difference in rainfall, the climate being very dry, almost rainless, from May to November, while the season of rains usually occurs from December to April. On the east coast there is no marked seasonal difference in rainfall, the climate being humid throughout the year. Throughout this paper the abbreviations LI, L2 and L3 are used to denote first-, second- and third-instar larvae of Oryctes, respectively.
Damage by Oryctes to coconut palms in Madagascar Details of damage by Oryctes to large coconut plantations, and smaller
plantings, in the various coastal areas of Madagascar visited, are presented in Table I.
It appeared, in the main, that on the large coconut plantations, e.g., Ankivanja, Andilana, where plantation sanitation involving the destruction of breeding sites (dead standing coconut palms, decaying coconut trunks and stumps) is carried out regularly, damage to the crowns of the palms is kept at a very low level. On the other hand, a coconut plantation at Mahilaka which had been destroyed by Oryctes (Plate IV, fig. 1), contained many dead standing palms that provided abundant breeding sites.
In large plantations such as Madiromiarina, Ampanitoina, Mahilaka and Vohemar, where there are sections containing a smaller number of very tall old

palms among many younger shorter palms, the attacks of Oryctes seemed to be particularly concentrated on the crowns of the tall palms while the shorter palms were slightly attacked or had escaped attack completely. Perhaps this is because the crowns of tall coconut palms towering over lower palms are relatively more conspicuous and so more readily found by the beetles when in flight.
Breeding sites
Coconut wood Dead standing •palms and stumps.—Examples of Oryctes breeding in the
tops of dead standing coconut palms in various coastal locations in Madagascar are presented in Table II.
Larvae of Oryctes, and a smaller number of adults, often occur in a large central hole up to 4 m. long in the top of the dead coconut palm (Plate IV, fig. 2). The hole is filled with moist chewed rotten wood, dark brown or black in colour, and moist faecal pellets (frass). Considerable numbers of large larvae (on the north west coast often third instars of 0. gigas Lap.) can occur together in these holes, and each larva does not occupy a separate gallery (Plate V, fig. 1). Though Oryctes larvae will bite readily when disturbed, they can apparently live together in large holes filled with a soft medium of chewed wood and frass without injuring one another.
When tall dead standing palms were felled, the tops often smashed open on hitting the ground, and the larvae were ejected. Some larvae rapidly turned blue, with symptoms of the so-called " blue disease ", and died. Dissection showed the foregut to be ruptured. This confirms the finding of Marschall (1963), that in consequence of an external trauma, for instance, by the shock of a falling palm tree, one or more of the delicate diverticles of the gut may rupture, oozing liquid poisons into the haemolymph, thus causing the blue colour, which within minutes spreads from the wound throughout the body.
An adult of 0. gigas was found in the top of a dead standing palm at Bethell near Morondava. It is interesting to note that this is the first report of this species occurring so far south along the west coast.
Decaying coconut logs.—Examples of Oryctes breeding in decaying coconut logs are presented in Table III.
Sometimes considerable numbers of large larvae occur together in the hollowed out interior of a rotting log filled with moist chewed wood and frass. Elsewhere the larvae occupy individual galleries separate from one another.
Larvae move to firm intact parts of the wood for pupation. For instance, in the plantation at Mahilaka in October a small coconut stump was found to have the upper part filled with moist chewed wood and frass, while the basal part consisted of moist, but still intact wood in which 15 pupae of 0. gigas were embedded head uppermost, each in its separate cell.
Satra trunks Larvae of Oryctes (probably gigas) breed in quite high numbers in decaying
logs and trunks of " satra " (Medemia sp., Borasseae) in the dry scrub surrounding the coconut plantation at Ankivanja. One piece of rotten dry satra trunk, 3-6 m. long, contained 40 L3 in a central tunnel filled with wood powder and frass. Another similar piece, 1-9 m. long, contained 32 L3 and another, 2-4 m. in length, contained 15 L3 in a central tunnel filled with moderately moist chewed wood and frass. Though decaying satra trunks are quite dry externally, a moderate amount of moisture is retained in the parts inhabited by larvae of Oryctes.
In a very dry sandy plain with numerous scattered clumps of satra palms near Ambolobozokely in the north-east of Madagascar, one piece of decaying satra trunk, 4 m. long, was found to contain two Oryctes L3 with much dry wood

powder. However, though there is much decaying satra wood in this region, larvae of Oryctes were rarely found.
Other decaying wood In forests.—Larvae of Oryctes were not commonly found in the forests of
Madagascar. This may be due to a limitation in food supply for the adults, as the indigenous palms are scattered among many other different types of plants and may be difficult for the adults to locate. Also adults may experience difficulty in finding suitable breeding sites in the forest, whereas coconut logs and stumps in plantations and villages provide them in abundance.
Details of Oryctes breeding sites found in forests are presented in Table IV.

G. 0. BEDFORD

In open cleared areas.—Larvae were found in decaying logs and stumps in open cleared areas, away from both forests and coconut palms. Just north of Soanierana Ivongo on the central east coast, in an open area between the beach and a swamp, a pupa of 0. simiar Coq. was found in hard wood in a partly decayed stump (not coconut). Another log on the ground was mostly hard, but contained two Oryctes L3 in a rotten layer just under the bark.
At Ivoloina near the Agricultural Station just north of Tamatave on the east coast, two pieces of moist decaying Niaoulis wood at the edge of a rice field each contained one Oryctes L3. Another piece of Niaoulis contained an Oryctes pupa. Small numbers of Cetoniid, Lucanid and Cerambycid larvae were also present. One moist, soft, but not very rotten piece of " Tulipier du Gabon " (Spathodea campanulata) trunk contained one L2 and one L3 Oryctes.
Oasis of Ilakaka.—At Ilakaka in the interior of Madagascar on the western v edge of the very dry Massif d'Isalo, there is an oasis and stream dominated by many tall " Vakaka " palms (Ravenala madagascariensis), and by " Fandra " palms (Pandanus humbertianus). The Vakaka palms are nearly always in the centre of the oasis standing in the water, whereas the Fandra palms are mostly at the edge, though they can occur among the Vakaka palms. The oasis is surrounded by vast dry prairie grasslands with scattered Medemia palms.
Some 24 moist decaying palm trunks and stumps were examined in the oasis in March, but only six contained larvae of Oryctes. One old Vakaka stump filled with moist rotten wood and soil contained three LI, nine L2 and eight L3 Oryctes. Another old Vakaka stump filled with moist rotting wood contained one adult female of 0. ranavalo Coq. There was no evidence of Oryctes damage to the crowns of the palms in the oasis.

Decaying wood of Albizia
In the coffee plantations along the south-east coast of Madagascar trees of Albizia stipulata have often been grown as high shade for coffee. There is often a considerable amount of decaying Albizia wood in the plantations, and this is used by Oryctes for breeding. About 10 km. west of Mananjary a decaying trunk of Albizia at the edge of a coffee plantation was found to contain galleries filled with frass and chewed wood which harboured eight Oryctes L3, also one Lucanid larva and one Lucanid adult. Some of the Oryctes L3 contained numerous white cysts in the abdomen symptomatic of a protozoan gregarine infection.
At Manakana, about 20 km. west of Mananjary, in a gallery in a moist decaying stump of Albizia, one Oryctes L3 was found which clearly showed many white gregarine cysts in the abdomen.
In the coffee plantation of the Soci^te Nantaise along the banks of the Mananjary River about 20 km. west of Mananjary, one piece of decaying Albizia, 3 m. long, was found to contain five Oryctes L3 in separate galleries with frass and chewed wood, also one pupa of Oryctes. One of the larvae was in a cell 2 cm. from the surface of the log. One moist rotten trunk of Albizia 5-85 m. long contained seven L2 and nine L3 Oryctes also one Oryctes pupa dead and blackened. One piece of moist rotten Albizia 2 m. long contained one L3, also one adult female of 0. simiar in an oval cell 5 cm. long and 3 cm. high, 5 cm. from the surface of the log.

Raphia
Larvae of Oryctes were occasionally found in decaying Raphia trunks. In December at Aniribe on the Isle Sainte Marie off the east coast of Madagascar three decaying Raphia trunks, moist and rotten inside, were found to contain one L I and one L2 Oryctes, and one brown Elaterid larva. On Isle des Nattes

THE ECOLOGY OF ORYCTES IN MADAGASCAR

93

at the southern tip of Isle Sainte Marie, one Baphia trunk, moist, partly fibrous and partly rotten, contained two L2 and six L3 Oryctes. Another moist rotten Baphia trunk contained one adult female of 0. ranavalo.
Near Nosy Varika on the central east coast in January one decaying Raphia trunk in a rice field contained one pupa of Oryctes covered with white Metarrhizium, another dead pupa, two living pupae, one dead L3 and two living adults of 0. simiar. Another piece of Baphia contained one dead L3 and one dead adult of 0. simiar.
In the forest of Anakarafantsika on the central west coast, one piece of moist Baphia trunk contained one pair of elytra of an Oryctes and larval faecal pellets, but no larvae.
Maize and rice husks In February, in a heap of old well-decayed maize husks at Bethell near
Morondava on the west coast, five dead adult specimens of 0. boas were found, also eight L2 or L3, and in some heaps of rice husks an adult male of this species was found.
Manure In February, at Antasakamirohaka near Morondava, some 179 healthy larvae
of Oryctes, mainly L2 and L3, were found in approximately 6-3 square metres of dry manure at the edge of a cattle pen.
In April, in the village of Ambondrobe, on the plateau about 46 km. south of Betroka, 90 healthy larvae of Oryctes, mostly L3, and two Cetoniid larvae were found in about 0-8 square metres of dry manure at the edge of a cattle pen. The remains of a dead adult of Oryctes were also found. The occurrence of Oryctes larvae in this habitat is very interesting as there are no palms in the village, which is surrounded by savannah grassland with scattered trees, but with apparently no forest or jungle with native palms, or coconut palms.

Feeding sites
Coconut palms and coconut seedlings Adults of 0. gigas and 0. blucheaui Fairm. were found with larvae in the
tops of dead standing coconut palms on the north-west coast, and presumably these adults attack the crowns of living coconut palms.
At Marovoay near Morondava in February a male and a female of 0. simiar were extracted from a vertical hole 66 cm. long which they had made in the heart of a coconut palm about six years old. The female had 23 large mature eggs in the ovaries. At Betanimena near Tulear in March an adult of 0. simiar was found in a hole about 60 cm. long in the heart of a five-year-old coconut palm.
In December at Antetezambe near Maroantsetra on the east coast, one adult male of 0. simiar was removed from a hole at the base of a frond on an eight-to-ten-year-old coconut palm. At Soanierana near Maroantsetra an adult of 0. simiar was removed from a hole 9-5 cm. long in a frond base through which it was attacking the heart of a five-year-old coconut palm. Just north of Tamatave, in the village of Ambodivolo in January, two adult males of O. simiar were found together in a hole in the heart of a coconut palm aged about eight years.
In the plantation at Antetikireja on the north-west coast, adults of 0. pyrrhus Burm. attack newly planted coconut seedlings, burrowing into the earth to make a hole at the junction of the stem and the nut. In a small clearing in the forest on the north-east coast near Cap Est seven adults of 0. pyrrhus were collected by searching in the soil close around the bases of some coconut

94

seedlings that were being attacked. This was interesting, as the clearing was quite surrounded by forest; no adult coconut palms were present, and the coconut seedlings had been planted only recently, yet the adults of 0. pyrrhus had succeeded in locating them.
At Salazamay, close to Tamatave, there is a small plantation of coconut seedlings and palms aged about three years. These plants had been protected by lightly mixing aldrin dust with the surface soil around the base of each plant. On January 1, 1967, four adult males and two adult females of 0. pyrrhus were found dead on the soil around the base of one plant, having been killed by the insecticidal treatment when they had burrowed through the soil to attack the plant. Four dead adults of the same species were found around the bases of two other treated plants.

Oil palms At Ambariomiambina, about 8 km. west of Sambava on the north east
coast, there is a five-hectare stand of four-year-old oil palms planted in rows. These palms are often attacked by adults of 0. pyrrhus burrowing through the soil to make holes in the base (Plate V, fig. 2).
Ravenala and other forest palms Two Ravenala palms at Kianjavato had leaves attacked by Oryctes, and on
one of them, growing in a clump of bamboo, the beetle had made extensive holes at the base of the midrib of four leaves (Plate VI, fig. 1). An indigenous " Lafaha " palm growing in the forest of Ambatovaka near Kiankavato had three leaves that bore large V-shaped incisions typical of attack by Oryctes. In the forest at Perinet an unhealthy " Avinona " palm had five leaves that had been holed at the base by Oryctes. A " Letikitiky " palm had the crown stunted and bore only two leaves, each of which had the ends chewed in a V-shape, probably as the result of attack by Oryctes.

Bamboo On the I.F.C.C. Station at Kianjavato some 38 adults of 0. ranavalo were
found in holes in the moist lateritic soil at the bases of bamboo plants, attacking the roots (Plate VI, fig. 2). There is much bamboo in this area, and most of the plants were attacked in this way. One had a hole in the top of the shoot, apparently made by Oryctes. These adults of 0. ranavalo were collected in January and February, i.e., in the warm season when the rainfall is highest.

Banana plants At Ambia, about 6 km. east of Maroantsetra, in December a male adult of
0. simiar was found in the base of a leaf of a banana plant, having made a hole 85 cm. long in the midrib.

Parasites of larvae Scoliid wasps
Small numbers of Scoliid cocoons were found in decaying logs in various parts of Madagascar but were not common in any locality investigated. Data on these findings are presented in Table V. The following cases are of interest. In coastal rainforest south of Antongopahitra, a very rotten, moist, mosscovered log was found to contain three Scoliid cocoons (one of which was empty), and galleries filled with chewed wood contained three Lucanid larvae. One of the living Scoliid cocoons occurred in a small oval gallery filled with moist chewed wood powder, apparently made by a Lucanid larva, situated well within the log away from the surface. This suggests that Scoliids may parasitise

Lucanid larvae, in addition to larvae of Oryctes which also occur in this locality (see Table IV).
At Fenerive a decaying coconut log 1-5 m. long, hard externally, hollow and rotten inside and filled with moist dark brown wood powder, was found to contain five Scoliid cocoons, of which three were empty, one was shrivelled and one unopened. A small number of Oryctes L2, Lucanid adults and a Lucanid larva were present.
In the tropical rainforest near Perinet a moss-covered log, very moist and rotten, lying across a stream above the water, contained 15 Cetoniid larvae in a number of galleries, and two Scoliid cocoons. Another moist, moss-covered rotting log lying on other branches with one end in a stream, also contained 14 Cetoniid larvae and two Scoliid cocoons. Adults of a species of Scolia were later reared from these cocoons. The association of Cetoniid larvae and cocoons of Scolia in the same log suggests that Scolia can parasitise Cetoniid larvae.
Among 39 decaying coconut trunks, stumps, and five dead standing coconut palms examined in the abandoned coconut plantation at Lokaro, only one breeding site was found to contain Scoliid cocoons. This was a small dead standing coconut trunk 4-5 m. high, the top half of which was filled with moist black rotten powder and contained nine Scoliid cocoons, along with three L2, 24 L3 Oryctes and one pupa of Oryctes.
Gregarines
As mentioned earlier, some larvae of Oryctes collected from a decaying Albizia trunk near Mananjary in January 1967 had prominent white cysts in the abdomen, clearly visible through the integument. The gregarine responsible has been identified as Stictospora kurdistana Theod., Eugregarina, and its development in the coelom of these larvae has been described by Tuzet and others (1967). A larva of Oryctes collected in August 1966 at Dzamandzar on the Isle of Nossi-Be contained 14 white cysts of which 12 were in a cluster on the inner surface of the body wall near the foregut. When the cysts were punctured a thick white paste of protozoan gregarine spores flowed out. Some of the cysts were brown or blackened, and possibly were undergoing encapsulation as a result of host defence reactions.
Larvae infected with the white gregarine cysts were not commonly found. At Dzamandzar only one larva of Oryctes out of 20 examined showed cysts, and at Ambinanikely (south-east coast) only one larva out of 32 collected in decaying coconut trunks was infected. Two larvae collected near Antalaha (north-east coast) were infected with cysts.
Some 39 decaying coconut trunks and stumps, and five dead standing palms, were examined at Lokaro in April, 1967, but only one stump contained any larvae infected with gregarine cysts. This stump was 1-4 m. high, and of 0-4 m. average diameter, firm outside and filled with moist powder and frass. It contained three L2 and two L3 Oryctes with many white gregarine cysts, and one L3 without cysts.
At Ankatafana near Mananajary in March, 1967, in a " Dara " palm stump and rootstock, about 0-8 m. in circumference and about 0-5 high and containing moist rotten dark brown wood powder, some 34 Oryctes L3 were found among the fibres and in the roots. A total of 23 of these L3 had from two to hundreds of white gregarine cysts clearly visible through the integument. Often hundreds of cysts occurred in masses in the abdomen between the gut and the body wall. The cysts appeared to be quite free in the body, for if the skin of an infested larvae was depressed, the cysts could easily be pushed about.
Some 18 Cetoniid larvae containing white gregarine cysts were found in decaying logs in the Montagne d'Ambre in the north of Madagascar.

THE ECOLOGY OF ORYCTES IN MADAGASCAR

97

Nematodes External nematodes.—Of 17 Oryctes larvae collected in coconut wood on
the ground in the plantation at Madiromiarina on 10 July, 1966, seven had masses of small white nematodes in the intersegmental creases on the anterior ventral surface and around the insertions of the legs. The larvae themselves appeared to be healthy. These nematodes were not found on any of 64 larvae collected from decaying coconut wood and dead standing coconut palms at Madiromiarina on August 15th and 17th.
Four out of 29 Oryctes larvae collected from decaying coconut trunks at Sosumav near Ambilobe in July also had white masses of external nematodes embedded in black material in the creases around the leg bases and in the overlapping intersegmental creases on the ventral surface.
Whether these nematodes are parasitic on the larvae or normally free-living in the decaying wood is not known, but the latter possibility is more likely as the larvae with nematodes on them did not seem to be unhealthy.
Internal nematodes.—Adult and larval Oxyurid nematodes (possibly Schwenkiella sp.) were found in the fermentation chamber of the gut of larvae of Oryctes. Some 25 per cent, of the larvae at Ankivanja contained 10 to 20 nematodes in the fermentation chamber. Nematodes also occurred in larvae of Oryctes from Sosumav, Madiromiarina, Mahilaka plantation and forest, Bermanja, Dzamandzar, Lokobe, Marovoay, Andramasay, Antsakomirohaka and Nahampoana (just north of Fort Dauphin). Cetoniid larvae from decaying logs in Ialatsara forest, Montagne d'Ambre, Ambariomiambina, Marovoasy and a locality 32 km. south of Baraketa also contained many nematodes in the fermentation chamber. Similar nematodes have been found in 33 per cent, of a sample of 100 larvae of 0. rhinoceros collected in Western Samoa. The gut of these nematodes contained a brownish material resembling digested wood so it is possible that they are not parasitic in the fermentation chamber of larval Oryctes, but merely commensal there.

Fungal disease

Cordyceps sp.—In the coconut plantation at Antsiraikiraiky on Isle Sainte Marie, of 34 Oryctes L3 found in December, 19 (about 56%) were infected with a species of Cordyceps. The larvae were dead in their galleries in the coconut logs and had large thick yellow cords of the fungus growing out from their bodies into the decaying coconut wood (Plate VII). For example, a rotting trunk on the ground, the wood being soft and moist with much chewed powder, contained four dead Oryctes L3 and two dead pupae with thick yellow fungal strands growing out from the bodies. Some of the dead larvae had both Cordyceps and white Metarrhizium fungi growing on them. Another moist coconut trunk with a powdery interior contained three L3 dead with yellow Cordyceps strands growing out, two L2 apparently still healthy and two Scoliid cocoons.
This was the only locality in Madagascar where larvae of Oryctes attacked by Cordyceps were found by the author. T. V. Venkatraman (A preliminary report of an investigation of the possibilities of biological control of the coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros (Linnaeus)).—South Pacific Commission cyclostyled paper, 1958) found one such larva killed by Cordyceps at Fenerive on the central east coast of Madagascar to the south of Isle Sainte Marie. J. Lepointe (Beport on the Oryctes problem in Madagascar.—South Pacific Commission cyelostyled report, 1960) found seven examples of larvae and pupae of Oryctes infested with fungus (possibly Isaria) on Isle Sainte Marie and on the mainland opposite.

their galleries in decaying logs as a result of infections by the green muscardine fungus M. anisopliae were rarely encountered. Only the following cases of apparent death due to Metarrhizium were recorded during the investigation. In the Mahilaka coconut plantation, of 94 larvae of Oryctes examined, only three had Metarrhizium infections. In the forest near Joffreville a piece of rotting wood, 70 cm. long, contained one Oryctes L2 larva covered with Metarrhizium. In the coconut plantation at Antsiraikiraiky on Isle Sainte Marie, Metarrhizium was associated with Cordyceps infestations. In a sodden, marshy rice field near Nosy Varika a moist decaying piece of Rapliia trunk 1-5 m. long, had galleries containing a pupa of Oryctes covered with Metarrhizium, another dead pupa without obvious Metarrhizium, two living pupae, a dead L3 and two living adults of 0. simiar. In the forest in the Montagne d'Ambre, of 252 Cetoniid larvae collected in decaying logs, only two cases of Metarrhizium were found.
The low incidence of manifestation of Metarrhizium infections under natural conditions in Madagascar is in agreement with the findings of Surany (1960) who reported that in a survey conducted in five countries of Asia less than 15 per cent, of 0. rhinoceros displayed visible signs of Metarrhizium infection, while in Africa less than 5 per cent, of the specimens of 0. monoceros (01.) and 0. boas (F.) were killed by Metarrhizium.
Parasites of the adults
Nematodes Some 90 per cent, of the males of 0. gigas examined had nematodes on and
between the membranes sheathing the aedeagus or in the aedeagus between the

parameres and in the fleshy ejaculatory duct itself (Table VI). They were also found in the aedeagus of specimens of 0. blucheaui, 0. simiar, 0. boas, 0. pyrrhus and 0. ranavalo, but were of less common occurrence in the last four species.
Some 90 per cent, of the females of 0. gigas dissected had nematodes in the

THE ECOLOGY OF ORYCTES IN MADAGASCAR

99

bursa copulatrix (Table VI). These nematodes resembled those found in the aedeagus of males. I t is possible that they are transmitted by the male to the females and that the nematodes may live at the expense of the spermatozoa. However, their presence in the bursa does not seem to affect the ripening of the eggs in the oviducts. For example, four females of 0. gigas (collected at Ankivanja on September 2, 1966) had totals of 19, 21 (2 specimens) and 22 large mature eggs in the ovaries, respectively, while the bursa in each was filled with a mass of these nematodes. In another female of 0. gigas the ovaries were not seen, being atrophied in this insect, which was perhaps very old, and in another specimen the ovaries were abnormal, being replaced by colourless or white spheres; in both these insects the proximal end of the bursa was filled with a mass of nematodes.
Nematodes also occurred in the bursae of females of 0. blucheaui, and of a small number of 0. simiar, but were not present in females of 0. boas, 0. pyrrhus or 0. ranavalo.
Small nematodes were found in the pair of small brown " colleterial " glands in the wall of the vagina, in 95 per cent, of females of 0. gigas examined (Table VI). They also occurred in all three specimens of 0. blucheaui examined, and were fairly common in 0. simiar, 0. •pyrrhus and 0. ranavalo. Nematodes were also found in the colleterial glands of one specimen of 0. rhinoceros collected in Mauritius.
About 50 per cent, of the 0. gigas of both sexes examined had tufts of small nematodes under the elytra at the wing bases (Table VI). These nematodes were also occasionally found on specimens of 0. blucheaui, 0. simiar, 0. boas, 0. pyrrhus and 0. ranavalo. They appeared merely to be using the insect as a means of transport.
C. P. Hoyt (Report on the investigations of predators and parasites of Oryctes in East Africa (1961-1962).—7 pp. South Pacific Commission) reported that 80 per cent, of the 0. monoceros specimens occurring along the coast of Kenya and Zanzibar had juvenile Cephalobid nematodes under the elytra and in the colleterial glands of females, and 90 per cent, had a species of Rhabditid nematode in the bursa copulatrix of females or in the aedeagus of males. The same author also reported (Eeport on the investigations of the factors affecting the populations of some dynastid beetles in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea (August 1962 to November 1962).—South Pacific Commission cyclostyled report) that in New Guinea, specimens of 0. centaurus Sternb. could have two species of Angiostomid nematodes in the preputial glands of the aedeagus of males, and in the bursa of females, and also another type of nematode, probably a Cephalobid, in the colleterial glands of females and in the sheath of the aedeagus of males.
Two cases of parasitism of adults by Mermithid nematodes were found. On November 29, 1966, dissection of an adult female, possibly of 0. ranavalo, taken at Diego Suarez in November 1966 revealed no nematodes under the elytra or in the bursa or colleterial glands, but a large specimen of a species of Mermis (Mermithoidea, Mermithidae) in the body tissue. The ovaries of this beetle contained a total of five large mature eggs. In the village of Ambia near Maroantsetra in December 1966, an adult male of 0. simiar was found with nine large Mermithid nematodes in the body tissue, and with some smaller nematodes in the aedeagus. The testes of this beetle were, nevertheless, quite well developed, one testis having six lobes, the other seven.

Mites Mites were commonly found on larvae and adults of Oryctes. On specimens
of 0. gigas, hundreds of large red mites belonging to the Mesostigmata, also

100

G. 0. BEDFORD

many smaller white mites, possibly Trombidiformes, occurred on the body and under the elytra on the wings. Mites were also found on the ventral surface of the body at the junction between the prothorax and the mesothorax. Though these different types of mites were often extremely numerous on the adults, the beetles did not appear to be adversely affected by them.

Predators of larvae
Elaterid larvae In some localities, Elaterid larvae were occasionally found associated with
larvae of Oryctes in breeding sites, but were not common and did not appear to be of great importance as predators of such larvae.
On a dry plain near Ambolobozokely a piece of dry rotten satra palm trunk about 4 m. long was found to contain two Oryctes L3, and a large Elaterid larva with a black head. One of the Oryctes larvae had 11 black marks on the body, apparently healed wounds.
In the coconut plantation at Ampanitoina a dead standing coconut palm 17 m. high with the top burnt, apparently as the result of lightning strike, had no hole in the top, but a brown Elaterid larva was present. Another dead palm, 18-5 m. high, had a central hole in the top containing moderately moist chewed fibre, in which was found an adult of 0. gigas and a brown Elaterid larva.
At Mangalimaso on Isle Sante Marie a rotten coconut stump full of old Oryctes galleries contained three LI, two L2 and eight L3 Oryctes and one small brown Elaterid larva.
A dead standing coconut palm at Fenerive had the top half rotten, with moist chewed fibre and tunnels, and contained seven L2 and six L3 Oryctes also one large brown Elaterid larva. At Vatomandry a dead standing coconut palm, 13 m. high, rotten at the top and with moist dark brown powder and old galleries contained one Oryctes LI and two large cream Elaterid larvae with black heads. Another dead standing palm 10 m. high was found with one large cream Elaterid larva, one Elaterid adult, and an Oryctes L3 head capsule in moist material under the bark at the top. Another small dead coconut palm contained in the moist fibrous rotting top seven small LI Oryctes, six white eggs, and six brown Elaterid larvae with dark brown heads.

Damage by Oryctes to coconut palms in the Comores
The Comores Archipelago comprises the four islands of Grande Comore, Moheli, Anjouan and Mayotte situated to the north-west of Madagascar in the Mozambique Channel.
Grande Comore This is the largest of the four islands in the Archipelago, and is dominated
by the large volcanic Massif du Kartala (2361 m.). There are many coconut palms growing densely along the western coast of
the island, and these are not seriously attacked by Oryctes. The author was informed that many coconut palms were thrown down by a cyclone in 1950 and there was subsequently an upsurge in the number of Oryctes breeding in the decaying trunks, but there has been little trouble with Oryctes since that time. Also the Comoriens burn much of the dead coconut wood to heat coral to make lime for building, thus keeping down the amount of breeding sites.
In the large plantation of very tall coconut palms at Salimani, the palms are moderately attacked by Oryctes and occasional dead standing palms are present. There is a fair amount of decaying wood present, and 40 dead coconut

THE ECOLOGY OF ORYCTES IN MADAGASCAR

101

palm trunks lying on the ground were examined in November. In one trunk there was a central tunnel 3 m. long filled with moist rotten powder, and containing one Ll, 20 L2 and 55 L3 Oryctes. Some 92 Oryctes larvae (mostly L3) were examined in this plantation: 86 appeared healthy and six were found dead in their galleries and covered with Metarrhizium. Of 22 dissected, some 15 contained nematodes in the fermentation chamber.
Some 24 adults of 0. insularis were collected in the decaying coconut trunks, and two males and two females were dissected. One of the males had nematodes within the aedeagus. One of the females had 19 large maturing eggs in the ovaries, also masses of large white active nematodes in the bursa, and nematodes in the colleterial glands. None had any nematodes at the bases of the elytra.
Moheli
There are many coconut palms in plantations on this island, but they do not seem to be heavily attacked by Oryctes.
Some 28 decaying coconut trunks were investigated in various parts of the island and 13 Ll, 35 L2, 207 L3, 10 pupae and 30 adults of O. insularis Coq. were collected. Some 63 L3 and five L2 were examined and all were of healthy appearance, none showing any sign of infection by Metarrhizium or parasitism by Scolia. None had any nematodes in the fermentation chamber.
Some of the adults died before dissection could be carried out. However, three females and one male were freshly killed. The male had no nematodes in the aedeagus, and of the three females, one had no nematodes, while two had nematodes in the bursa, but none in the colleterial glands.

Anjouan On this island there are many coconut palms. Some bore evidence of
moderate damage by Oryctes and had a few fronds cut, but the majority appeared to be quite healthy and not seriously damaged. Most of them, which grow quite densely in places, belong to the Comoriens, and are not planted in orderly rows. Not much decaying wood was seen. Coconut trunks, and a small number of rotting mango trunks, were examined in various parts of the island, and two Ll, 16 L2, 118 L3, three pupae and 16 O. insularis adults were collected. As on Grande Comore and Moheli, most of the larvae of Oryctes were in the L3 stage, probably soon to enter pupation. Some 110 Oryctes L3 were examined, and all were of healthy appearance; ten were dissected, but only one had nematodes in the fermentation chamber. About 16 adults of 0. insularis were dissected, and the results are presented in Table VII. One female had a total of 18 large eggs in the ovaries, and masses of large nematodes in the bursa; another had ten large eggs in the ovaries, and nematodes in the bursa. Two other females had the ovaries small and immature, and no nematodes in the bursa.

Mayotte
On this island most of the tall coconut palms occur in regular rows. In the large plantation of about 57,000 coconut palms at Kahani, nearly all the trees have one to three fronds attacked by Oryctes, but despite this the trees seem healthy and are not seriously damaged. Almost no dead standing palms are present in this plantation, and there is not a great deal of rotting wood.
Some five Ll, 31 L2, 48 L3, nine pupae and 25 adults of O. insularis were collected.
At Coconi one piece of decaying " jacquier " trunk (Artocarpus integer), 3-5 m. long, contained one L2 and seven L3 Oryctes in galleries, with frass

and chewed wood. A piece of decaying mango trunk contained two L3. A piece of decaying coconut trunk, 1 m. long, contained one pupa and nine adults of 0. insularis.
At Kahani plantation a piece of coconut trunk with the exterior decayed contained five L I , three L3 (of which two were prepupae), six pupae and ten adults of 0. insularis.
Some 48 Oryctes L3 were examined, and all were of healthy appearance; four were dissected, but none had any nematodes in the fermentation chamber.
Some 17 adults of Oryctes (16 0. insularis, one 0. simiar nesiotes Paulian male) were dissected and the results are presented in Table VII. Three of

the females had the ovaries small and undeveloped, and of these two had nematodes in the colleterial glands. One female had a total of 18 large eggs in the oviducts, another had 15 large eggs; both had some small nematodes in the colleterial glands but none in the bursa.
Development of the ovaries of 0. gigas
Discussions with agricultural extension officers and plantation managers indicate that on the north-west coast of Madagascar the heaviest attack by Oryctes occurs in the rainy season (November to April). This would indicate that the adults of Oryctes were most active during this period.
At Ankivanja, females of 0. gigas were collected and dissected in July, August and September and the results are given in Table VIII.

In July and August, in mid dry season, the females of 0. gigas found in the tops of dead standing coconut palms may have emerged only recently from metamorphosis and their ovaries would consequently be undeveloped. As the season progresses, more and more eggs would mature in the ovaries, ready for laying in the oncoming rainy season (November) as suggested by the trend in Table VIII, when females would fly to palm crowns to feed and to decaying logs to breed, with the resultant increase in activity during the rainy season already noted.

THE ECOLOGY OP ORYCTES IN MADAGASCAR

103

Discussion It was noted in Madagascar that tall, isolated, or otherwise conspicuous
coconut palms were often more severely attacked by Oryctes than shorter palms nearby. However, where only younger palms are available in an On/c£es-infested area, these too are liable to be attacked. Cumber (1957) commented on the ragged appearance of palms about villages in Western Samoa and noted the habit of beetles of congregating on isolated palms. He also noted that in plantations containing palms of two different ages, the older taller scattered palms are much more severely attacked than the younger ones beneath. Wood (1964) considers that beetles fly to the silhouette of a palm against the night sky, so that an exceptionally tall palm may be attacked while those of normal height in the stand around it are untouched.
The different species of Oryctes in Madagascar seem to have different behaviour patterns, for 0. pyrrhus will attack coconut seedlings and young oil palms by burrowing in the soil, whereas adults of 0. simiar were mostly found feeding in the hearts of established coconut palms.
The rarity of Oryctes in the forests of Madagascar may perhaps be due to the undergrowth obstructing the flight of the beetle. Both Cumber (1957) and Gressitt (1953) considered undergrowth to be important in restricting adult flight. Cumber concluded that the beetles seek unhampered flight conditions, so that beetles breeding away from plantations tend to gather and cause severe damage on the margins of the coconut plantations, and that beetles bred within plantations tend to fly towards margins or openings.
The occurrence of eggs, larvae (all stages) and adults of 0. gigas in the tops of dead standing coconut palms on the north-west coast of Madagascar (see Table II) is curious, and can be explained by assuming either that 0. gigas breeds all year round, or that some of the stages in the life cycle (for example, the third larval instar) undergo slow development over a prolonged period so that the whole life cycle occupies more than a year, and perhaps even two or three. Such slow development in 0. gigas might be geared to the marked wet and dry seasons prevailing in the area, and would be very different from that of 0. rhinoceros, which in Western Samoa occupies under favourable conditions approximately 130 days from oviposition to adult emergence (Hinckley, in press).
Oryctes gigas is a common pest of coconut palms in Senegal, the Congo Eepublic, Mozambique (Oberholzer, 1964), and on the north-west coast of Madagascar, where the southernmost records of its occurrence are given by Paulian (1959) as Soalala on the coast and near Maevatanana further inland. He considered this as evidence suggesting a relatively recent introduction of this species from Africa. The present author found specimens of 0. gigas at Morondava on the central west coast, about 450 km. to the south of Paulian's southernmost records. This species has never been reported from the east coast of Madagascar. In February 1967, Mr. P. Monsarrat of Centre O.E.S.T.O.M. (personal communication) found an adult of 0. gigas in a decaying trunk of Medemia near Hakaka in the Massif d'Isalo. This indicates that the species has spread well into the interior away from the coconut palms on the west coast, and is feeding on other palms. However, there are no Medemia or other palms between the Isalo and Ihosy on the edge of the Central Plateau and the climate becomes colder with increasing altitude, so it is doubtful whether 0. gigas will be able to spread overland further eastwards to reach the east coast.
The factors limiting populations of Oryctes in Madagascar are problematic. Scoliid cocoons were found in many widely separated localities, but they were never abundant in any particular locality. Lepointe (1960) also encountered Scoliids practically everywhere, but found that the percentage of larvae of Oryctes attacked was very small. Coquerel (1855), however, considered that

104

G. 0. BEDFOKD

Scolia oryctophaga Coquerel exerted a significant control over the populations of 0. simiar on Isle Sainte Marie. D'Emmerez de Charmoy (1923) and Simmonds (1941) collected Scoliid adults from flowers around Tamatave and on Isle Sainte Marie, but gave no information on the degree of parasitism of local populations of Oryctes.
The gregarine disease was found in several localities, but affected only a very small number of larvae. As far as fungal parasitism is concerned, cases of Metarrhizium were rare, while Cordyceps was found in only one locality.
No insect parasites of the adult stage of Oryctes were found. It would seem that the major factor limiting populations of Oryctes in Madagascar is the number of suitable breeding sites available. In localities such as Ankivanja, where the amount of coconut wood or other rotten wood in a suitable state of decay is small, the population of Oryctes is restricted, whereas in areas such as Mahilaka, where material suitable for breeding is abundant, more Oryctes may develop.
The problem of Oryctes incidence in the Comores Archipelago is interesting, as there are very many coconut palms of medium to tall height present, and Oryctes larvae and adults of Oryctes are readily found in decaying trunks, yet the coconut palms in general do not appear to be heavily attacked or destroyed by these beetles. Here again the restricted number of available breeding sites appears to be the factor limiting population growth.
Summary
In a study of the incidence of damage to coconut palms in Madagascar and the Comores Archipelago caused by species of Oryctes (Scarabaeidae) it was found that attack is heaviest in localities where there are abundant breeding sites for the beetle, and that tall palms are more often attacked than short ones. The most important larval breeding sites are dead standing coconut palms and decaying coconut trunks and stumps. Larvae also breed in decaying satra trunks (Medemia sp.), wood of Albizia in coffee plantations, decaying Raphia trunks, and occasionally in rubbish heaps and manure, but are only rarely encountered in decaying wood in forests. Coconut palms are important feeding sites for 0. ffigas, 0. blucheaui and 0. simiar. 0. pyrrhus attacks coconut seedlings and young oil palms. Forest palms are occasionally attacked. 0. ranavalo attacks bamboo on the east coast. Banana plants are occasionally attacked by 0. simiar.
Scoliid parasites of the larvae of Oryctes are widely distributed but not commonly found. Gregarines in larvae are also widespread but of rare occurrence. Oxyurid nematodes were often found in the fermentation chamber at the gut of Oryctes and Cetonid larvae. The fungus Cordyceps sp. was found at only one locality where it was attacking 56 per cent, of the larvae of Oryctes. Examples of infection by the fungus Metarrhizium were rarely encountered. Nematodes often occurred in the aedeagus of adult males of 0. gigas and in the bursa copulatrix and colleterial glands of adult females, as well as under the elytra. They were less common in the other species of Oryctes examined. Mermithid nematodes were found in adults of Oryctes on rare occasions. No insect parasites of the adult stage of Oryctes were found. Elaterid larvae, possibly predacious on those of Oryctes were occasionally found but did not appear to be of much importance.
It is concluded that the major factor limiting Oryctes populations in Madagascar and the Comores is the number of suitable breeding sites.
