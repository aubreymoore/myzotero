On three islands of the Seychelles archipelago, the baculovirus of Oryctes rhinoceros was introduced into populations of 0vcte.s monoceros and became established. The percentage of infected
beetles fluctuated between 20 and 50 and a modest population reduction (ca. 30%) was recorded. On a separate group of islands (Praslin group) the virus was found to have survived from a pre-

vious release made in 1973: on these islands the rate of infection was between 70 and 90%. j IYX~

INTRODUCTION
Beetles of the genus Ouyctes are pests of palms in most of the Old World tropics, particularly affecting seedling coconut and oil palms. The main economic species in Asia is Oryctes rhinoceros; this species has a high fecundity for the genus (Hurpin and Fresneau, 1973) and has been able to colonize many Pacific and some Indian Ocean islands (Bedford, 1980). In Africa, a complex of species is involved, of which Oryctes monoceros is the most important (Mariau, 1967); in the Seychelles islands, 0. monoceros is the only species present.
Among many control agents tested against Oryctes, one which has proved effective is a baculovirus (Baculoviridae, subgroup “C,” Matthews, 1979) isolated in Malaysia from 0. rhinoceros by Huger (1966). This virus was characterized by Payne (1974) and Payne et al. (1977) and Monsarrat et al. (1973). In the Ivory Coast it was found not to affect 0. monoceros (see Julia and Mariau, 1976), but in Seychelles the same species was susceptible (Windsor, 1975).
Virus was originally introduced into Seychelles in 1973 because the 0. monoceros population was very high, particularly on the islands of Praslin and La Digue, where attacks by the wood-boring lymexylonid,

Melittomma irzsulare, had killed many trees. Releases were made on Mahe, Praslin, and La Digue, using artificial breeding sites following the methods used in Mauritius (Monty, 1978). In 1975 a few remnants of dead larvae found on Praslin were sent to the Institute of Virology, Oxford, England, where the presence of virus was confirmed serologically. No infection was found on MahC or La Digue at that time, or during subsequent surveys on Praslin. The confirmed sample of virus was regarded as doubtful because of subsequent problems with the antiserum used reacting with healthy insect protein (I. A. D. Robertson. unpubl.).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Insects. Live adult beetles were collected from coconut plantations by employing ethyl chrysanthemumate (Stauffer Chemicals, New Jersey) traps (Bedford, 1973), from their feeding burrows in the crowns of seedling coconut palms. and from dead coconut palm logs. The latter also provided all the larval stages. Adult beetles were immediately placed into individual clean glass tubes. Larvae were collected in nylon bags, all the larvae from one log being placed in one bag.
In the laboratory, adult beetles were kept

in plastic beakers until they died, at which time they were processed or frozen intact at -20°C. Larvae were maintained in a
mixture of manure and sawdust in individual containers.
The identification of the beetle was confirmed as 0. monoceros by Dr. R. Madge of the Commonwealth Institute of Entomology, with the reservation that there
were consistent differences between 0. monoceros in the Seychelles and East Africa. The Seychelles beetle is larger and its pronotal cavity is less strongly punctate.
Virus. The midgut was dissected out of the dead (frozen or fresh) beetle and homogenized in 1 ml of cold distilled water.
The homogenate was assayed for presence of virus by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique or by crossover electrophoresis (or else was frozen at - 20°C).
Serological assay. Antiserum was produced in rabbits by intramuscular injection
of purified virus particles plus Freund’s adjuvant and was supplied by the Institute of Virology, Oxford, England. Two injections had been given, at weekly intervals, and serum was collected at weekly intervals up
to week 4 (Payne et al., 1977). In the ELISA test, the double antibody
method of Clark and Adams (1977) was used; polystyrene plates (Titertek Ltd.) were sensitized by coating with immunoglobulin G (IgG) diluted l/100 in Na,CO, buffer, pH 9.6. IgG was prepared from serum by precipitation with an equal volume of saturated ammonium sulfate solution. Midgut macerate diluted l/10 and l/100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was applied, followed by conjugate at a dilution of l/400. The conjugate was prepared by coupling IgG with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) in the presence of 0.06% glutaraldehyde. The substrate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma), at a concentration of 0.67 mg/ml in diethanolamine buffer (9.7% v/v, pH 9.8), was incubated in the wells for 1 hr at 37°C. All other steps were incubated overnight at 4”C, and between each step

the wells were washed with PBS-Tween.

The absorption at 405 nm was measured

manually in a Pye-Unicam SP6 spectropho-

tometer.

Cross-over electrophoresis was carried

out on Cellogel strips at 120 V for 30 min

with equipment supplied by Whatman-

BDH Ltd. Ten microliters of the midgut

macerate was applied to the cathodic side,

and 1 ~1 of neat antiserum on the anodic

side. Following two washes in 0.85% w/v

saline, the Cellogel strips were stained in

0.5% w/v Napthalene Black (Acid Black 2,

Whatman-BDH)

in methanol:acetic

acid:water (45: 10:45) and destained in

methanol:acetic acid:water (47.5:5:47.5).

Extracts from virus-infected beetles gave a

distinct blue line.

Larval extracts could not be assayed by

either of the above methods nor by Ouch-

terlony double immunodiffusion

tests,

probably owing to oxidation of the ex-

tracts. In the absence of any more definite

criteria, a flaccid cadaver was considered

as virus infected. Fungal infections resulted

in a stiff cadaver; this simple distinction

was confirmed by bioassay of larval ex-

tracts in adult beetles.

Infection with virus. Virus was obtained

from live infected male 0. rhinoceros from

the Philippines and from field-collected

beetles from Praslin Island. Inoculum for

the 1973 release had been sent as frozen 0.

rhinoceros larvae from Samoa.

The inoculum used for infection of adult

beetles was a midgut macerate prepared

and assayed as described above. Fifty mi-

croliters of each of two virus-positive ex-

tracts were diluted l/10 in 10% sucrose so-

lution. Ten microliters of this mixture was

applied to the beetles’ mouthparts.

Larvae were infected by mixing virus-in-

fected adult midgut or larval extract with

their food.

Estimation of population density. The

density of the beetle population was as-

sessed by palm damage surveys (Bedford, 1976; Hammes, 1974). Although this

method is good for comparisons, there are

many assumptions involved in calculating the actual beetle population. The method was therefore “calibrated” by making an absolute estimate of the beetle population of a small island by the mark-release-recapture method or Lincoln Index (Southwood, 1978). Ethyl chrysanthemumate traps were used to capture the beetles, which were marked before release by tiling a groove across the elytron with a scalpel. Experiments had shown this to have no effect on the beetles’ longevity. The proportion of marked to unmarked beetles recaptured is assumed to be the same as the pro-

portion of captured beetles in the whole population.
The damage to palms was assessed from a sample of 40 palms in each of four ecological zones. The density of palms was also estimated, and the area of each zone measured from the Department of Overseas Survey (1: 10,000) map (Table 2).
Virus release and monitoring of results. For field releases of virus, beetles reared from larvae in the laboratory were infected as described above. Some were retained in the laboratory to determine whether infection had been successful. The remainder

were placed in an open wooden box containing moist sawdust; this was suspended above the ground to avoid predation by rats. Most beetles dispersed from the boxes within 3 days.
Samples of the beetle population collected from coconut plantations as described above were assayed for presence of virus for several months before the initial virus release began and continuously thereafter. Trap sites and collecting areas are shown in Figure 1.
RESULTS
The susceptibility of 0. monoceros to the baculovirus of 0. rhinoceros was confirmed in the laboratory before release took place. However, the findings are not presented, as under local conditions the determination of LD,,s was not possible, virus could not be purified and, owing to interference from insect proteins, ELISA tests did not give quantitative results.
In a crude bioassay, the virus from Praslin compared favorably with the strains from Philippines and Samoa, so this local strain was selected for field release; it was considered preferable to utilize virus from 0. monoceros than to introduce an exotic virus strain.
Beetles from various islands in the Sey-

chelles were checked for virus infection
(Table 1). On MahC and the outlying coralline islands, the beetle populations were free of virus, but on the Praslin group the beetles were infected, often at very high infection rates.
The results of damage surveys on Ste. Anne island are shown in Table 2, with a population estimate by the Lincoln Index.
This allows the damage survey to be calibrated so that population estimates can be inferred on other islands.
Table 3 shows both the total number and proportion of infected beetles released. For Mahe, a figure for the population in the Barbarons area is also given as this is where releases took place. It is unlikely
that any of the released beetles would have dispersed beyond this area, as the flight activity of infected beetles is reduced (Zelazny, 1976).
The results of monitoring by ethyl chrysanthemumate traps are shown in Figure 2 (Ste. Anne) and Figure 3 (Mahe, Barbarons). On Ste. Anne, the virus was first detected about 10 weeks after release of virus-infected beetles. The overall infection rate was 34.8% & 6 (N = 273); the fluctuations in the recorded infection rate were not statistically different from this. On Mahe, the virus took 16 weeks to become established and 10 months to reach a 30%

infection rate. The overall rate was 30.6% + 4 (N = 800) which was not significantly different from the rate on Ste. Anne.
The spread of the virus to the southeast was monitored using the traps at Anse-auxPins (Fig. 1) on the opposite coast of MahC from the release site. The spread southwards was monitored by collections from dead logs and palm crowns (Table 4), and these data have been used to calculate a gradient of dispersal (Fig. 4). Following logarithmic transformation of both percent infection and distance in meters the slope of this line was b = -0.35 initially, and

progressed to a two-component form. The factor b is similar to that computed for the spread of baculovirus in 0. rhinoceros in
Tongatapu (Entwistle et al., 1983). The rate of spread of virus disease in Seychelles was
1.5 km/month measured from the time of virus release, and 4 km/month from the es-
tablishment of the epizootic at the release site.
No trends in the number of beetles trapped are apparent in Figures 2 and 3. However, a reduction in damage of 35% was recorded by the method of Hammes (1974) (Table 5).

On Praslin, the rate of infection of adult beetles was monitored for 6 months (October, 1982-March, 1983). The overall rate of infection was 76.4% t 7 (N = 123), significantly higher than the infection rates on Ste. Anne and MahC.
DISCUSSION
All previous epizootiological studies of B. oryctes have been concerned with 0. rhinoceros (Bedford, 1982). In those areas where the beetle had become established, introduction of the virus rapidly caused a reduction in population, e.g., Mauritius (Monty, 1978), Fiji (Bedford, 1976), and Wallis (Hames, 1971). In areas where the beetle is endemic, populations were lower where the virus was present than where it was absent (Zelazny, 1977). Thus, the virus is a significant mortality factor for 0. rhiIIOCCYOS,although the beetle can still cause problems when breeding sites are abundant. The possible advantages of rerelease of virus into 0. rhinoceros populations are discussed by Marschall and Ioane (1982).

0. monoceros has been present in Seychelles since records began, and has at-
tained population levels high enough to kill mature palms (Lionnet, 1971). At the start of the present work there were only modest
populations and damage levels were commensurately low. Presumably, had the initial beetle populations been higher, a greater percentage reduction would have been achieved.
When virus is introduced to a population, it eventually either disappears or be-
comes established. Once the percentage of infected hosts rises above a certain level. the population declines to a greater or lesser extent, until the virus incidence also declines. They may lead to fluctuations in the host insect population with concurrent variations in virus incidence, or to an equilibrium between insect and virus. The baculovirus became established on Mahe and Ste. Anne with little fluctuation; it took longer to establish in 0. monoceros in Seychelles than in 0. rhinoceros in Papua New Guinea (Gorrick, 1980). The equilibrium in-

fection rate was similar for Seychelles 0. monoceros to that observed for 0. rhinoceros in Philippines and in Samoa (Zelazny,
1977; Marschall and Ioane, 1982). The rate of dispersal was also similar to that observed for 0. rhinoceros in Tonga (Young, 1974).
The apparent discrepancy between popu-
lations of adult beetles as estimated from the catch in ethyl chrysanthemumate traps and as estimated from palm damage, has also been reported for 0. rhinoceros in
Western Samoa (Marschall and Ioane, 1982). Both approaches provide only indirect estimates; in theory the traps measure density compounded with flight activity (it is not known whether ethyl chrysanthemumate simulates a feeding or a mating attractant but see Sabatini, 1979), and palm
damage measures density compounded with feeding activity. Trap catches show more variation than damage throughout the year. From observation on the abundance of the larval instars, it does not appear that
the population varies greatly throughout the year. Therefore, feeding damage is considered to be the more reliable estimate of adult numbers. It is possible that flight activity increases to compensate for falling populations in order for breeding contacts to be maintained. In contrast to 0. rhinoceros, adult activity in 0. monoceros has a tendency to increase with higher rainfall. In common with 0. rhinoceros, there was a tendency for the proportion of females

trapped to rise as the rate of infection in the population increased.
The high infection rate on Praslin Island is in contrast to that observed on the other islands, and those for 0. rhinoceros [apart from a report of 84% infection in Tonga using ELISA (Young and Longworth, 198 1)I. The possibility of resistance or tolerance of the beetle, and of attenuation of the virus, are at present under investigation. The answer may lie in ecological or climatic differences between Mah6 and Praslin: alternatively, the island of Praslin may be small enough for local extinction of virus to occur, leading to fluctuations in the infection rate. The relationship between numbers of infected beetles and population reduction needs to be determined. This should enable accurate control recommendations to be made, and the value of integrated control measures to be estimated.
