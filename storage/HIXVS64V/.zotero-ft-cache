The ants collected in Guam by D. T. Fullaway in 1911 were identified by W. M. \Vheeler and published in the Journal of the New York Entomological Society (20: 44-48, 1912). There were 21 forms listed. Some of the records were on single specimens, and a few others were recorded on a meager amount of material.
Our collections made in 1936 included all but two of the forms listed by \iVheeler, most of them in quite large quantities. We also collected 10 species not previously recorded. Only a single specimen of Strmnigenys godeffroyi was found, and of a few others, only about a dozen specimens were obtained, collected in only one or two localities. For the majority, however, much material was collected from numerous localities, indicating that these species were widely distributed to all parts of the island.
Several of the species collected in houses were troublesome pests. Of the six species, three of them were numerous: Anoplolepis longipes, a longlegged yellow ant which was continually racing around the floors; M onomorium pha.raonis, a tiny yellow ant; M onomorium floricola, a tiny black ant which was a nuisance with insect vials and tins, often getting in and destroying living material. Nine species were obtained one afternoon in a garden, and at one time, six species were obtained from bamboo stumps. Five species were usually to be found in cane fields; two of them (Solenopsis geminata rufa and Tetramorium guineense) were associated with an aleurodid and mealybugs.
Nine of the species, or nearly half, occur in the Hawaiian islands (mavked with an asterisk). The others are mostly species which are widely distributed among the islands of the Pacific and the Philippines, even extending to India. Although fewer species of ants were found in Guam than those recorded for Hawaii, ants seemed much more numerous in Guam because of the abundance of several of the species. Being chiefly insect feeders, they must take an enormous toll of the usual insect life and be an important factor in checking some of the pests.

It is a large black species with long mandibles. One winged male was collected in house, but we collected most of the others among leaves and trash on the ground in the forest areas. Once a colony was found at the base of a rotten banana stem.

India. It was collected in Guam by Fullaway in 1911, and is one of the very abundant species. It was collected practically everywhere, and in many situations: in cane fields, often nesting in rotten cane, often associated with mealybugs; in the house, the garden, and lawn; nesting under bark of Pithecolobium, in dead branch of breadfruit and orange, in rotten bamboo stumps; on corn, cacao, and pumpkin vines. In one nest among bases of coconut leaf stems were the small yellow lepismicls which are inhabitants of ant nests.

This lively, long-legged, yellowish ant is distributed throughout the Pacific islands, Papua, Indomalaya, Reunion, Ceylon, India, and Burma. It was collected in Guam by Fullaway in 1911. We collected it practically everywhere we went in Guam in 1936, and in many kinds of situations. Nests were in rotten logs, under stones, and one populous nest was in the dead frond of the giant fern (Angiopteris eveeta). They were lively on garden plants and shrubpery, and could be swept from most plants in the forests. They were always running on the floor of our residence and in corners, and any insect dropped on the floor would soon be found and dragged off. The female is brown and many times larger than the worker. The male is a little larger than the worker and of the same color.
