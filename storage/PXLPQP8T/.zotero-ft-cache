The Guam Invasive Species Council on Friday hosted a proclamation-signing at Adelup, recognizing Feb. 26 to March 2 as Guam Invasive Species Awareness Week.

"Many of our farmers and agricultural professionals know it's hard to raise produce...with as many invasive species that we have," Lt. Gov. Ray Tenorio said.

Among the invasive species on Guam, the coconut rhinoceros beetle is most important to him, he said, because of it's adverse impact on Guam's coconut trees, an iconic symbol represented in the middle of the Guam flag, Tenorio said.

Tenorio said he is open to recommendations for improving the system of detection of invasive species to help preserve the island's resources and our way of life. 

"We have our grandkids and future generations to look out for," Tenorio said. 

Glenn Dulla, agriculturalist with the Department of Agriculture Security, said he deals with invasive species that are established on island, such as the rhino beetle, fire ants, and the greater banded hornet. 

According to Dulla, money, resources, and manpower are invested in protecting our borders from invasive species, however, "There's always something that sneaks in." 

Dulla said, we have to invest in more resources to prevent invasive species from coming in, "To prevent them from leaving our island and infecting other islands." 

Dulla said, for this month, they want to focus on outreach and awareness of invasive species on island. 

"We want the community to be proactive in learning about species that are here on the island ... what species don't belong here on the island, and how they can destroy our ecosystem," Dulla said. 

Once the community understands the impact of invasive species, then we can all work together to combat them, Dulla said. 

"Only as a full and complete unit do we make a true impact," Dulla said. 

Aubrey Moore, an entomologist at the University of Guam ,said, "When it comes to invasive species ... we don't really know,"

According to Moore, because Guam does not have a biodiversity inventory—a list of organisms that occur here — the total number of invasive species on island is unclear. 

Moore said he has a list of about 300 agricultural pests, and about 95 percent of those pests are invasive species. 

"What we need to do is put together a checklist of the organisms on Guam," Moore said. 

According to Moore, most ornamental plants brought to Guam carry insects and diseases, "We can't keep everything out," 

More said a process called biological control helps to reduce invasive species that establish themselves on island. 

The process starts by identifying the invasive species and finding it's natural predator, which is released to reduce the population, Moore said. 

"It's an equilibrium ... we're trying to restore the balance of nature," Moore said.

"That's the best way of handling these invasive species once they are established," Moore said. "Once invasive species are established, chances of eradication are very rare.
Brown Tree Snake 

According to Jane Dia, with the Division of Aquatic and Wildlife Resources at the Guam Department of Agriculture, the brown tree snake population is estimated to be 1 to 2 million, "That's more than people on Guam," she said.

"The brown tree snake control our agency does is to benefit placing native birds in a habitat that's snake suppressed," Dia said. 

Dia also is a program coordinator for Kontra I Kulepbla, which  is a brown tree snake awareness program in support of native bird recovery.

Dia highlighted a project on Cocos island, that controlled the population of brown tree snake. As a result, the Ko'ko' bird population there increased from 16 to almost 70. 

The brown tree snake drove the native birds from the south to northern Guam, where they were last seen, Dia said. 

"In order for us to bring back our native habitat...we really still need to suppress the numbers of brown tree snakes," Dia said. "We don't want people to forget our native birds."
