CHAPTER 1

“Small is the voice of the chief, for gentleness and courtesy should walk hand in hand with power”
Aleki Sisifa devoted his working life to strengthening food security in the Pacific region and to improving the lot of the smallholder farmers who underpin it. He was a natural leader, with an uncanny ability to unite disparate team members from all disciplines and walks of life, finding consensus and delivering optimum development outcomes for the region. A true Pacific Chief and mentor to so many, he will not be forgotten.

Foreword
Pacific Island countries and territories already face a range of development challenges due to their specific geographic and socio-economic characteristics, and their generally high exposure to natural hazards. The projected changes to the climate of the Pacific Island region over the coming decades present another challenging dimension that the region will need to grapple with. These changes could compromise the very ability of Pacific communities to meet their economic development needs.
Agriculture and forestry underpin the livelihoods of a large number of people across the region and also account for a significant share of export income for most countries. It is vital that we understand how climate change will affect these sectors and what we can do to manage these emerging impacts. The devastation to Vanuatu’s crops and economic infrastructure caused by tropical cyclone Pam in March 2015 clearly demonstrates the potential consequences of the increased intensity of extreme weather events that will accompany climate change. It is essential that we identify measures to limit the impact of such events and ensure that food security and livelihoods are maintained.
It gives me pleasure to introduce this book, which provides the most comprehensive and up-to-date assessment of the potential impact of climate change on Pacific agriculture and forestry yet produced. To date, our understanding of the likely impacts of climate change on Pacific agriculture and forests has been somewhat limited and piecemeal, and projected impacts have often been based on extrapolations from research undertaken elsewhere by the international scientific community. It is therefore important that we shed more light on specific issues for the Pacific and better understand the implications for food security and island economies.
This publication, which is the second in a series of climate impact assessments for specific sectors completed by the Pacific Community, follows the 2011 publication, Vulnerability of Tropical Pacific Fisheries and Aquaculture to Climate Change. Similar to the findings of the 2011 fisheries vulnerability assessment, it is evident that climate change will, overall, have a negative impact on the productivity of the agriculture and forestry sectors across the Pacific over the coming decades. However, this research also highlights the underlying resilience of Pacific agriculture to climate change, particularly for many of the region’s staple food crops, and the fact that we have some breathing space to enable us to put in place appropriate response measures to accommodate the expected changes and capitalise on any positive opportunities that may emerge. There are both potential winners and losers across the sectors.
This book identifies a range of potential response measures that could be implemented to significantly reduce exposure to climate related risks and enable the Pacific Community to better cope with emerging impacts. Many of these measures would contribute to improving agricultural productivity and livelihood resilience
VII

with or without climate change, but others would entail additional investment and changes to production systems. This work represents a major step forward in progressing our understanding of climate change impacts on Pacific agriculture and forestry. However, in producing this publication it became evident that significant knowledge gaps still remain, especially in regard to Pacific staple and cash crops. It is important that we put in place suitable research strategies to address these gaps over the coming years, particularly through applied research and assessments at the country level, where decisions about appropriate adaptation investments are being made. I extend my thanks to the many authors and experts who contributed to this publication, above all the principal editors, Mary Taylor, Andrew McGregor and Brian Dawson. In particular, I acknowledge the Australian Government, which provided the funding support that made this book possible. I trust this work will provide a valuable resource for decision-makers who can help guide and prioritise potential response options, especially in terms of the importance and timing of investment for adaptation measures.

Introduction
The agriculture and forestry sectors are of vital socio-economic importance to Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs). These sectors underpin the livelihoods of a significant proportion of the region’s population and also account for an important share of export earnings for many countries. It is essential therefore to assess the potential impacts of climate change on the agriculture and forestry sectors, what this may mean for livelihoods across the region, and what can be done to minimise emerging adverse impacts.
PICTs already face a range of challenges in terms of maintaining adequate food security and sustaining commodity export income. Continued population growth, urbanisation, low or stagnant agricultural production and yields, environmental degradation and price competition from imported food products are all risks to food security. The region also faces intense competition in international markets for the exports it produces, and income from most of these products has been relatively flat or falling for some time. Increasing the productivity, competitiveness and sustainability of agricultural production, and ensuring ongoing food and livelihood security in the coming decades, remains an important challenge for the region irrespective of climate change, and this must be kept in mind when assessing future impacts and response capabilities. Chapter 1 sets the scene for this book by providing an overall assessment of the importance of agriculture across the different PICTs and discusses some of the key challenges currently faced by the sector.
Climate change is likely to present an additional set of challenges for the agriculture and forestry sectors, particularly in terms of managing the projected increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The region has always been highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability and extreme weather, such as floods, intense rain, droughts and cyclones and these have been the cause of significant production losses to the agriculture and forestry sectors in the past. While farmers, foresters and tree growers have developed agricultural and forestry systems that help minimise climate related risks, the magnitude of potential changes to key climatic variables projected for this century is likely to present a more formidable adaptation challenge.
Recent international research on the potential impacts of climate change on agricultural production suggests that warming of even 1.5–2 C 0 will adversely impact on global food production, especially for the world’s major staple food crops such as wheat, maize and rice. It is a widely held view that agricultural commodity and food production in the Pacific will face similar impacts. However, in producing this publication it was evident that the body of research that specifically targets the impacts of climate change on Pacific agriculture is generally sparse and piecemeal. Only limited applied climate change impact research on agriculture has been
1

undertaken in the region and, as a result, many gaps in the knowledge base relevant to the food production systems across the Pacific remain. Of those assessments that do exist, many have often been based on extrapolations from international research undertaken elsewhere. If farmers, scientists and policy makers are to make informed decisions on whether or not response options are needed, and when they may be needed, it is essential that our understanding of the Pacific context be improved.
This book aims to improve our understanding of climate change impacts on Pacific crops, livestock and forest production systems. Where information gaps exist the authors have drawn on expert opinion across the region and international research institutions. This has provided valuable insights into the vulnerability of particular agriculture and forestry production systems under projected changes to the region’s climate. This book identifies and highlights these gaps and may guide the type of future research and assessment that needs to be undertaken in the coming years.
Identifying the likely changes to key climatic variables is crucial to the impact assessment process. Chapter 2 provides an overview of our current understanding about how the region’s climate could change over time. It uses the most up-to-date climate change information available for the region, drawing heavily on the significant research work undertaken in recent years through the Pacific Climate Change Science Program, IPCC and other research efforts. Chapter 3 provides a summary overview of the broader implications of climate change across the agriculture sector and what are likely to be the key drivers for change, and where impacts can be expected to occur.
Each of the following five chapters discusses the optimum bioclimatic conditions for growth and productivity for specific crops and forest types, assesses the observed climate impacts over the past 30 years, then considers vulnerability to projected climate conditions under different emission scenarios and timelines. Chapter 4 discusses the potential implications for Pacific staple crops that are important for food security and underpin the livelihoods of a large number of people across the region. Chapter 5 specifically addresses the potential impacts on the region’s major export commodities such as coffee, sugar, copra, palm oil and cocoa and identifies potential risks and opportunities. In particular, it highlights the high level of vulnerability of coffee production to even small changes in climate and the potentially significant impacts the projected changes may have on PNG, a major coffee producing country. Chapter 6 reviews the potential impacts on the horticultural industry, an important commercial activity in a number of countries, while Chapter 7 addresses potential climate change related impacts on the region’s livestock production systems. Chapter 8 is devoted to the forestry sector and assesses what climate change could mean for the productivity of Pacific forestry, agroforestry and the vulnerability of specific forest ecosystems.
2

Finally, Chapter 9 draws on the results and conclusions of Chapters 3 to 8 and assesses the overall implications of climate change on the contribution of agriculture and forestry to Pacific Island economies and communities.
As this publication clearly demonstrates, the Pacific agriculture and forestry sectors are vulnerable to changes in the region’s climate. Although the magnitude and extent of these changes will be influenced by the success of efforts to limit future greenhouse gas emissions it is evident that the climate will continue to change for many decades to come even if substantial reductions in emissions can be achieved in the near future. The region will need to respond to these changes and put in place measures to limit climate risk and maximise opportunities. The important question is what should be done and when.
The traditional crops and production systems are, in general, relatively resilient to variations in climatic conditions. However, many traditional farming practices have declined in recent years, often in response to commercial production needs. As a result it is likely that the vulnerability of Pacific food and commodity production systems to climate variability has increased in the past two decades. Irrespective of what climate change eventuates there is a clear need to address this increased level of vulnerability and put in place measures that improve the resilience of production systems and management regimes. Measures that address existing vulnerability, while also building resilience to future climate change, are generally referred to as ‘no regret’ measures; in other words actions that make sense even in the absence of climate change. Throughout this book the authors have identified a range of measures that could be viewed as ‘no regret’ actions and these should be the primary focus of climate change adaptation in the short to medium term (up to 2030).
As with agriculture, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to future impacts of climate change on Pacific Island forests and trees. Therefore, implementation of ‘no regret’ actions has to be the way forward, with the emphasis on the roles of good forestry management and agroforestry practices as a way of building resilience to all forms of environmental change, economic change, invasive species and humaninduced climate change.
The full impacts of climate change are relatively slow to emerge but it is likely that more substantive adjustments and adaptation investments may be needed over time. For decision-makers to make informed judgements about what adaptation response measures should be implemented they need appropriate information on what is likely to occur and when. They also need reliable information on the outcomes of existing adaptation response measures, what potential measures exist and what such measures would cost. It is important that we have good understanding of the social and economic trade-offs associated with implementing different response measures. Given the limited resources available to farmers and other actors in the agricultural
3

and forestry sectors it is essential that investment decisions be based on actual identified needs and informed cost–benefit analysis. The time dimension is also critical to the decision-making process as some changes will occur in the short to medium term while others are much longer term in nature. Throughout the various chapters the authors have aimed to provide insights to the timing of potential impacts and, when appropriate, potential response measures that could be implemented. While it is important to understand what impacts may emerge over the longer term it makes no sense, either economically or socially, to devote substantial resources to adaptation investments to respond to climate change impacts that may occur 30–50 years from now. Chapter 10, the final chapter in this book, addresses many of these issues and discusses adaptive capacity, the timing and importance of potential adaptation response measures and a range of other important issues that policy makers and providers of development assistance need to be aware of. The chapter identifies a wide range of potentially viable adaptation measures that exist and the relative importance of the different adaptation response measures. It uses the findings of the preceding chapters to draw a range of conclusions and recommendations relating to the projected impact of climate change on Pacific agriculture and forestry, and what can be done to reduce the risks posed by these projected changes. It also highlights areas where more applied research and assessment are required to improve the quantity and reliability of information flows to policy and investment decision-makers. Although uncertainty and knowledge gaps around specific climate change impacts on Pacific agriculture and forestry remain, this book is an important step towards building a better understanding of potential impacts and their timing. As a result it is a useful resource for policy decision-makers, the donor community and the general public.

CHAPTER 1
1.1 Introduction
As discussed in the introduction, the agriculture sector is of vital importance to the Pacific region. Agricultural products are a significant component of exports for many countries in the region and food production activities (agriculture and fishing) continue to employ the greatest percentage of the labour force, either in commercial enterprises, or more commonly, in self-sufficiency endeavours. This is despite the Pacific region comprising the most environmentally vulnerable nations in the world. Natural disasters, such as cyclones, floods and droughts are not new to the region. However, the climate projections for the 21st century and beyond, (discussed in Chapter 2), suggest that extreme events such as heatwaves, droughts and floods are likely to increase in frequency and intensity, projected rainfall and rainfall patterns are likely to create problems for a region already affected by droughts and floods, and cyclones are most likely to increase in intensity. Extreme high tides and storm surges will probably continue to threaten low-lying islands, as will the ongoing sea level rise, which will cause contamination of groundwater.
Jon Barnett (2011) summed up the potential impact of climate change in the region: ‘Climate change will adversely affect food systems in the region, including the supply of food from agriculture and fisheries, the ability of countries to import food, systems for the distribution of food, and the ability of households to purchase and utilize food. In these ways, climate change puts at risk the very basic and universal need for people in the islands to have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food at all times’ (p.1)
It is vital therefore that the Pacific region assesses the vulnerability of its agriculture sector, so that strategies can be developed both to cope with extreme climate events and improve the resilience of production systems to the changing climate.
This chapter sets the scene for this publication. It outlines the approach used for assessing the vulnerability of the agriculture and forestry1 sectors and considers the assets2 available within the region that can influence the adaptive capacity of communities (Adger et al. 2004). The chapter also discusses the importance of agriculture, and existing constraints to agricultural productivity, such as declining soil fertility and future challenges with regards to food supply and food security, such as increasing population and urbanisation, all of which need to be taken into account in any analysis of the sector.

1.2 Assessing the vulnerability of the agriculture and forestry sectors to climate change
1.2.1 Defining vulnerability
Agriculture and forestry systems are vulnerable to climate variability, whether it is part of a natural pattern or caused by human activities. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) definition for vulnerability (V) is ‘vulnerability is a function of character, magnitude, rate of climate variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity and its adaptive capacity’ (IPCC, 2001). V = E x S/A is generally accepted as an interpretation of the definition. Assessing the vulnerability of a system requires analysis of the exposure and sensitivity to climate variation and change, and the adaptive capacity of the system to cope with the variation. The term ‘system’ includes species, ecosystem and society (Figure 1.1).

Figure 1.1 Framework used for assessing vulnerability (source: Bell et al. 2011).
Exposure (E) is considered as the nature and degree to which a system is subjected to significant climate variations (IPCC, 2001). These variations, which can be direct or indirect, include long-term, slow onset changes such as increases in mean annual temperature and also variations to natural extremes that exceed known stress thresholds, that is, extreme events. An example of a direct effect of climate change on livestock would be productivity losses resulting from physiological stress caused by temperature increases; an indirect effect would be a change in the availability and/or quality of the fodder affecting the productivity of the livestock.
Sensitivity (S) is the degree to which a system is affected, either adversely or beneficially, by exposure to the direct and indirect effects of climate change (Bell et al. 2011). Direct effects on crop productivity would include a response to changing temperature whereas an indirect effect could be crop damage caused by floods, landslides, etc. Assessing sensitivity requires an understanding of threshold limits. Very sensitive species or systems will have low threshold limits and therefore even relatively small changes in the climate will elicit a response; the timing and duration of the exposure can have a significant influence on sensitivity. The combination of
8

CHAPTER 1
exposure and sensitivity results in a potential impact; however, the response to this impact will depend on the sensitivity and adaptive capacity of the system.
Adaptive capacity (A) is described as ‘the ability of a system to adjust to climate change (including climate variability and extremes), to moderate potential damages, to take advantage of opportunities or to cope with consequences’ (IPCC 2001). The IPCC distinguishes between autonomous adaptation, where existing knowledge and technology is utilised in response to the changes in climate experienced, and planned adaptation, where adaptive capacity is strengthened by implementing policies to bring about effective adaptation as well as investment in new technologies and infrastructure (Parry et al. 2007).
The resilience of a system is based on its ability to absorb shocks and to bounce back, for which certain conditions are necessary, namely the abilities to self-organise, to buffer disturbance and have the capacity for learning and adapting (Tompkins et al. 2005). Increasing resilience can be achieved by reducing exposure to risk, reducing sensitivity and strengthening adaptive capacity. For example, an ongoing pest or disease problem could be exacerbated by a changing climate. Addressing this problem now will reduce risk in the future and increase the resilience of the system. General resilience, being ‘about coping with uncertainty in all ways’ (Folke et al. 2010) avoids the risk that too much focus on a specified resilience can result in a loss of resilience in other ways (Cifdaloz et al. 2010).
1.2.2 Reducing vulnerability
Reducing sensitivity will decrease vulnerability. For example, projected climate change is likely to increase the possibility of taro leaf blight (TLB) in certain countries currently free of the disease. Therefore the cultivation of TLB-resistant varieties now would help to reduce sensitivity and, to some extent, exposure to the disease in that the presence of resistant varieties will reduce the level of disease inoculum available for infection. Similarly, reducing sensitivity to drought could be achieved by cultivating drought resistant varieties within an agroforestry system. Cultivating varieties with specific climate tolerant traits is not the only way to reduce vulnerability, as described in Chapter 4. Enhancing the genetic diversity within a crop gene pool by increasing the inter- and intra-specific diversity being cultivated, also improves the resilience of the system.
Vulnerability to climate change has different dimensions as the focus turns from plants, trees and animals through agricultural systems and landscapes, to individuals, households, communities and countries. Individual plants, trees and animals have vulnerabilities to changes in climate, which can be assessed by considering their physiological thresholds or limits within different emission scenarios. The vulnerability of agricultural systems can be modified by changing practices, such as altering planting dates and changing the mix of varieties or species.

1.3 Adaptive capacity
Adaptive capacity considers the farmers and communities involved in agriculture and forestry. It is a product of natural, human, physical, social and financial capital, and is the means by which we can understand whether environmental change will impact communities. Moser et al. (2010) consider that the amount and diversity of assets held by a community determine the level of vulnerability to climate change. An asset is defined as a ‘stock of financial, human, natural or social resources that can be acquired, developed, improved and transferred across generations. It generates flows or consumption, as well as additional stock’. Larger amounts and diversity of assets increase the resilience of communities to climate change. Adaptive capacity can explain why some communities may be less at risk than modelling studies portray. For example, Adger et al. (2004) report that previous research in coastal environments has shown that social capital, which comprises networks and relationships between individuals and social groups that facilitate economic well-being and security, is an important element for coping with climate variability and hazard in the present day. Adaptive capacity will be further discussed in Chapter 10. 1.3.1 Natural capital The Pacific Islands comprise more than 20,000 islands and atolls in 28 countries and territories often referred to as Oceania. The region covers a third of the earth’s surface and is home to an estimated 10 million people on islands with a land area of 550,000 km2 surrounded by the largest ocean in the world.
Figure 1.2 The three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia. (source: Bell et al. 2011). 10

CHAPTER 1
Twenty-two of these countries and territories are members of the Pacific Community (SPC),3 and are referred to in this book as Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs). Five island members of SPC (Fiji, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Solomon Islands and Vanuatu) account for 90% of this total land area and more than 85% of the population. The region is also home to some of the world’s smallest island countries and territories, such as Nauru, Tuvalu and Tokelau.
The Pacific region is generally referred to as three sub-regions: Melanesia, Polynesia and Micronesia. The large size of the high islands in Melanesia and prevailing weather conditions have provided good opportunities for agriculture, fisheries, and forestry, thus supporting the expansion of human settlements. Rainfall is higher than in the low-lying islands further east, but there are strong spatial variations in rainfall with windward (usually eastern) slopes typically receiving more rain than the leeward (usually western) slopes.

The islands within Polynesia and Micronesia vary greatly in size, and are smaller in land area than Melanesia. Atolls (ring reefs formed around a completely submerged peak) are found in all three sub-regions. In atoll nations such as Tuvalu and Kiribati reef islands provide the only habitable areas.

3 The 22 Pacific Island countries and territories are American Samoa, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, Kiribati, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Caledonia, Niue, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Pitcairn Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Wallis and Futuna.

Atolls are found in all three sub-regions

Land mass accounts for only 2% of the entire Pacific region of 30,000,000 km2. It is unevenly distributed throughout the region which, together with the largely traditional land tenure system, places intense pressure on the available arable land to provide for housing, food, waste disposal, fresh water and other resources. On small atoll islands, land availability is an overwhelming constraint. Systems of ownership, inheritance and use are complex and vary greatly across the region, but generally land is mostly vested in groups based on common descent, place of residence, and participation in social and economic activities. Land means identifying with a family, a clan, a lineage, and is therefore valued for its symbolic value, not just because it meets most subsistence requirements.

Agriculture has supported Pacific communities for thousands of years, but in recent years, population growth, deforestation and the intensification of crop production for commercial purposes has threatened the very foundation of agriculture: the soil. Soil condition and fertility vary considerably across the Pacific, with more fertile and productive soils found in volcanic islands. The loss of soil fertility threatens the productivity of crops, and soil erosion through run-off into the sea is damaging the coral reefs on which island communities largely depend for their protein.

The survival of many communities is fundamentally linked to the state of their freshwater resources, whether these occur as rivers and streams, underground aquifers, or rainwater collected from roofs. These resources are essential for basic human needs such as drinking, washing and cooking, and are also vital for agriculture in all its forms. Across the region, agriculture has been developed alongside and reliant upon these freshwater resources. Both commercial and selfsufficiency agriculture has progressed on the basis of fresh water availability.

12

CHAPTER 1
On atolls, surface water resources are usually non-existent and fresh groundwater resources, which exist as thin freshwater lenses floating over seawater, can be very limited. Storage and availability of fresh water is also constrained by very small land areas, aquifer geology, demand from both human settlements and agricultural activities, and waste disposal issues.
Forests have always been an integral part of the lives of communities, particularly on high islands. In fragile island ecosystems, forests, agroforests and trees, and their associated biodiversity, are vital for economic prosperity and building resilience to all forms of change. Forests, and trees outside forests, provide food and fodder, traditional medicines, wood for building materials, implements and fuel, and products for local sale and export. Forests also provide vital ecological services, such as coastal and watershed protection, soil replenishment, water purification and conservation, and also act as reservoirs of biodiversity (habitat for pollinators and countless other important plants and animals) and carbon (both as a carbon stock and sink). The loss of forest areas through agriculture conversion, forest degradation arising from unsustainable harvesting, forest clearance for development and plantation establishment, is likely to enhance sensitivities associated with the effects of climate change.

1.3.2 Human capital
The population of the region, estimated at 10.5 million in mid-2013, is growing at about 2% per annum4. The high growth rates are predominately driven by Melanesia, especially PNG. The populations of PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu are all projected to double by 2050 (Table 1.1), at a time when climate change impacts are expected to be more pronounced. Of the Melanesian countries, Fiji, due to outmigration, has a low overall population growth, with the majority of the population now living in urban and peri-urban areas. In 2007, the urban population was 51% and at the current rate of growth is projected to reach 61% by 20305. The western Melanesian countries (PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu) all have overwhelmingly rural populations, but urban population growth exceeds rural population growth in all Melanesian countries except PNG. Food production in some locations is becoming increasingly difficult because of population pressure, as can be seen in parts of the PNG Highlands and north Malaita in Solomon Islands (Rogers and Martyn 2009). Increasing population, especially in urban areas, increases the demand for imported food.
Population growth in Cook Islands, Samoa and Tonga has been moderated by outward migration to neighbouring New Zealand, Australia and the United States. A similar process also exists in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Palau and the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), with movement to urban Guam, Honolulu and the west coast of the United States.

CHAPTER 1

Some of the smaller PICTs (Guam and Nauru) are experiencing high rates of population growth, whereas others, such as Niue and Tokelau are seeing their populations decline. Some smaller PICTs have a high percentage of rural dwellers (FSM, Kiribati, Niue, Tokelau, Tuvalu, Wallis and Futuna), while others have largely urban societies (Guam, RMI, Nauru, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), Palau, Cook Islands)

The aggregate age profile across the region is: 0–14 (37.3%), 15–24 (19.5%) 25–59 (38%), and 60+ (5.2%)6.

The Human Development Index (HDI) focuses on human elements of development, combining indicators of health and education with the more traditional economic indicators. The Index can help to identify key development needs and assist in determining cost-effective strategies for human development. Table 1.2 below shows the rankings of 10 Pacific Islands in the 2013 Human Development Report (UNDP 2013). Most countries ranked in the ‘medium’ human development category. When compared with other small developing island states in the report, Palau, Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa are all doing better in terms of human development7. PNG and Solomon Islands are notable, however, in having a low HDI and they rank 156 and 143 out of 187 in the world. Average life expectancy in PNG is 10 years less than in Tonga.

In September 2011, the Pacific Forum Leaders acknowledged that non-communicable diseases (NCDs) (diabetes, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, heart disease including hypertension and stroke) have reached epidemic proportions in the region and are creating a ‘human, social and economic crisis’, requiring an urgent and comprehensive response8. Many studies have discussed how the change from a diet of predominantly root vegetables, coconuts and fresh fish to one consisting of bread, rice, tinned fish, and more processed foods high in sugar and salt have contributed to the escalation of NCDs (World Bank 2012). Improving access and availability of local, more nutritious foods would help to minimise the contribution of diet to NCDs (Snowdon et al. 2010).

CHAPTER 1
1.3.3 Social Capital Social capital as it relates to climate change has been described as ‘close bonds within communities, and networks of relations between communities and external organisations, that enable informed, collective, and coordinated responses to manage climate risks’ (Commonwealth of Australia 2012). The socio-ecological systems of the Pacific region have historically adapted well to environmental change. Local knowledge sustained over generations, through a variety of traditional and cultural practices maintained via informal education and oral tradition, has been the basis of this ability to adapt, as well as the social safety net provided by community cooperation and collaboration. Although these systems are arguably not as strong as they once were, especially in the more urban and peri-urban areas, the level of community cooperation that exists in the PICTs, and which is maintained through ceremony, feasting and exchange of goods, can provide the social capital important for climate change adaptation. The local knowledge held by communities is also a crucial resource for any community-based adaptation strategy.
Understanding social and community structures and functions is important when implementing policies and activities in PICTs. Distinct differences in social organisation and cultural practices exist between the three sub-regions. For example, throughout Melanesia, social and political status and power are usually acquired on the basis of individual merit and effort, whereas in most of Polynesia patrilineal descent is the deciding factor. In Micronesia, the situation is more complex: on high islands and more fertile atolls, close similarities to the Polynesian system are found, whereas on the smaller atolls, age plays a more prominent role; political responsibility is traditionally exercised by a council of elders (Haberkorn and Jorari 2007).
In Polynesia and parts of Micronesia, sharing of information is generally broad-based and often systematic, with support from government, village and church committees. In Melanesia and parts of Micronesia, sharing of information has traditionally been constrained, firstly by the diversity of languages and cultures, and secondly by the fact that traditionally, women are not expected to contribute in meetings of mixed sexes, thus in many cases separate meetings for the sexes are called for.
17

In Melanesia and most of Micronesia, the role of food production (crop, forestry and animal) and food preparation belongs to women, while commercial crops, forestry and animal production are the responsibility of men. Children and other household members help out with the labour as required in food production, and supplement labour requirements in commercial agriculture production. In Polynesia and in parts of Micronesia, women’s role in agriculture and forestry is typically confined to preparation and storage of crops after harvesting in addition to food preparation or processing and selling of the produce.

Women tend not to have access to the key information and education critical for adapting to a rapidly changing climate (McOmber et al. 2013). This is due to many factors linked to tradition (as previously stated) and work burdens. At best, this reduces their potential to contribute to household, community and national responses and at worst their vulnerability to extreme weather events is increased. It is crucial that women are fully involved in the development of climate change adaptation strategies and in capacitybuilding related to climate change, as it is women who tend to remain behind to run farms and gardens when men move away to seek employment in urban areas.

Understanding the gendered division of labour within Pacific communities can assist in providing more in-depth understanding of community perspectives on changes to climate and the environment. It can also provide a useful entry point for harnessing specialised knowledge in developing strategies for adapting to climate change. Adaptation solutions must build on the diverse knowledge, priorities and capacities of both women and men. Further, promoting equitable access to adaptation knowledge for women and men is a key practical step for inclusive adaptation.

18

CHAPTER 1
1.3.4 Physical capital
Poor infrastructure, including roads, ports, shipping, transport, communications and markets, contributes significant constraints to agricultural development (Rogers 2008). Physical capital can be very climate sensitive, with poor-quality infrastructure more easily and severely affected, especially by extreme weather events. A Community Based Vulnerability Assessment (CBVA) carried out by SPC in Samoa after Cyclone Evan reported major infrastructure damage (roads, bridges, water and electricity supply), and despite reasonably quick recovery, significant effort was needed to return to a pre-Evan state. As highlighted in several reports, investment in agriculture will only reap benefits if combined with improvements in infrastructure and market access (Abbot and Pollard 2004). The importance of marketing infrastructure is further highlighted in Section 1.5.6.

1.3.5 Financial capital
CBVAs conducted by SPC Land Resources Division (LRD) in Fiji, Kiribati, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu showed that the most limiting capital was financial, in combination with other capitals including physical, human and natural (Halavatau pers. comm). Financial capital includes the level, variability and diversity of sources of income, and access to other financial resources, such as credit and savings, and is obviously important with regards to cushioning shocks from extreme weather events, diversifying options and taking on board new technologies. In Fiji, the Women’s Social and Economic Development Programme (WOSED) is implementing the Grameen Banks model of microfinance, where social capital is used as collateral. They are targeting disadvantaged women and providing small loans, of which 70% are used for agricultural activities (Deacon 2012).

19

1.4 Importance of agriculture to Pacific economies and communities
Any assessment of the importance of the agricultural sector to Pacific economies and communities needs to take into account the great diversity that exists between the PICTs in the region. Countries such as Tuvalu (population less than 11,000) and PNG (population approaching 7.5 million) have little in common other than proximity. For those PICTs where agriculture is of fundamental importance for food security, livelihoods and economic development, climate change is likely to have a significant impact, especially in the longer term. In those PICTs where agriculture is of minor importance and food security is more dependent on imports, the direct impact of climate change on agriculture will be less, but it is highly likely that climate change will drive up the prices of imported foods, threatening food security and hindering any possible agricultural development.
To facilitate analysis of the agriculture sector for such a diverse range of PICTs the following groupings have been proposed based on resource endowments, size and the importance of their agriculture sector (McGregor et al. 2008).
yy Group 1: relatively large PICTs of Melanesia (PNG, Fiji, Solomon Islands, New Caledonia and Vanuatu). Of these, PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu (Western Melanesia) and Fiji have been selected for analysis.
yy Group 2: middle-sized PICTs of Polynesia (Samoa, Tonga and French Polynesia). Of these, Samoa and Tonga have been selected for analysis.
yy Group 3: land-poor micro-states that are predominantly atolls. (FSM, Kiribati, Niue, Tokelau, Tuvalu, Wallis and Futuna, Guam, RMI, Nauru, CNMI and Cook Islands). Of these, Kiribati and Tuvalu have been selected for analysis.
Traditional food production in the Pacific is based on agroforestry. The most common is shifting cultivation or slash and burn rain-fed gardens associated with arboriculture of local fruit and nut species. In a given area farmers will cultivate land for about three years before abandoning it for a much longer period. In the drier areas such gardens were often dominated by yams, and in the more humid areas, taro was found. But many other food crops were also cultivated, (including banana, sweet potato, sugar cane, kava, aibika,9 leafy vegetables and other minor species; all crops of good nutritional value, and with little dependence on external inputs or extension services). These multi-crop garden systems, protected by trees within the garden and often by forest (primary or secondary) reduced risk from disasters. These systems were adjusted for resource endowments, the seasons, and occasional natural disasters.
Families often had several traditional food gardens, albeit relatively small, which used the best locations for particular crops, maintained the use of land, and importantly, reduced the risk of all crops being lost at one time. In Vanuatu, three food gardens were established for each year in a three-year period, but since the early eighties, the

CHAPTER 1
number of food gardens has significantly decreased. At the present time only one garden is established for each of the years within the three-year period (Lebot pers. comm). This has greatly increased the food security vulnerability of households to cyclones. Vanuatu is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, being located in one of the most cyclone-prone parts of the south-west Pacific (McGregor and McGregor 1999).

Strategic planting timetables and sequential harvesting techniques also enhanced food security. SPC (2011) further notes that:

“These structurally complex agro-forestry systems buffer crops from large fluctuations in temperature, keeping crops closer-to-optimal growing conditions. Shade trees protect crops from lower precipitation and reduced soil water availability and improve soil water infiltration. Such agro-forestry systems also help protect crops from extreme storm events” (p 9).

As well as complex and shifting multi-crop gardens, intensive permanent cultivation also existed; for example, taro cultivation in irrigated terraces or permanent compost pits on atolls. Moreover, there was also an extensive use of wild plants, such as ferns and other greens (Thaman 1982).

Throughout the region free-range chickens and pigs are an integral part of selfsufficiency production, whereas larger commercial pig and chicken production systems are only found in Fiji and PNG. Vanuatu has a notable beef industry based on smallholder cattle farms and larger holdings. A significant beef cattle sector is present also in New Caledonia. Fiji has a significant dairy and goat industry and also a small sheep industry.

The integration of agriculture to the global economy commenced with colonisation and the production of commodities such as copra, sugar, coffee and cocoa. This development of cash cropping has led to a more permanent occupation of land. The commercial production of taro in Fiji and Samoa, ginger in Fiji, kava on the sloping lands of Fiji and the FSM, and squash in Tonga, has generally resulted in increased soil erosion, reduced yields and decreased household food security (Buresova and McGregor 1990; SPC 2011).

CHAPTER 1

FAO data suggest that since the 1960s agricultural production has been increasing steadily across the region. These production increases, however, are mainly attributable to increases in the area of land farmed rather than increases in productivity. FAO data indicate that productivity (measured by yield) has only improved marginally since the 1960s and has actually declined since the late 1990s (Figure 1.5).

Figure 1.3 Production, area harvested and yield of food crops in the Pacific 1960-2012 (source: FAO Statistics database, October 201310). Data for livestock production is very difficult to compile because in most of the PICTs the majority of livestock production is not recorded in the absence of slaughterhouses and meat inspection services (Manueli pers.comm)
A more in-depth analysis of the importance of agriculture is discussed in the following sections using the areas listed below:
yy Economic growth and trade yy Food security yy Livelihoods
1.4.1 Economic growth and trade
1.4.1.1 Group 1: Melanesia (Fiji, PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu) The economic growth performance of Melanesian countries over the last decade has been erratic and overall has barely kept up with the growth in population (Tables 1.1 and 1.3). PNG, after a negative and low growth experience at the beginning of the decade, has experienced exceptionally high real growth rates in recent years (11% in 2011), due to a surge in mineral and energy exports, particularly commodities such as oil, copper and gold.
10 Data for American Samoa, Cook Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, Kiribati, Nauru, New Caledonia, Nuie, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Wallis and Futuna.
23

In PNG the total value added created by agriculture makes up a high percentage (36%) of GDP (Table 1.4). PNG is also by far the region’s largest agricultural exporter, with exports in 2011 equivalent to USD 1.28 billion; nearly six times that of Fiji, the region’s next largest agricultural exporter, but less than 20% of the share of total exports. Minerals, petroleum and logs, outputs of the extractive industries, dominate PNG’s export earnings, generating a large foreign exchange that has not, by and large, been converted into more sustainable long-term industries such as agriculture and agroforestry. In PNG significant disparities exist in the income earned by the largely urban and mining enclaves compared with rural, largely informal areas, which is where 94% of PNG’s poor live (ADB 2012).
Solomon Islands experienced significant negative growth between 2000 and 2002 when commodity exports ceased due to social unrest and the resulting collapse of law and order. Since 2003 Solomon Islands has experienced a strong recovery driven by exports of logs and post-crisis aid inflows, together with agricultural commodities and tuna exports. However, 50% of the value of exports comes from the unsustainable exports of logs sourced from native forests. Agriculture accounts for around 20% of total exports with modest production growth achieved through cocoa and palm oil. Thus, Solomon Islands could face a major economic crisis with the imminent collapse of log exports during the course of the decade.
Vanuatu has displayed the most consistent positive growth performance over the last decade, principally driven by tourism and construction (Howes and Soni 2009). The contribution of Vanuatu’s agriculture to GDP is relatively low at 23% compared with western Melanesian countries; however, this figure could be misleading due to the method used to calculate the contribution of subsistence agriculture to GDP, which may significantly underestimate its importance (Bain 1996). In recent years Vanuatu’s agricultural products have made up around 80% of total export earnings; by far the highest of any Pacific Island country. Vanuatu has no mineral exports and very limited forestry exports.
Fiji has experienced the lowest average growth of the Melanesian countries over the last decade or so, and the lowest agricultural share of GDP at 13%. Overall slow growth can be attributed to disruptions caused by a number of coups and the steady decline in Fiji’s sugar industry. Fiji’s modest growth in fresh fruit and root crop exports has so far not been sufficient to offset this decline. That said, Fiji does have a diversified export trade portfolio and like Vanuatu has managed to offset some of its trade imbalance with tourism receipts as well as aid and remittances.
As discussed, agriculture plays a key role in the economies of Melanesia. Consequently the impact of climate change on agriculture in these countries will have major implications for economic growth and trade.

1.4.1.2 Group 2: Polynesia (Samoa and Tonga)
For the first half of the decade Tonga and Samoa enjoyed strong economic growth (Table 1.5), and with a low population growth, per capita income increased significantly. However, in the second half of the decade the Tongan economy has experienced minimal growth and the Samoan economy has slowed considerably.
Agriculture’s share of GDP for Tonga is about double that of Samoa, which is about the same as Fiji (Table 1.6). In both countries, agriculture’s contribution to GDP is significantly less than it is for the countries of western Melanesia. In Samoa, for example, the service sector now comprises over 60% of GDP and employs some 30% of the labour force (AusAID 2012).
Both Tonga and Samoa have large trade imbalances. The value of exports averages less than 10% of the value of imports although agricultural products do make up a relatively high proportion of these limited exports. Trade imbalances have, to date, been offset by remittances sent by diaspora communities and aid inflows. Samoa’s agricultural export sector has been in sharp decline since the early 1990s due to weather-related disasters. Cyclones Ofa (1990) and Val (1991) destroyed approximately 20% of the coconuts growing at the time and spelt the end of the once substantial cocoa export industry. Taro leaf blight (1993)11 saw taro exports fall to virtually zero and exports are yet to recover to any significant extent.

11 See Chapter 4 for a discussion on the relationship between taro leaf blight and climate.
25

During the 1990s Tonga was unusual in that economic growth was led by export agriculture, principally squash exports to Japan and vanilla to the United States (Sturton 1992). The average annual value of squash exports to Japan from 1991 to 1994 was around USD 10 million. However, the industry has faced both marketing and sustainable production problems, particularly in terms of Tonga’s fragile water resources, and value of squash exports is now only 10% of the level a decade ago, with no significant replacement agricultural export earner in place.

The importance of agriculture to the economies of Samoa and Tonga has declined substantially from what it was some two decades ago. The sector is less important to these economies than it is for the countries of Melanesia. Consequently the impact of climate change on agriculture in Polynesia can be expected to have fewer implications for economic growth and trade, compared with Melanesia.

The growth performance of the micro-states has been highly erratic and, on average, poor (Table 1.7) and below the growth in population for most of these countries (Table 1.1). The per capita income of Kiribati stands at around the equivalent of USD 1,600, approximately the same as Solomon Islands and slightly below that of PNG. Tuvalu, FSM and the RMI all have per capita incomes just above USD 3,000. Palau enjoys a much higher per capita income due to the contribution of tourism.
Agriculture’s contribution to GDP is mainly through self-sufficiency activities. In Tuvalu, despite severe constraints faced by terrestrial food production, agriculture value added accounted for 23% of GDP in 2011; however, this figure is more a measure of material impoverishment than of the strength of the sector. The 2010 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) estimates that around 20% of household income comes from self-sufficiency activities, confirming the high percentage of GDP estimate for self-sufficiency. For the more affluent micro-states of the northern Pacific

26

CHAPTER 1

the contribution of agriculture to GDP is considerably less. For example, in Palau, agriculture and fisheries constituted 3.1% of GDP while services constituted 62% of the economy in 200512.

The micro-states have even more extreme trade imbalances than those faced by the mid-sized Polynesian countries. The trade merchandise of Kiribati is typical, where over the period 2003 to 2010 the value of exports averaged only 6% of the value of imports. To date these micro-states have largely been able to offset their large trade imbalance through a combination of foreign income remittances, aid inflows and in some cases, tourism and fishing licence receipts.

Agriculture is much less important to the economies of the micro-states than it is to Melanesian and Polynesian countries, and as such economic growth and trade in the micro-states will be less affected by the impact of climate change on agriculture.

1.4.1.4. Summary
Agriculture’s importance for economic growth and trade of the three groups of PICTs can be summarised as:
yy Group 1 – major importance
yy Group 2 – moderate importance
yy Group 3 – minor importance
Accordingly, the impact of climate change on agriculture is expected to have major implications for Group 1 economies, moderate implications for Group 2 economies and minor implications for Group 3 economies. Chapters 4, 5 and 6 discuss these impacts in detail for specific crops, while Chapter 9 endeavours to translate these impacts into growth and foreign exchange consequences.

1.4.2 Agriculture and food security
Agriculture and food security are closely linked and therefore the impact of climate change on agriculture will have significant consequences for food security. Chapter 9 analyses in some detail the expected impact of climate change on food security; the following discussion establishes the baseline for that analysis.
The World Food Summit, 1996, defined food security as ‘when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life’.13 This definition highlights the four key dimensions of food security: adequate food supply; available food supply; stability of food supply and access to food at the household level.
Traditional farming systems, as previously described, have provided resilience against external shocks and helped to maintain food security (McGregor et al. 2008). Today threats to food security have intensified with the move away from the more resilient agro-ecosystems of the past, and with increasing population and urbanisation. The projections for climate change add a further threat, by increasing the vulnerability of food production systems both within the region and beyond.
The Food Import Capability Index (FICI), developed by FAO, is the ratio of food imports to total mercantile exports and is used as the aggregate measure of a country’s food security. The premise on which the FICI has been established is that a country’s food security depends on its ability to both produce and buy food. A country with a FICI greater than 50% is considered vulnerable in terms of food security. However, with climate change an over-reliance on imported food the supply of which is externally determined, increases vulnerability. Further, any analysis of food security must also consider the reliability of income to purchase food and the access to that income at the local and household level.
1.4.2.1 Group 1: Melanesia (Fiji, PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu)
Agriculture is the basis of food security where there is a solid foundation for food availability through self-sufficient production of staple and other food crops, and also through export earnings generated from agriculture products.
PNG has a FICI of less than 10%, indicating a high level of food security (Table 1.8). Yet an estimated 1.3 million people in PNG live in urban centres or non-village locations, with no opportunity to grow food, and an insufficient income with which to purchase adequate quantities of nutritious food (Bourke and Harwood 2009). Many households do not receive the flow-on income benefits from mineral exports, responsible for PNG’s positive trade balance. Similarly, in Solomon Islands, with a low

CHAPTER 1

food security vulnerability (FICI of 30%), the income generated by unsustainable log exports does not reach the population at large. According to the FICI, Fiji and Vanuatu have moderate and high food security vulnerability respectively; however, income from tourism in both countries helps to offset the substantial mercantile deficit (McGregor et al. 2009).

All Group 1 countries have strong domestic staple food production (Bourke and Harwood 2009; McGregor et al. 2009). However, they all suffer from significant levels of malnutrition, as shown by the high levels of stunting in children under five; high levels of obesity and non-communicable diseases (mainly in urban areas), and micronutrient deficiencies such as iron, vitamin A and iodine (SPC 2011).
Group 1 countries, with their substantial land resources and strong agricultural base, have significant potential to enhance their food security through agriculture, both through self-sufficiency and export production. Fiji, however, with an overreliance on imported foods, is more vulnerable to external shocks, such as the 2008 food crisis. As Chapter 4 discusses, climate change could result in such an external shock through a real increase in the price of imported grain. The rate of growth of urbanisation in all countries is also an increasing threat to food security.

29

1.4.2.2 Group 2: Polynesia (Samoa and Tonga)
The FICI of both Samoa and Tonga indicates extreme food security vulnerability (Table 1.9). These countries have been able to purchase sufficient imported food with foreign exchange provided by remittances and aid transfers. Increasing consumption of imported food with generally higher levels of sugar, salt and fats has been linked to the increased incidence of obesity and diabetes seen in both countries.14

Maintaining the current level of food imports is only possible if remittances remain at their current high value. However, both countries do have a strong traditional subsistence base as demonstrated by Samoa with its response to the loss of taro production from taro leaf blight (Chapter 4), indicating the food security buffer that agriculture can provide when needed.

1.4.2.3 Group 3: The Micro-states
These countries have a low capacity to produce food domestically and to generate export earnings. Thus, almost all purchased food is imported. Consequently, the FICIs for the atoll countries are very high suggesting that these countries are amongst the most food-insecure countries in the world. For example, the average FICI for Kiribati in the period 2008–2010 was 750%. The outer island communities of these countries are more involved in self-sufficiency food production, with the marine sector being far more important than agriculture.15 Cyrtosperma merkusii, (swamp taro) remains important in the outer islands of some atoll countries.16

1.4.2.4. Summary

All three PICTs’ groupings rely on agriculture for food security, with Group 1 being more reliant than Group 2 or Group 3. Levels of food security vulnerability vary both between and within the three groupings. The larger Melanesian countries have good natural resources with which to strengthen agriculture’s contribution to food security. Increasing urbanisation, especially in some of the small micro-states and Melanesia, and high population growth rates, especially in Melanesia, present a significant challenge both for food production and the generation of sufficient income to ensure future food security. However, all PICTs, even the smaller micro-states, could enhance food security and thus their resilience to climate change through strengthening production practices for traditional crops. Chapter 4 pays particular

15 According to FAO per capita fish consumption in the micro-states is twice as high as it is in Polynesia and three or

four times higher than it is in Melanesia (FAO 2010).

16 The value of pulaka to subsistence in Tuvalu is second only to fish and marine products. The 2004 HIES estimated

that the total value of pulaka consumed by households to be AUD 1.8 million, of which most came from the outer

islands. The estimated value for pulaka per household in the outer islands is AUD 1700 but only AUD 61 for

CHAPTER 1
attention to strengthening traditional food production systems and discusses the opportunities that exist if this is achieved.
1.4.3 Agriculture and livelihoods Livelihood has been defined as ‘the activities, assets and access that jointly determine the living gained by an individual or household’ (Ellis 2000). Agriculture is the main source of livelihoods in western Melanesia, and is also important in Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Cook Islands, Kiribati, FSM and Tuvalu (SPC 2011). Thus future climate change impacts on agriculture in these countries will directly and significantly affect livelihoods. Chapters 4, 5 and 6 discuss these impacts for specific crops in detail, while Chapter 9 tries to translate these impacts into consequences for livelihoods. The discussion below briefly establishes the current baseline as it relates to agriculture and livelihoods.
1.4.3.1 Group 1: Melanesia (Fiji, PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu) Countries in this grouping rely heavily on agriculture for employment and livelihoods. In PNG more than 50% of rural households generate some income from Arabica coffee (Bourke and Harwood 2009). In lowland locations, a further million people derive their income from the sale of cocoa and/or copra. The vast majority of these people receive very little, if any, income from the mineral boom in PNG. According to Vanuatu’s 2006 Agricultural Census, 71% of Vanuatu’s rural households earned income from coconuts, and received little or no income from tourism. In Solomon Islands, according to the Agricultural Census (last conducted in 1999), 80% of rural households earned income from copra and around 20% sold cocoa. Very few of these households will have earned any income from log exports. The Fiji sugar industry still directly employs about 13% of the labour force and 17,000 people are directly or indirectly dependent on the export of taro for their livelihood (Koka Siga Pacific 2012). Income derived from agricultural products sold at domestic markets is also an important source of livelihoods. In PNG, 90% of the rural population live in areas where income is derived from the sale of fresh food, an income estimated to be second only to the income derived from the sale of coffee (Bourke and Harwood 2009).

1.4.3.2 Group 2: Polynesia (Samoa and Tonga)
Although Samoa’s and Tonga’s export agriculture has declined since the early 1990s domestic trade in locally grown goods has continued to thrive. In Samoa, following the TLB disaster significant substitution of other traditional staples for taro has taken place (Chapter 4). In Tonga, as with Samoa, large volumes of food are domestically traded. In Tonga, the 2011 HIES confirmed that on average, 14% of household income is obtained from the sale of produce17.

1.4.3.3 Group 3: The Micro-states
Micro-states have very limited land resources but vast marine resources. A few micro-states earn meagre, but important, cash income from agriculture. Kiribati and the RMI intermittently continue to export small quantities of copra. A few other micro-states earn income from diversified agricultural exports, such as the Cook Islands (previously papaya, now noni juice and some floriculture products), Niue (taro) and FSM (kava and betel nut). Crop sales to domestic markets make a small contribution to household income. For example, according to Tuvalu’s most recent HIES, sales from subsistence agriculture contributed 7% of household income18. In the case of Kiribati, sales of household-grown produce provided on average 11% of household income.19 The Palau HIES shows a much lower contribution of household food production to household income with subsistence agriculture estimated to make up on average only 3% of household income and the sale of produce even less (Government of Palau 2006).

CHAPTER 1
1.4.3.4 Summary
All three PICTs’ groupings rely on agriculture for livelihoods, with Group 1 being more reliant than Group 2 or Group 3. Tree crop commodities are obviously very important in the Melanesian countries for livelihoods. Any change that affected coffee production, for example, would have a significant impact on rural livelihoods in PNG. The possible future impacts of climate change on the more important crops and forestry products that contribute to the livelihoods of Pacific Island people are analysed in later chapters.
1.4.4 A recap of the importance of agriculture to Pacific economies and communities
Agriculture has a varied importance for the socio-economic wellbeing of Pacific populations. Agriculture is extremely important for economic growth and exports of PICTs in Group 1 but less so in Group 2 and Group 3 countries. It is vital for supporting livelihoods in all PICTs, particularly in areas which rely on subsistence production; however, it is relatively more important in Group 1 due to its greater contribution to household income and employment. Relatively limited agricultural production in Group 2 and Group 3 PICTs increases their food import dependence, contributing to a higher level of food insecurity than Group 1 PICTs. This is particularly true of the PICTs in Group 3, which face greater environmental and natural resource challenges than those of Group 2 to increasing their domestic food production.
1.5 Main issues influencing agricultural productivity in the region
Climate change will, without doubt, have an impact on the agricultural sector in the Pacific; the possible impacts and how they might affect the different sub-sectors, and the timing of these impacts, is discussed in later chapters. Disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation strategies to manage both the more immediate and longterm risks from climate change are essential. However, despite the challenges from climate change, opportunities are also likely. In order to manage the risks and to take advantage of the opportunities it is vital that all challenges and constraints affecting agricultural development, both now and in the future, are acknowledged. Failure to take these into account is not only likely to exacerbate climate change impacts in the future, but will also affect the success of any climate change adaptation strategies.
1.5.1 Declining soil fertility
Shifting cultivation where land was allowed to revert to a period of bush-fallow ensured that the land was able to recover its fertility. The diversity of crops grown, with their differing nutrient requirements, also did not drain the fertility of the soil. Cash cropping, which tends to involve permanent cultivation, does not allow for this fertility recovery period and pushes traditional food production away from the villages where the people live. Evidence of declining yields of cash and staple food
33

crops exists for many locations in western Melanesia and Fiji, with similar declines reported in Samoa and Tonga. An analysis of several commercial food production systems, such as taro and ginger exports from Fiji, highlights the pest and disease problems limiting the potential of these systems. An in-depth evaluation of these pest and disease problems points to declining soil health and fertility as the underlying cause (Markham 2013). This issue is further discussed in Chapter 4.
1.5.2 Inadequate investment in agriculture
Globally and in the Pacific, agricultural sectors have suffered from under-investment, with spending on agriculture by developing country governments either declining or remaining the same between 1980 and 2004 (Hoffmann 2011). It is only recently that national governments and international donors have begun to channel their efforts towards agriculture with, for example, the World Bank choosing ‘Agriculture for Development’ as the focus of its 2008 World Development Report, and increasing its loans and investments for agriculture by 50% to USD 6 billion in 2009 (Chambwera et al. 2011).
As discussed in Section 1.3.5. CBVAs recently carried out in several PICTs indicate that lack of financial capital is a major factor influencing vulnerability. The agricultural sectors throughout the PICTs face a financing and investment crisis—a result of the withdrawal of the commercial banks, and to a large extent the development banks, from providing financial services to rural areas (AusAID 2006). There has been virtually no mobilisation of rural deposits, denying the sector a major source for investment finance. The lack of formal finance means that growth in rural small and medium enterprises (including commercial farming) has been seriously constrained. A consequence has been the dearth of such enterprises involved in wholesaling produce in most countries, which is identified as a major marketing constraint.
In all PICTs, under-resourced extension and research services currently restrict farmers’ access to the technical assistance required for improving productivity. Improved research services and technical assistance will become increasingly important as the challenges from climate change become more apparent. An overreliance on centralised research models does not necessarily ensure that benefits reach farmers, especially in largely archipelago countries where climate and environmental conditions vary over relatively short distances. The benefits of establishing a more decentralized approach to research is discussed in more detail in Chapter 5.
Limited access to inputs such as improved planting material, home garden tools, improved livestock feed, suitable breeds, veterinary support, credit and land, along with the increasing costs of livestock feeds, fertilizer and fuel inputs, constrain the opportunities for increased agricultural production and productivity. Emerging farmer organisations are expected to play an increasingly important role in providing these and other services, including decentralised research. Availability and efficient
34

CHAPTER 1
use of water, often reflecting poor investment in associated infrastructure, is also becoming a critical factor, particularly for the small atoll islands.
1.5.3 Population growth, urbanisation and labour migration
As discussed in Section 1.3.2 most of the region is experiencing rapid population growth, especially in urban areas. Urbanisation and high population growth rates in Melanesian and Micronesian countries pose a serious challenge for farming systems to produce sufficient food and at the same time create market opportunities.
Pacific production remains labour intensive, and therefore lack of labour for agriculture undermines the sector across the region. The prevailing notion that employment and higher income opportunities are only available in urban areas and in the tourism sector removes labour, especially youth, and in particular young women, from rural areas. As a result, formal education and the aspirations of rural youth and their parents tend to focus on wage employment. Farming is often perceived as the option for ‘drop outs’. Yet the experience in Fiji is that rural youth appropriately trained to use their own land can earn far more income than their urban counterparts (McGregor and Tora 2011).
Out-migration from some rural areas has created severe labour shortages that have adversely affected agricultural productivity in these locations (Fiji Ministry of Agriculture, Sugar and Land Resettlement/Asian Development Bank, 2005). The problem of rural labour shortages has been further accentuated in those countries participating in the Australian and New Zealand Pacific Seasonal Worker Scheme. These transient workers and those Pacific Islander migrants who venture overseas on a more permanent basis provide a source of financial support through remittances for the families they have left. However, remittances can encourage a dependency attitude, leading to neglect of other sources of livelihoods, as has been the case in Cook Islands, Samoa, Tokelau, Tonga and Niue (Rallu 2008). The experience in Vanuatu has been similar (Rogers pers. comm.)
1.5.4 Shortage of skills and education
The unwillingness of young people to be engaged in an agricultural enterprise is often attributed to the low prestige of the sector. Thaman (1982) discusses how changing aspirations and value systems have contributed to an under-valuing of traditional food systems and agriculture. A lack of understanding of the complexity of traditional food systems by many of the educated younger generation also contributes to the low status of agriculture, as does the perception that imported foods are ‘superior’ to traditional foods. Little has been done in the region to promote agriculture as a form of business with as much potential to enhance wealth and status as any other business.
35

Low et al. (1984) note: Effective training in agriculture is perhaps the most difficult training task. It has been taught at schools and other institutions by churches and government, small-scale and large-scale throughout the Pacific this century. Success has been very limited and the reasons many. The most innovative and intelligent youth tend to leave rural areas, the prices for tropical produce have been low, isolation can be boring, land tenure and certain social practices greatly constrain action and innovation, and Pacific social systems were designed in such a way that the older generation effectively exploit the young, who have little alternative than to be submissive. Now they can escape and they do. Moreover, the western-derived education system instills in young people certain aspirations that can only be realized in town. There is now a greater need than ever for rural youth to have the skills, motivation and access to their own resources to be able to generate worthwhile livelihoods in a sustainable way. These are the people who, in the future, must be able to meet the challenges of climate change. Working to improve the enabling environment is therefore a key part of any initiative to engage more young people in agricultural activities and enterprises (SPC 2010); their participation is essential if the agricultural sector is going to support Pacific communities, as it has in the past, in an era of climate change. Appropriate non-formal adult education has an increasingly important role to play in the area (McGregor and Tora 2011).

CHAPTER 1
1.5.5 Loss of biodiversity
Traditional self-sufficiency agriculture relied on the use of local landraces20 which are now often discarded by producers due to market pressure to cultivate specific varieties. Reducing crop diversity increases vulnerability to disease outbreaks and other natural shocks, as demonstrated by the taro leaf blight (TLB) outbreak in Samoa in 1993. Food security and livelihoods were threatened and Samoa’s main export industry came to a halt. Most of the aroids grown across the Pacific originated in Melanesia and as a result the genetic diversity of these crops declines from west to east. A narrow genetic base increases susceptibility to diseases that could become more widespread and vigorous with climate change. This issue is further discussed in Chapter 4.
Loss of biodiversity impacts on the ecosystem services essential for agricultural production, and reduces opportunities for systems to be self-buffering. The tropical Indo-Pacific area, with its centre in New Guinea, and stretching from Indonesia southward to Melanesia, eastward to Polynesia and northward to Micronesia, contains perhaps the biologically richest and most culturally diverse region on the planet. Some islands have over 80% endemic species, which occur nowhere else—yet up to 50% of the region’s biodiversity is at risk. In fact, the Pacific has some of the highest extinction rates in the world.21
1.5.6 Marketing infrastructure and market access.
Adequate roads are a basic necessity for marketing. Through much of rural Melanesia this condition is not met. Unquestionably the economic returns from a strategically placed road are high. The establishment of the Highlands Highway in the mid-1960s led to the growth of coffee as the most important industry in PNG in terms of livelihoods. However, the budgetary demands of such infrastructure are also high and rarely met, even with considerable donor support. Comparable with the challenge of maintaining adequate roads is maintaining adequate inter-island shipping services. Overall there has been a marked decline in shipping services to the more remote areas. This can be linked to the demise of the copra industry and depopulation.
Satisfactory market houses and post-harvest storage facilities also help to encourage domestic trade in agricultural products. Some municipal marketplaces are impressive in terms of the diversity and quality of products on offer; where these exist they have helped in boosting small business development and enhancing food security.

Market access can present a major challenge and act as a deterrent for farmers and agro-processors. In the past, agricultural development has put too much focus on the supply side, without sufficient consideration being given to the sale of the produce. Gaining market access often requires much effort and patience. A study released by the European Union-funded Facilitating Agricultural Commodity Trade (FACT) project found that ‘quarantine import protocols and their application are a major factor determining the ability of Pacific Island countries to maintain and expand taro exports’ (McGregor et al. 2010). Westlake (2013) discusses the difficulties concerning taro exports to Australia and the exportation of papaya from Fiji to the United States. Improvement to marketing infrastructure and market access would be vital if any policy to increase local food production and improve agriculture’s contribution to economic growth was to be successfully implemented. Improvements would have to take into account the likelihood of more frequent and more intense extreme climatic events in the future.

1.5.7 Globalisation and increasing dependency on imported food
The falling productivity of domestic food production and increasing availability of cheaper and often more convenient imported food has led to an increase in food import dependence and a dietary transition towards foods high in salt, sugar and fat.22 The availability of low-cost food imports has probably been beneficial to the calorific intake of the poor, particularly in urban areas, but with serious health consequences for the community (Evans et al. 2001).

CHAPTER 1
The elimination of tariffs and non-tariff barriers to imports has compounded PICTs’ food import dependence, and its impact upon the health of Pacific Islanders. A more nuanced approach to trade policy, globalisation and regional economic integration would see strategic use of policy and regulation (within the parameters of legal obligations at the WTO) to promote the competitiveness of domestic producers (McGregor 2006). Examples would include the use of WTO Special Products and Special Safeguard Mechanisms for developing countries, facilitating access to finance and removing domestic barriers such as price controls. International trade does provide a means by which the food requirements of a growing urban population can be met (Pinstrup-Andersen 2009), but trade must be combined with a sustainable increase in production in order to build resilience and reduce any over-reliance on imported foods (Nunn 2009). The risks of being too reliant on imported food in an era of climate change are further discussed in Chapters 4 and 9.
1.5.8 Land tenure and use
Security of ownership and tenure can unlock the economic development potential of land for food security, livelihoods and other commercial uses (SPC 2011). Secure tenure encourages farmers to maintain productivity of their land and enables them to be confident they will not waste resources and effort in land disputes. Maintenance of land productivity associated with secure tenure contributes to protecting the environment.
The system of land tenure varies between islands and cultures, but generally the cycle of cultivation and bush-fallow is typically managed by elders of the community. These elders are responsible for relatively large tracts of land, which are distributed to members of their community according to their need and status. Community members use this land to feed their own family and also to provide for community events. The safety net provided by these systems is to be admired; however, it could also act as a deterrent to producing a surplus. The system of re-allocation of land does not go hand in hand with long-term ‘land care’, (for example, practices to maintain soil organic matter) and investment in basic land improvement, (for example, fencing to keep out the feral pigs). Formal systems of commercial leases also tend to favour utilisation rather than conservation because they can be difficult and expensive to initiate and short in duration (Markham 2013).
The establishment of perennial plantations and permanent pastures represents the main cause of deforestation and contributes to increased pressure on land used for food production (Siméoni and Lebot 2012). Land degradation is one of the key environmental concerns in the Pacific (SPREP 2005). Some agricultural development has resulted in large-scale land clearance, intensification of land use and increased use of artificial fertilisers. In Fiji, for example, rapid expansion of sugar cane farms led to the cultivation of land with slopes greater than 8° (Lal 2008). This, together with poor agricultural practices including burning of fields after harvesting, has affected not only the productivity of the land itself but also resulted in land degradation and
39

increased soil erosion. Degraded land and the resulting poor soil offer little resistance to extreme climate events such as drought or floods and fail to provide stressed crops or livestock with the buffer much needed for resilience.

The complexity of issues and multiple objectives surrounding land use highlight the need for multi-level and multi-stakeholder involvement as recommended by Sustainable Land Management (SLM), and the landscape or ridge-to-reef approach. Agriculture is supported by multifunctional landscapes, which provide a wealth of ecological goods and services to the agricultural sector, of which land is one component. Ensuring the sustainable use of land and other goods and services goes beyond the agricultural sector.23

1.6 Conclusion
The importance of agriculture to food security and livelihoods throughout the region is clear. Further, the sector makes significant contributions to economic growth and foreign exchange in the larger countries. At the same time, some significant challenges are facing the region. In addition to climate change these include population growth, urbanisation, and an escalation in non-communicable diseases.
Food production systems based on multiple levels, multi-cropping and agroforestry with varying lengths of fallow periods have traditionally provided the resilience to withstand natural disasters and external economic shocks. These farming systems, where they still exist, have demonstrated sustainability in preventing loss of soil fertility, soil erosion and conserving available water, thus ensuring food and

CHAPTER 1
livelihood security for communities. In the drive for greater productivity the attributes and benefits of traditional farming systems are often forgotten.
How climate change can impact on agriculture has been discussed in many papers and reports (Chapter 3). Much of the available information has focused on crops of global importance; however, it does serve to highlight the complexities resulting from the direct and indirect impacts of climate change as well as the uncertainties regarding climate projections and impacts. Chapters 4 to 7 provide some insights into the potential impacts of climate change on self-sufficiency crops, export commodities and livestock. They highlight where the risks and opportunities can be found, and identify the knowledge gaps that need attention in order to cope with the challenges of climate change.
What is clear throughout these chapters is the need to strengthen the resilience of food production systems, and not just resilience to short-term shocks but an enduring resilience that will be able to absorb the extremes of climate variability as well as the long-term changes, such as an increase in mean temperature. With limited access to additional agricultural land the increased food supply necessary to feed a growing population will only be achieved if the development of agro-ecologically efficient systems is considered a priority.
As Section 1.5 highlights, improving agricultural productivity and enhancing resilience to cope with climate change is not just the responsibility of the agricultural sector, but requires the efforts of other sectors such as transport, health, environment and education. Countries in the region are facing challenges with respect to youth unemployment. Increasing the participation of youth in agriculture, and in particular nurturing the development of young agricultural entrepreneurs, could improve food security and youth livelihoods and reduce migration to urban areas, all of which would greatly benefit communities and reduce vulnerability to challenges such as climate change.
Finally, reducing the vulnerability of the agriculture sector must also take into account the health of communities. Currently the NCDs epidemic in the region, if not resolved, will unfold in parallel with climate change, creating unprecedented challenges for governments to manage. Diet is without doubt one of the major factors contributing to this epidemic and therefore changes in the quality of food available to communities could help in alleviating this significant health crisis. Encouraging and investing in the sustainable production and processing of local, nutritious food would seem to be a step in the right direction for addressing the NCD challenge. As will be apparent from the discussions in later chapters, increased investment in local food production and processing will help communities and countries manage some of the climate change challenges faced by agriculture, and at the same time prepare communities for when the purchase of imported grains is likely to be a less attractive option than it is at the moment. The future grain market is likely to be vulnerable to
41

climate change; therefore an increased effort now to expand sustainable local, diverse and more nutritious food production and utilisation would seem to be a healthy and sensible adaptation strategy. A healthy population is inherently more resilient than one that has to manage a whole range of debilitating diseases.

CHAPTER 2
2.1 Introduction
Climate for a particular location and time of year is a description of the typical weather conditions experienced over a representative period of time (generally a few decades). Importantly, climate also describes the typical year-to-year variations and weather extremes of a region. The natural and managed biological systems on which we rely have become attuned to these local prevailing climate conditions. Earth’s climate varies naturally over a wide range of timescales. It varies from year to year and decade to decade due to a range of factors that can be either internal (such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) or external (such as the amount of incoming solar radiation, or volcanic aerosols) to the climate system (Bindoff et al. 2013; Hartmann et al. 2013). Over much longer timescales, changes in the Earth’s position relative to the Sun have produced swings between glacial and interglacial conditions (Masson-Delmotte et al. 2013). However, since the start of the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century we have entered a new era of rapid global climate change that, while still influenced by natural cycles and forcings, is primarily driven by human actions. This is anthropogenic climate change (Stocker et al. 2013). The observational record of global land and sea surface temperature clearly shows a general warming since the mid-19th century (Figure 2.1) with the first decade of the 21st century being the warmest. Globally, average temperatures warmed ~0.89o C between 1901 and 2012 with most of this warming (~0.72o C) occurring since 1950 (Hartmann et al. 2013). This change is also reflected in the rate of warming, which has accelerated from 0.08o C/decade from 1900 to 0.11o C/decade since 1950. While the increase in global average temperature is still relatively small, the rate of humaninduced warming is unprecedented. Warming of ~4-7 o C at the end of the last glacial maximum 21,000 years ago, for example, is estimated to have occurred 10 times slower than the observed warming of the 20th century (Jensen et al. 2007).

Dashed line is linear regression for Mauna Loa (source: World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases, http://ds.data.jma.go.jp/gmd/wdcgg/introduction.html).
Recent global warming has been unequivocally linked to increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (Bindoff et al. 2013). Isotopic analysis of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), the main greenhouse gas, allows us to directly attribute this increase to the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities (Levin and Hessashimer 2000). The atmospheric concentration of CO2 has increased by more than 40% from pre-industrial levels of ~278 ppm (Hartmann et al. 2013) to 396 ppm in 2013 (www.ersl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends) with concentrations still rising rapidly (Figure 2.2).
Before projecting future climate conditions of significance to agriculture and forestry for the Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs) it is necessary to understand past and current climates, and the major drivers of seasonal, interannual and longer-term climate variability. This understanding depends upon reliable long-term observations at as many locations as possible. Such observations include long-term weather station records and measurements of large-scale atmospheric and oceanic conditions and circulation patterns. The latter is especially important as the surface climate of the PICTs is dominated by the vast tropical Pacific Ocean (Lough et al. 2011; Ganachaud et al. 2011). The sheer size and inaccessibility of much of the Pacific region means that such observational records are of limited duration and quality, especially prior to the 1950s (L’Heureux et al. 2013). Tropical cyclones, which are major weather disturbances affecting many of the PICTs have, for example, only been well documented since the advent of satellite observing systems in the 1980s.
50

CHAPTER 2
Projecting possible future climates relies on Global Climate Models (GCMs): numerical simulations of the global climate system incorporating complex physical, chemical and biological processes and their feedbacks. Many groups around the world have developed and routinely run climate models. None of these models is, however, perfect and hence we rely on combining projections from many models (multi-model ensembles) to obtain the most robust picture of possible future climates and to help quantify the uncertainties inherent in such projections. Climate models are continually refined and improved as our understanding of the global climate system grows and computational power increases. Earlier climate vulnerability studies for tropical Pacific nations (Bell et al. 2011; Australian Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO 2011) relied on output from the Climate Model Intercomparison Project 3 (CMIP3; Meehl et al. 2007a). As part of the 5th Assessment Report of the InterGovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR5), a new generation of model projections is now available (CMIP5) which we use here (Taylor et al. 2011; http:// cmip-pcmdi-llnl.gov/). These models generally operate at higher spatial resolution and include a wider range of climate processes than CMIP3.
Despite these changes, climate projections from CMIP3 and CMIP5 are not radically different and the underlying conclusions from previous assessments remain largely valid (Knutti and Sedláĉek 2013). For agricultural impact research, local- to regionalscale projections (e.g. <100 km, ideally to a site scale) of key climate variables such as seasonal temperatures, rainfall, and frequency of temperature and rainfall extremes are required. Thus, the usefulness of GCMs, which are designed to provide information on large-scale changes, for informing management decisions is still limited. It may take many years before global climate models are able to make reliable local-scale projections of temperature and rainfall characteristics (Ramirez-Villegas et al. 2013). Given, however, current rates of global warming, we do not have the luxury of waiting that long to develop and implement appropriate adaptation strategies. We must, therefore, take a pragmatic approach and rely on information based on observed climate change, current assessments of agricultural/forestry sensitivity and the best available climate projections of the future.
To make climate projections, it is necessary to specify the future trajectory of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. This depends on how society and governments respond to the challenge of rapid anthropogenic climate change; that is, the steps taken (or not) to significantly reduce (mitigate) the amount of greenhouse gases we are adding to the atmosphere. To account for these uncertainties, climate projections are based on a set of possible greenhouse trajectory scenarios. IPCC-AR3 and IPCC-AR4, as well as the earlier PICT-focused studies of Bell et al. (2011) and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO (2011), used projections based on the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) (Nakicenovic et al. 2000). As part of the recent IPCC-AR5 process, these scenarios have been replaced with a new set: the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) (Moss et al. 2010) which are named on the basis of their level of radiative forcing in 2100 (e.g. for RCP4.5, the change in
51

the balance of incoming and outgoing radiation to the atmosphere due to changes in the atmospheric composition of greenhouse gases is 4.5 W.m2) (Table 2.1). Although not directly comparable, the SRES A2 high emissions scenario, with 2100 CO2 concentrations of ~750-800 ppm, lies between the new RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Similarly, the SRES B1 low emissions scenario, with 2100 CO2 concentrations of ~500550 ppm, lies between the new RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 scenarios (Figure 2.3). RCP2.6, which has peak emissions before 2100 followed by a decline, and would constrain average global warming to ~+2o C by 2100, is now looking increasingly unachievable, especially as observed increases in atmospheric CO2 are tracking at or above RCP8.5 (Peters et al. 2013).

Different PICTs are affected by different climatological features such as the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) and the monsoon. As a result, individual PICTs will experience climate change in different ways with varying implications for agricultural and forestry productivity (Barnett 2011; Bell et al. 2011). Some changes

52

CHAPTER 2
will be relatively consistent across the region, including continued warming of air temperatures, continued increases in sea level increasing the risk of inundation, coastal erosion (Wetzel et al. 2013) and salt water intrusions (White and Falkland 2010) and, importantly, an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and consequent reduction in the length of recovery periods between such events. Other projected changes are likely to be region- or location- specific. For example, projecting changes in rainfall patterns is more complex than for temperature and sea level. At a broad scale, theory and climate models suggest that large-scale warming will cause an intensification of the hydrological cycle with regions that are already wet becoming wetter and typically dry regions becoming even drier. However, this ‘wet-gets-wetter’ pattern of projected change is complicated by other factors such as spatial variations in the magnitude of surface warming, which causes changes in wind patterns and more complex rainfall changes (Huang et al. 2013). Small-scale changes are also strongly affected by local topographic features, such as high mountains, that are not properly resolved in current climate models.
Here, we provide a framework for subsequent chapters to assess the vulnerability of agriculture and forestry in the PICTs to a rapidly changing global climate. First, we describe current climate conditions in the tropical Pacific, the primary atmospheric circulation features and their seasonal variations. Second, we describe natural sources of interannual and decadal climate variability. Third, we analyse the observational records to determine what features of the current climate have already changed with the relatively modest amount of global warming observed to date. Fourth, we examine the latest CMIP5 climate models projections for different RCP scenarios over the 21st century. We conclude with some recommendations as to how the PICTs can continue to improve understanding of their current climate, and how it is already changing, and refine future climate projections.
2.2 Present-day surface climate of PICTs
2.2.1 Climatology of the tropical Pacific
The average seasonal climate of the tropical Pacific is affected by various large-scale atmospheric features. Flanking the equator are two regions of high rainfall: the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) (Figure 2.4). Here surface winds converge over regions of warm sea surface temperatures (SST). This drives upward movement of moisture-filled air, resulting in thick clouds, deep convection and intense rainfall. This ascending air forms the upward branch of the east–west oriented Walker Circulation (Figure 2.5) which has compensating downward flow creating relatively dry conditions in the eastern tropical Pacific. Surface return flow from the eastern to the western Pacific occurs as the equatorial Trade Winds. Strong convection in the west and along the ITCZ also drives the north–south oriented Hadley Circulation with descending air and arid conditions
53

in the subtropical high-pressure cells (Figure 2.5). Near-surface winds associated with anticylonic rotation produce the meridional (north–south) Trade Winds which are predominantly northeasterly in the north Pacific and southeasterly in the south Pacific. The large-scale distribution of air temperature is closely coupled to the underlying SST. The equatorial Trade Winds push water, heated by the sun, to the west forming the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) made up of some of the world’s warmest surface waters with SST exceeding 28–29 o C (Figure 2.4c, d). In the central and eastern Pacific these same winds drive upwelling of cooler subsurface water that keeps air temperatures several degrees cooler than in the west. Year-to-year variations in the strength of the Walker Circulation and the equatorial Trade Winds, the eastward extent of the WPWP and the location of rainfall are primarily related to oscillations between El Niño and La Niña conditions (i.e. the El Niño Southern Oscillation— ENSO) (Section 2.3.1.1).
Figure 2.4 Average, 1979–2012, (a, b) rainfall and surface winds and c, d) SST for January to March (left) and June to September (right). Also shown are average locations of the ITCZ and SPCZ (red dashed line, a–d); the region affected by the WPM (defined as region of seasonal westerly winds, blue dashed line, a–b), and the edge of the WPWP (defined by 29oC isotherm, grey line, c–d) (source: surface winds and rainfall from ERA interim; HadISST, Rayner et al. 2003).

The sea-level pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin, the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), is a measure of the strength of the Trade Winds and ENSO activity. The strength of ENSO events are commonly measured using the sea-level pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin—the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) (Troup 1965) and the Niño 3.4 index of average SST anomalies between 5oN–5oS, 170o–120oW (Trenberth 1997). Convection and heavy rainfall over the WPWP and along the ITCZ and SPCZ persist throughout the year. Typically rainfall over the WPWP averages about 2000–3000 mm per year (Delcroix et al. 1996; Table 2.2). However, the seasonal movement of the Sun causes important changes to the location of these features and associated rainfall. Differences in the rate of heating between the land and ocean during the summer season for each hemisphere drive a reversal of the prevailing easterly winds and heavy rainfall in the western Pacific associated with the Western Pacific Monsoon (WPM) (Wang 2006). In the Southern Hemisphere the WPM can extend from East Timor as far as Tuvalu and Vanuatu (Figure 2.4a), while in the Northern Hemisphere it can extend from Palau as far as the Marshall Islands (Figure 2.4b). The WPM is subject to large intra-seasonal and interannual variability, with timing of the onset and termination, and wet bursts and dry breaks affected by the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) (Hendon and Liebmann 1990), mid-latitude troughs (Davidson et al. 1983) and ENSO events. The SPCZ is strongest during Austral summer, when the Southern Hemisphere WPM peaks and regional SSTs are warmest (Figure 2.4a, c). The high rainfall rates of the SPCZ extend far into the central South Pacific. During Austral winter the SPCZ contracts towards the northwest (Vincent 1994; Figure 2.4b) and occasionally, between
55

June and August, is absent and a broad undisturbed east-to-southeast wind flow prevails over the island groups. SPCZ rainfall and cloudiness varies considerably on short timescales associated with synoptic events and intra-seasonal variability due to the MJO (Vincent 1994). It also undergoes substantial movement associated with ENSO events (Vincent et al. 2011; Section 2.3.1.1).
The ITCZ persists across the Pacific throughout the year but weakens considerably from January to March. It is closest to the equator between March and May and gradually moves equatorward during Boreal spring and summer, moving ~500 km further north and becoming broader in the central and eastern Pacific during August to October (Australian Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO 2011). In the western Pacific the ITCZ extends northwards during Boreal summer when the WPM peaks (Figure 2.4b).
At higher subtropical latitudes, away from the equator, seasonal changes in the northsouth temperature difference cause the high pressure systems (Figure 2.5) to migrate poleward during summer and equatorward during winter (Barry and Chorley 2003). These high pressure systems are generally accompanied by cooler, drier conditions.
On large islands, atmospheric circulation and rainfall are significantly modified by topography. Where the prevailing winds are obstructed by mountains, the moist surface air is forced upwards and can lead to very high local rainfall rates. For example, on Fiji’s main island, Viti Levu, Suva on the southeast coast averages 3020 mm per year whereas Monasavu in the highlands averages 4970 mm. Conversely Nadi Airport on the leeward coast receives an average of 1880 mm. Heating of land and the convergence of sea breezes can also cause the development of convective cloud and rain over the larger islands in the late afternoon during the warmest months of the year.
The seasonal and spatial variations in solar energy and the resulting shifts in tropical Pacific atmospheric and oceanic circulations give rise to the seasonal changes in rainfall and temperature experienced on individual islands. Locations closer to the equator (e.g. Tarawa, Funafuti) have small seasonal ranges compared with higher latitude locations that exhibit larger seasonal variations (e.g. Nadi). Regional differences in the seasonal cycle of rainfall depend on the climatological features affecting particular islands. For example Fiji and the Marshall Islands are affected by the seasonal migration of the SPCZ and ITCZ, respectively, while Palau and Papua New Guinea are also affected by the WPM (Figure 2.6; Table 2.2).

2.2.2 Extreme events: tropical cyclones and sea level Average climate conditions can be disrupted by extreme and destructive weather events. Of particular importance for many tropical Pacific Islands are tropical cyclones, which are associated with very high rainfall rates, destructive winds and extreme sea levels (storm surges). These can affect all countries except Kiribati, Nauru and the Pitcairn Islands (Table 2.2). In the most tropical cyclone-prone regions of the PICTs (southern Vanuatu and northern New Caledonia), a tropical cyclone will pass within a ~50 km radius on average every two years (i.e. frequency = 0.5). This is markedly lower than the Philippines in the Northern Hemisphere which averages up to 1.5 cyclones per year (Figure 2.7; see also Southern Hemisphere Tropical Cyclone Data Portal, www.bom.gov.au/cyclone/history/tracks ).

Tropical cyclones derive their energy from warm surface waters and, therefore, tend to form over seasonally warm SST, such as found in the WPWP (Figure 2.4c, d). In the southwestern Pacific the highest frequency of tropical cyclones occurs between January and March (Australian Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO 2011; Diamond et al. 2012, 2013) when the WPWP shifts into the Southern Hemisphere and the SPCZ is strong (which also favours tropical cyclone formation). In the northwestern Pacific conditions are highly favourable for tropical cyclone development (Gray 1979) and they may occur throughout the year, although numbers tend to peak in August and be lowest between January and March (Chan 2005). Tropical cyclones do not form within ~5° of the equator as the Coriolis Force, generated by the Earth’s rotation, is not strong enough here to give the system the necessary rapidly rotating wind field. Because of this, equatorial PICTs are not affected by tropical cyclones and this is unlikely to change in the future (Table 2.2).
Coastal inundation from high sea-level events can cause crop and infrastructure damage and contamination of freshwater supplies. Unusually high sea levels are influenced by a number of factors:
yy Tides are the twice daily rise and fall of mean sea level driven by the gravitational interaction between the Earth, Sun and Moon and are highly predictable. The strength of the tides (i.e. tidal range and tidal currents) can vary over time; for example, variations are associated with the 28-day spring–neap cycle. The largest high and low tides (king tides) occur at times during the year when the Earth, Sun and Moon are aligned. The state of the tide can, therefore, affect the severity of impacts due to other factors that influence sea level.
yy Sea level varies due to seasonal and longer-term variations in winds, ocean temperature and sea-level pressure. For example, sea level increases (decreases) by tens of centimetres in the western tropical Pacific due to intensified (weakened) Trade Winds during La Niña (El Niño) events (Table 2.3).
yy Storms and tropical cyclones approaching an island can create storm surges. The drop in atmospheric pressure associated with these systems raises sea level by ~1 cm for each 1 hPa drop in air pressure. In addition, strong winds can force water onshore and generate large waves that push water higher onto land. While wind-generated currents tend to be localised to the regions of high winds, swell waves from storms and tropical cyclones can propagate over large distances affecting islands far afield (Hoeke et al. 2013).
These large-scale climate controls and their seasonal variations result in the average climate typical of individual islands, with 73% influenced by the SPCZ, 36% by the ITCZ, 18% by the WPM and 86% affected by tropical cyclones (Table 2.2).
60

CHAPTER 2
2.3 Observed surface climate variability and change
Superimposed on the average seasonal cycles of surface climate are natural sources of variability that modulate surface climate on timescales from weeks to decades. Here we first discuss the role of interannual and decadal variability in modulating Pacific surface climate. We then examine the evidence from observational records for climate already changing across the Pacific Islands, (i.e. significant long-term changes that exceed those expected from natural climate variability).
Data sources and importance of long, homogeneous observations
‘Meteorology Services live and die by data, but many donors don’t want to take on the ongoing maintenance costs of funding data collection equipment.’ Ofa Fa’anunu (2013) 1
To understand and document current climate conditions and how they may already be changing requires reliable, long-term, continuous, homogeneous observations of important weather elements. The Pacific Ocean covers a huge area, but only a small portion of it is routinely monitored using surface observations. It is only with the satellite era (starting in the early 1980s) that we have been able to examine Pacific Ocean climate variability as a whole. This highlights the enormous value of surface meteorological observations taken by National Meteorological Services (NMSs) over many years.
The Pacific Climate Change Science Program (PCCSP) and the Pacific-Australia Climate Change Science and Adaptation Planning Program (PACCSAP) have developed a climate database management system, Climate Data for the Environment (CliDE), specifically for 15 partner countries, 14 of which are PICTs (Table 2.2). These countries now have a modern, robust, secure and structured climate database management system to help in the provision of climate services to government, the community and researchers. CliDE has been populated with Pacific Island station data collected from in-country databases, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), New Zealand’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA), and the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) archives. During PACCSAP, limited funding was also provided to help catalogue and digitise priority station data such as maximum and minimum air temperatures, rainfall, wind, air pressure and sunshine measurements into CliDE (www.bom.gov.au/climate/pacific/about-clide.shtml ).
Quality checks were performed to produce high quality rainfall and temperature datasets and, in cases where unrealistic shifts occurred, data were homogenised using the method of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (Jones et al. 2013). The Pacific Climate Change Data Portal (www.bom.gov.au/climate/pccsp) is the current archive for homogenised data and also provides historical daily and monthly data for rainfall, maximum and minimum air temperature and mean sea-level pressure.2 The data portal provides detailed coverage for the region, including all PICTs, and allows historical climate data to be displayed over any period of interest where
1 Ofa Fa’anunu, Director of Tonga Meteorological Service, PACNEWS, July 2013. 2 The climate trends and climatologies of the Pacific Climate Change Data Portal (www.bom.gov.au/climate/pccsp)
are publically accessible. Requests for the original data are directed to the respective National Meteorological Service.
61

data are available. The NMSs can also view long-term data averages and readily extract this information for reports to government, regional organisations and others. Recently the portal has been developed further to include extreme temperature and rainfall indices based on those defined by the World Meteorological Organization Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (Peterson and Manton 2008; www.bom.gov.au/climate/pccsp/about-pi-extreme-indices.shtml).
The value to Pacific Islands of robust and reliable long-term weather observations cannot be understated. Such data are necessary both to document local climate conditions and to determine how climate is changing. Recent international aid efforts have significantly enhanced the climate data available to PICTs. There are, however, still large volumes of paper records in former colonial and Pacific countries. An imaging and digitising program would preserve these records and thus improve the breadth of the information available for the NMSs.
Ongoing collection of climatological data and enhancement of the observational networks in the Pacific Islands is of importance for both local and global scientific and socio-economic applications. There has, however, been an increase in the number of missed observations in recent years and a decline in the number of reporting meteorological stations. Network decline is primarily due to limited NMS operational budgets and increased costs of instrumentation. This decline introduces discontinuities in rare and high-quality records resulting, for example, in less comprehensive ENSO impact and historical trends and extreme climate analyses. International assistance and additional support from national governments is required to maintain these vital observational networks.
Surface climate data are complemented by sea level, sea surface height and SST data. Data used in this chapter include monthly tide gauge records from the South Pacific Sea Level and Climate Monitoring Project (www.bom.gov.au/oceanography/projects/spslcmp/spslcmp.shtml), satellite altimeter data, and reconstructed sea levels based on the methods of Church et al. (2006). We also use the HadISST SST data described by Rayner et al. (2003).
2.3.1 Interannual and decadal variability
2.3.1.1 Interannual variability
The largest differences in climate from year to year in the tropical Pacific are due to ENSO events (McPhaden et al. 2006). ENSO affects the risk of extreme events such as droughts, floods, tropical cyclones, strong winds and extreme sea levels. Consequently, ENSO can have significant impacts on agriculture, marine and landbased ecosystems, fisheries, water resources, disaster management and human health. ENSO-neutral conditions prevail in about 50% of years with the other 50% roughly split between El Niño or La Niña events. These two extremes of ENSO bring distinct surface climate anomalies to many parts of the tropical Pacific, typically develop between May and June and evolve over the following 12–18 months (McPhaden et al. 2006). The magnitude, timing and impacts of ENSO events vary from country to country but affect all PICTs apart from the Pitcairn Islands (Table 2.2). ENSO events
62

CHAPTER 2
can generally be predicted with reasonable skill about six months prior to their peak (usually from June onwards) and conditions conducive to their development are continuously monitored by various international agencies (including BOM: www. bom.gov.au/climate/ahead/model-summary.shtml#tabs=Overview, NOAA: www. elnino.noaa.gov/forecast.html and NIWA: http://www.niwa.co.nz/climate/icu/ island-climate-update-155-august-2013).
Figure 2.7 Average number of tropical cyclones per year per 1 degree boxes, 1969–2013 (source: IBtrACS, www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/ibtracs). Typically, El Niños are associated with widespread warming of SST in the nearequatorial Pacific east of the dateline between November and April (Figure 2.8a), with greatest warming between December and March. Concurrently there is a weak cooling of SST in the far western Pacific and in a horseshoe pattern surrounding the regions of warming. The opposite pattern (with cooling in the eastern and central equatorial Pacific) occurs during La Niñas. While ENSO tends to peak in Austral summer, weaker effects often extend to other seasons (Figure 2.8b). Changes in SST and atmospheric circulation patterns associated with El Niño and La Niña cause large-scale shifts in rainfall patterns. In general during an El Niño event there is an increase in rainfall in the central and eastern tropical Pacific (overlying warmer SST) with smaller rainfall deceases in the far eastern Pacific and at higher latitudes (overlying cooler SST). The opposite response occurs during La Niña events. The strength of the rainfall response varies with the magnitude of the SST changes (Figure 2.8c, d). Winds also play an important role in ENSO. For example, El Niños are initiated by bursts of westerly winds in the far western Pacific that cause circulation changes in the ocean which in turn generate SST changes. During El Niños the Trade Winds weaken and may even change direction, while they strengthen during La Niñas (Figure 2.8c, d). Rainfall changes in the western Pacific are also linked with a more northeasterly location of the SPCZ and equatorward shift of the ITCZ during El Niños and more southwesterly location of the SPCZ and a shift of the ITCZ away from the equator during La Niñas (Salinger et al. 2014). The effect of ENSO extremes on island rainfall, therefore, varies with location. Fiji, for example, typically
63

experiences wetter than normal conditions during La Niñas and drier than normal conditions during El Niños whereas northern Kiribati tends to be wetter during El Niños and drier during La Niñas (Table 2.3). The recent 2010–2011 and 2011–2012 La Niñas, for example, resulted in severe drought conditions in Tuvalu (http://www. ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/news-stories/asia-pacific/tuvalu/red-cross-respondsto-water-crisis-in-drought-stricken-tuvalu/) and floods in Fiji (www.redcross.org.au/ fiji-floods-2012.aspx).

Calculated as SST, rainfall or wind regressed against the NINO 3.4 index, 1979–2011. Box delineates the NINO 3.4 SST region which extends to 120ºW (source: rainfall and winds from Dee et al. 2011; HadISST, (Rayner et al. 2003). While ENSO events generally develop in a similar way, no two events are the same, with varying magnitude, timing and patterns of SST, wind and rainfall changes. ENSO events are commonly categorised into two types. Canonical (or ‘eastern Pacific’) El Niño and La Niña events are associated with greatest warming or cooling in the eastern equatorial Pacific (Figure 2.9a). In recent decades several El Niño events have, however, been associated with maximum warming in the central tropical Pacific, rather than in the east (Figure 2.9b; Ashok et al. 2007); called ‘central Pacific’, or ‘Modoki’ El Niño events.

These different types of events can result in different impacts on countries of the Pacific. For example, central Pacific El Niños have a much larger impact on rainfall in Kiribati and Nauru than eastern Pacific events (Australian Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO 2011). Similarly, differences in the intensity of ENSO events can result in modified climate impacts in some countries. Exceptionally strong El Niños occurred in 1982–1983 and 1997–1998 (McPhaden 1999) when both the SPCZ and ITCZ moved towards the equator and merged into one convergence zone. This caused lower than normal rainfall in Nauru and the western part of Kiribati (Gilbert Islands) rather than the above average rainfall that El Niño normally brings. In many countries (including FSM and the southern Marshall Islands in the northwest and Samoa, Niue and the southern Cook Islands in the southwest) the rainfall in these extreme El Niño years was much lower than normal and significantly drier than other El Niño years. (Table 2.3; Cai et al. 2012). The location of tropical cyclone activity also shifts with ENSO extremes (Diamond et al. 2013). During El Niños, as the warmest SST extends eastward, so does tropical cyclone activity (Figure 2.10a). In contrast, during La Niñas the stronger Trade Winds confine the warmest waters further west and tropical cyclone activity is also confined towards the western Pacific (Figure 2.10b). Thus some countries (e.g. southern Cook Islands, Niue) experience a greater risk of tropical cyclones during El Niños and others (e.g. New Caledonia) during La Niñas (Table 2.3). The changes in atmospheric and oceanic conditions during ENSO phases also affects sea level which tends to be higher than normal in the west during La Niñas and lower in El Niños.

CHAPTER 2
2.3.1.2 Decadal variability Interannual variability of surface climate due to ENSO is modulated on decadal timescales by a pattern of Pacific climate variability known as the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) or Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) (Mantua et al. 1997; Power et al. 1999; Salinger et al. 2001; Folland et al. 2002; Deser et al. 2004). The PDO and IPO are both manifestations of the same Pacific decadal climate variability and their associated indices are highly correlated; they are just defined in different ways. The IPO is an ‘ENSO-like’ pattern of Pacific SST anomalies that persists in either a warm or cool phase for several decades and the PDO can be considered as the North Pacific component of this. Warm phases in the 1920s–1940s and 1970s–1990s were linked with a weakening of interannual climate variability due to ENSO events. Cold phases in the 1900s–1920s and 1940s–1970s were associated with ENSO events being a much stronger source of interannual climate variability in the tropical Pacific. There has been a change to another cold phase of IPO since the late 1990s (Burgman et al. 2008; http://www.jisao.washington.edu/pdo/) characterised by stronger La Niñalike conditions. Thus, patterns of surface climate anomalies, and their predictability associated with ENSO events, are modulated on decadal timescales.
2.3.2 Observed variability and trends in surface climate As global temperatures warm (Figure 2.1) we are already observing large-scale changes in tropical ocean climate (Australian Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO 2011; Bell et al. 2011; Sen Gupta and McNeil 2012). For example, SSTs across much of the tropical Pacific, significantly warmed by ~0.25–0.50o C between 1950 and 1980 and 1981 to 2011 (Lough 2012). As well as warming, the WPWP is increasing in size and extending further eastwards (Cravatte et al. 2009). Sea surface salinity is decreasing (becoming fresher) in the western tropical Pacific and increasing in the southeastern tropical Pacific, consistent with an intensified hydrological cycle in the western Pacific (Durack et al. 2012; Biasutti 2013). While these salinity changes are important for understanding changes to the hydrological cycle, absolute changes are small and have no direct effect on saltwater intrusion on islands. Global average sea level is also rising (Rahmstorf et al. 2012; Church et al. 2013) but the rate of observed rise shows considerable spatial variability around the world. Here we use the available observational records from PICTs to examine changes in surface air temperatures, rainfall and sea level.
69

2.3.2.1 Temperature
Average surface air temperatures have warmed across the southern tropical Pacific since the late 19th century (Salinger 1995; Folland et al. 2003; Griffiths et al. 2005; Lough et al. 2011) and warming is also evident in the tropical north Pacific over the last half century (Jones et al. 2013; Figure 2.11). The rate of observed warming ranges from 0.05o C/decade to 0.34o C/decade with a mean warming of 0.18o C/decade averaged across all available stations for the period 1961–2011 (Whan et al. 2013). Not all the observed temperature changes will be due to anthropogenic climate change, and regional differences in warming rates may also be associated with natural interannual and decadal climate variability. Annual mean surface air temperatures at selected Pacific stations (Figure 2.12) show that on top of natural year-to-year variability there is, however, an underlying warming trend which is widespread, spatially homogeneous and statistically significant at most stations.
2.3.2.2 Rainfall
In contrast to temperature, total rainfall shows greater spatial variability in both the magnitude and sign of observed changes (Griffiths et al. 2003; Figure 2.13). Over the period 1961–2011, there are few clear trends in rainfall. Some stations have weak increasing trends (e.g. Hanan Airport, Niue), others have weak decreasing trends (e.g. Majuro, Marshall Islands) and some show no change. Statistically significant trends occur at only two of the 68 stations examined: Kiritimati, Kiribati (+110 mm/ decade) and at Hihifo, Wallis and Futuna (–150 mm/decade). A notable change is, however, evident since 1981. Rainfall has increased across most of the WPM region, south and west of the SPCZ from Vanuatu to the southern Cook Islands and in the west ITCZ region from Koror to Pohnpei in the north Pacific. Rainfall has decreased north and east of the SPCZ at Nauru, Tarawa, Funafuti, French Polynesia and Pitcairn as well as north of the ITCZ at Guam and in the Marshall Islands eastern ITCZ region. Decreasing rainfall has also occurred at two sites in New Caledonia. Just over 10% of the trends from 1981 are statistically significant (McGree et al. 2013). Natural variability, linked to ENSO and the IPO, is the main influence on rainfall changes over the past 50 years (Folland et al. 2002; Griffiths et al. 2003) with the switch to a negative IPO phase and recent dominance of La Niñas the main reason for the trends observed since 1981 (McGree et al. 2013; Salinger et al. 2014). In contrast to air temperatures, interannual variability of total annual rainfall at selected Pacific stations (Figure 2.14) is much larger than any long-term trends observed to date.

2.3.2.3 Sea level
Global sea level is estimated to have already risen by 19 cm between 1901 and 2010 (Church et al. 2013). Estimates from reconstructed sea-level data (which include both satellite and tide gauge observations) indicate that global average sea level has been rising at about 1.7 ± 0.2 mm/year since 1900, and at about 1.9 ± 0.4 mm/year since 1960. From the satellite record, global average sea level has been rising at 3.2 ± 0.4 mm/year since 1993, indicating an acceleration in the rate of rise (Church et al. 2013). It is now possible to confidently apportion observed global sea-level rise to its various components. Since the 1970s most sea-level rise has been due to thermal expansion of the ocean (i.e. warming) and the melting of glaciers (excluding Antarctica), with greater contributions from melting of Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets in the last two decades (Church et al. 2013). In addition, since 1993, the rate of sea-level rise in the western Pacific and eastern Indian Oceans has been about three times faster than the global average (Church et al. 2006; Becker et al. 2012). This recent higher rate of regional sea-level rise is primarily a consequence of natural decadal variability (superimposed upon the global rise) associated with the IPO/PDO shifting from a positive to negative phase and an associated intensification of the Trade Winds across the tropical Pacific Ocean (Australian Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO 2011; Merrifield et al. 2012; England et al. 2014). Time series of annual sea level at selected Pacific stations (Figure 2.15) all show high interannual variability superimposed on the general rising trend. Many of the extreme years also reflect modulation of sea level by ENSO events, for example, 1997/1998 (Table 2.3).
In summary, climate records from Pacific Islands show clear evidence of long-term regional warming of air temperatures consistent with anthropogenic climate change. Sea level also shows a general rising trend but also exhibits substantial interannual to decadal variability. In particular, western tropical Pacific sea level has risen much faster than the global average. This, however, is likely to be strongly influenced by natural decadal variability associated with the IPO/PDO. Rainfall trends are much less coherent and generally characterised by high interannual variability largely attributable to ENSO and IPO/PDO phase. These results illustrate the complexity of determining long-term climate trends (especially for rainfall) in the tropical Pacific where natural sources of interannual and decadal variability play a significant role in modulating surface climate and where long-term observational time series are limited.
2.3.4 Extreme temperatures and rainfall
While it is important to understand changes in the average climate of a region, it is often extreme events (e.g. droughts, floods, unusually hot conditions) that have the greatest impacts on societies and the natural and managed systems they rely on. As average temperatures have increased (Figures 2.11, 2.12), we have seen more warm days and nights (with temperatures exceeding the 90th percentile), and fewer cool days and nights (with temperatures below the 10th percentile) over the last 60 years (Manton et
72

CHAPTER 2
al. 2001; Griffiths et al. 2005; Figure 2.16). Averaged across the region, the frequency of warm days and warm nights has increased four-fold over the period 1951–2011. Once rare extremes, occurring ~20 days per year, are now happening much more frequently (up to 80 days per year). Changes in the number of cool nights and cool days are equally dramatic, becoming much rarer in the last decade (Whan et al. 2013). In contrast to temperature extremes, there have been few spatially consistent trends in extreme rainfall since 1961. For most extreme indices, few of the station trends are statistically significant. As with total rainfall, extreme rainfall is strongly modulated by ENSO events (Table 2.3) and the IPO/PDO (Manton et al. 2001; Griffiths et al. 2003; McGree et al. 2013). Thus, any underlying trends resulting from anthropogenic warming are masked by this high natural variability, as are trends in drought or flood frequency or rainfall intensity.

CHAPTER 2
2.3.5 Tropical cyclones
Assessing changes in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones is difficult as they rarely approach observing stations and it is only since satellite observing systems became operational in the 1980s that all significant tropical cyclones can be identified (Kuleshov 2012). Thus, it is hard to draw any firm conclusions as to whether we have seen significant trends in recent decades in either tropical cyclone frequency or intensity (Knutson et al. 2010). Analysis of tropical cyclone best track data for the South Pacific from 1981–1982 through 2010–2011 (Kuleshov et al. 2010, 2013) shows a slight decrease in the total number of cyclones (minimum central pressure < 995 hPa) and severe cyclones (< 970 hPa), with little change in the numbers of the most intense cyclones (< 950 hPa) (Figure 2.17). The small downward trends are not, however, statistically significant.
2.4 Projected changes in surface climate: possible futures?
We now examine possible climate change under scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions through the 21st century. We can make projections of how typical weather conditions (i.e. climate) are likely to respond to external factors, some of which can be plausibly estimated far into the future. External factors include changes to the output from the sun, atmospheric aerosols from volcanic eruptions and changes in the composition of the atmosphere due to human activities. The major driver of climate change in recent decades has been the increase in atmospheric concentrations of longlived greenhouse gases and changes in anthropogenic aerosols. Human emissions of greenhouse gases are expected to continue to dominate and become stronger over the next century and beyond (Stocker et al. 2013).
As we cannot be certain what future greenhouse gases and anthropogenic aerosol emissions will be, projections of future climate use a scenario approach. This involves a set of hypothetical, but plausible, scenarios of human emissions (RCPs) and estimations of the response of the climate system for each. These scenarios are then fed into Global Climate Models (GCMs). There are many climate models developed by various modelling centres around the world, and no individual model is considered the single best as each has different strengths and weaknesses. The use of multiple models to form an ‘ensemble’ is an integral part of making climate projections. The spread in projections across different models provides us with a measure of certainty about different aspects of climate change. If different models agree on the sign and magnitude of a projected change, this gives us confidence in that projection, while if equally acceptable models show conflicting results we have lower confidence. Multiple models are also important for isolating the climate change signal from natural climate variability. Typically, current GCMs have a horizontal resolution of ~60–300 km, as higher resolution modelling over several decades is precluded by computational costs. Hence regional-scale features of island climates may be lost.

CHAPTER 2
77

Models always contain some consistent differences to the observed climate, known as bias. Some bias is expected and does not invalidate the model projection, but large biases are a problem if they are likely to influence the projected change signal that the model produces. The Pacific Ocean is one of the most challenging regions for GCMs to realistically simulate and many models contain biases in this region. In general, the CMIP5 models show some incremental improvements in their simulation of Pacific climate over CMIP3. Despite these improvements, CMIP5 models retain many of the same systematic model biases present in CMIP3. These include a bias in the strength and position of the equatorial cold tongue, the WPWP, the position and orientation of the SPCZ and ITCZ, the WPM (Figure 2.5), and the simulation of ENSO events. Nevertheless, climate models are still the best tools we have to understand the processes and features involved in the climate system of the Pacific and their response to increased greenhouse gases (Irving et al. 2011; Perkins et al. 2012). Here we use a set of projections from up to 26 CMIP5 GCMs assessed for their ability to simulate tropical Pacific climate (Grose et al. 2014; Australian Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO, 2014), in addition to some multi-model projections of IPCC-AR5 (Collins et al. 2013; Flato et al. 2013; Kirtman et al. 2013). Projections are for 20-year periods centred on 2030 (2020–2040), 2050 (2040–2060) and 2090 (2080–2100) relative to 1986–2005.

Confidence in model projections is higher where:

yy models have low biases in the simulation of the present climate in the region of interest;
yy models reproduce recent trends evident in observational data that are attributable to anthropogenic forcing;
yy processes driving future change are understood and appear plausible; and
yy models agree on the future change.
For many results we can assign a confidence rating following the IPCC guidelines on uncertainty (Mastrandrea et al. 2010). This involves examining the type, amount, quality and consistency of evidence and the agreement between those lines of evidence, and assigning a rating from very low to very high (noted in italics).

CHAPTER 2
2.4.1 Climate features The major climate features of the tropical Pacific (Figures 2.5 2.6) influence the regional pattern and seasonal cycle for rainfall, winds, tropical cyclones, ocean currents and many other aspects of the environment (Section 2.2). In addition, ENSO plays a central role in the year-to-year variability and the PDO introduces decadal variability in the climate of the tropical Pacific (Section 2.3.1.1).
Figure 2.16 Trends in the number (events per decade) of warm days (top left), warm nights (top right), cool days (bottom left) and cool nights (bottom right), 1961–2011. Red indicates warming trends and blue indicates cooling trends. Red triangles depict positive trends in the upper panels (i.e. more warm days or more warm nights) and negative trends in the lower panels (i.e. fewer cool days or fewer cool nights). Filled triangles indicate trend is statistically significant at the 5% level. ‘Warm’ days and nights exceed the 90th percentile while ‘cool’ days and nights are below the 10th percentile (see www.bom.gov.au/climate/ pccsp/about-pi-extreme-indices.shtml) (from Whan et al. 2013). Virtually all climate models simulate a future increase in rainfall along the equator associated with regionally-enhanced warming of SST. Interpretation of this change in the western Pacific is complicated by the ‘cold tongue bias’ that exists in most models (where SST is too cool along the equator in the current climate). Most models project an increase in rainfall within the ITCZ, especially in the May–October season.
79

Although there is uncertainty in the projection of rainfall in the SPCZ region, many models project an increase in rainfall in the SPCZ and a reduction in rainfall to the east of the SPCZ under a strong warming scenario of >3°C (Widlansky et al. 2012). There is a lack of model agreement regarding the projected change in the orientation or mean latitude of the SPCZ, but most models show a contraction of the eastern edge of the SPCZ due to a strengthening of the southeast Pacific Trade Winds (Brown et al. 2012). Both CMIP3 and CMIP5 models indicate more extreme swings in the location of the SPCZ are likely in a warmer climate (Cai et al. 2012). There is also a general tendency for an enhancement of the seasonal cycle of rainfall in the WPM region.
Figure 2.17 Annual number of tropical cyclones in the South Pacific Ocean, 1981–82 to 2010–11 for a) total number, b) severe tropical cyclones <970 hPa, and c) intense tropical cyclones <950 hPa. Linear trend lines also shown though none are statistically significant (adapted from Kuleshov et al. 2010). A systematic change in the frequency, intensity or pattern of El Niño and La Niña events would have important impacts on average rainfall, rainfall variability, wet and dry extremes, tropical cyclones and sea levels (Tables 2.2, 2.3). Unfortunately, climate models do not yet provide consistent projections of the future of ENSO events (Vecchi and Wittenberg 2010; Guilyardi et al. 2012) but they are very likely to continue as the major source of interannual Pacific climate variability (Christensen et al. 2013). Future El Niño and La Niña events will, however, tend to be warmer than in the past and rainfall variability associated with ENSO events is likely to become amplified. This means that areas that are typically wetter (drier) during an ENSO event, will become even wetter (drier) for an ENSO of equivalent magnitude in the future (Christensen et al. 2013; Power et al. 2013). There is, however, low confidence as to how Pacific decadal climate variability may change in the future (Christensen et al. 2013).
80

CHAPTER 2
2.4.2 Temperature There is very high confidence that average temperatures will increase, bringing more hot days and warm nights and fewer cool days and nights. There is a slightly wider range across CMIP5 projections compared with CMIP3, mainly due to the larger range in the RCP emissions scenarios compared with previous SRES scenarios (Figure 2.3). Projected changes in island air temperatures in the tropical Pacific are lower than for large land masses, as air temperatures for PICTs are primarily controlled by SSTs, which warm more slowly than temperatures over land. There is little spatial variation in the pattern of warming across the Pacific so no map is shown. By 2030, projected warming in all Pacific countries is +0.5o to 1.0o C regardless of the emissions scenario (Table 2.4). This projected warming is in addition to the warming already observed to date (Section 2.3.2.1). Beyond 2030 there is a growing difference in the magnitude of temperature changes between different scenarios. These differences are most strongly evident by the end of the 21st century with maximum projected warming of 2.0o to 4.0o C with RCP8.5.

Observed temperature anomalies (Goddard Institute for Space Studies, GISS) from the base period 1986–2005 are shown in red with dashed black lines showing the 5–95th percentiles. The orange and blue lines show the 20-year running average multi-model mean anomaly for RCP8.5 and RCP2.6, respectively. Shading represents the 5–95th percentile spread of model values. Boxes to the right show the range of temperature changes for all four RCPs by 2090 (source: Australian Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO, 2014; Hansen et al. 2010). Example temperature time series for western Kiribati and southern Cook Islands (Figure 2.18) illustrate average temperature change under the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios and the observed record. The series show the similarity of the scenarios until about 2030, then the growing difference between them towards the end of the century.

CHAPTER 2
2.4.3 Rainfall There is a combination of thermodynamic influences (the ‘wet get wetter’ mechanism) whereby rainfall changes are driven by changes in atmospheric moisture content and dynamic influences (the ‘warmer get wetter’ mechanism), whereby rainfall changes are driven by changes in atmospheric circulation, that contribute to net rainfall change in the tropics (Xie et al. 2010; Chadwick et al. 2013; Widlansky et al. 2013). It has been suggested that a ‘warmer get wetter’ mechanism dominates the projection of mean annual rainfall along the equator, while the ‘wet get wetter’ mechanism is important for changes in seasonal rainfall and particularly an increase in rainfall in the high rainfall region in the wet season of each hemisphere (Huang et al. 2013). This is consistent with the general tendency in many tropical locations for the wet season to get wetter and the dry season to get drier (Biasutti 2013). While these general principles appear robust, there are many factors that affect rainfall projections for any location and model biases affect the precision of projections. As a result, confidence in regional rainfall projections is generally only low to medium and lower than for temperature. For example, model bias in the location of the SPCZ affects the interpretation of rainfall changes in those PICTs influenced by the SPCZ, particularly those situated at its edge. Also, topography can result in markedly different total rainfall across islands; for example, the west and east coasts of Vanuatu (Section 2.2.1). This is a problem when it comes to projecting rainfall changes, as the relatively low-resolution GCMs are unable to capture these important fine-scale details. As a result, these models cannot differentiate local changes in rainfall (e.g. from one side of an island to another); they only tell us about broad-scale changes.
Figure 2.20 Historical and projected rainfall for the region surrounding a) the Phoenix Island group in eastern Kiribati, and b) Fiji. Observed rainfall anomalies (Global Precipitation Climatology Project, GPCP) from the base period 1986–2005 are shown in red with black lines showing the 5–95th percentiles. The orange and blue lines show the 20-year running average multi-model mean anomaly for RCP8.5 and RCP2.6, respectively. Shading represents the 5–95th percentile spread of model values. Boxes to the right show the range of rainfall changes for all four RCPs by 2090 (source: Australian Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO, 2014; Adler et al. 2003).
83

Average annual rainfall is projected to increase over large parts of the tropical Pacific in a warmer climate. The effect of warming is likely to be small up to 2030 and mostly obscured by natural climate variability (Section 2.3.1). After 2030, distinctive patterns emerge that become progressively stronger for higher emissions scenarios (RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) and with time. To illustrate the pattern at its strongest, changes under RCP8.5 from 1986–2005 and 2080–2099 are shown in Figure 2.19a. The equivalent for RCP4.5 (Figure 2.19b), shows similar spatial patterns but smaller changes (Table 2.5). Percentage change in rainfall should be interpreted in the context of the current baseline (Figure 2.19c). During November–April, large percentage increases in rainfall are projected along the equator, in the northeast near the Marshall Islands and in the middle of the SPCZ region, with decreases at the northeastern edge of the SPCZ near the Cook Islands and the southeastern Pacific subtropics (Figure 2.19a, b left side). During May–October, large percentage increases in rainfall are also projected along the equator and the northwest around Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia with small changes in the multi-model mean south of the equator (Figure 2.19a, b right side). Projected rainfall increases in the west around Papua New Guinea, parts of the Solomon Islands, Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia occur on top of high current rainfall and thus represent large absolute changes in rainfall.
Figure 2.21 Projected sea-level change (cm), RCP4.5, for 2081–2100 relative to 1986–2005 indicated by shading, with the uncertainty indicated by contours. Sea-level changes are estimated by combining global average sea-level projections, the dynamic ocean departure from the global average and the regional changes associated with the changing mass distribution in the cryosphere (Australian Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO, 2014).
84

CHAPTER 2
Example rainfall time series for eastern Kiribati and Fiji (Figure 2.20) illustrate average rainfall changes under the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios and the observed record. The Phoenix group in eastern Kiribati is within the region of projected rainfall increase along the equator (Figure 2.19), and this is reflected in the time series where multi-model mean rainfall steadily increases through the century. The increase is larger for the higher emissions scenarios and although there is a large spread in the magnitude of projected rainfall change between models, all indicate an increase in rainfall by the end of the 21st century. The spread is considerably larger for the highest emissions (RCP8.5) scenario. This suggests that while we can be confident of a projected increase in rainfall, the magnitude of change is still quite uncertain. In contrast, in Fiji the large model spread includes some models projecting a decrease and some an increase in rainfall. This is a reflection of the uncertainty in projections of the SPCZ and other processes in the region (Table 2.5) and as such we have low confidence in how rainfall will change in Fiji.
2.4.4 Sea level There has been considerable progress in understanding past and possible future sea-level changes since the last IPCC assessment (Meehl et al. 2007b). As a result of improved modelling, there is also greater confidence in future sea-level projections due to improved constraints on thermal expansion and ice sheet changes (Church et al. 2013). As noted for temperature and rainfall projections, mid-century values for sea-level rise are similar across the different scenarios (Table 2.6) with median values 24–30 cm higher than 1986–2005. Differences amongst the scenarios are more marked by the end of the 21st century with the most extreme (RCP8.5) associated with sea levels 45–82 cm higher than the recent base period. This is in addition to the 19 cm rise observed over the 20th century (Church et al. 2013).
All PICTs can, therefore, anticipate sea levels at the end of the 21st century that are higher than present with a total projected range of 26 cm (lower bound of RCP2.6) up to 82 cm (upper bound for RCP8.5). For comparison, global sea-level rise for 2090–2099 relative to 1980–1999 reported in IPCC-AR4 (Meehl et al. 2007b), had a lower bound of 18 cm (SRES B1) and an upper bound of 59 cm (SRES A1F1). Thus, the most recent assessment of the magnitude of global sea-level rise is substantially higher than that of previous IPCC assessments.

Regional variations in sea-level rise will occur, related to changes in ocean heat content, surface winds, ocean currents and to the gravitational effect of melting ice sheets. However, these variations are likely to fall within 20% of the global average sea-level change. In addition, on decadal timescales, substantial regional changes can be driven by natural variability related, for example, to the PDO/IPO (Section 2.3.2.3). As such, we would expect sea level to vacillate above and below any mean projected change as a result of natural variability. Sea level is projected to rise throughout the tropical Pacific but with slightly higher rates north of ~10oN and in the southwest Pacific. Slightly lower rates of rise are projected between ~ 10oN and 20oS. These differences in relative rates of sea-level rise are, however, small at ~5-6 cm (Figure 2.21).

The effect of sea-level rise is most strongly felt in changes to extreme sea-level events. For example, a 50 cm increase in mean sea level (which corresponds to the low end of RCP8.5 projections for the coming century) can dramatically increase the frequency of sea level exceeding a given threshold (Hunter 2012). Over the western Pacific increases of two orders of magnitude or more have been suggested (i.e. with a 50 cm sea-level increase a 1-in-100 year flooding event would typically occur every year).
Without concerted greenhouse gas mitigation, much larger sea-level rise is likely over multi-centennial timescales. It is thought that Greenland could reach a tipping point when global average temperatures warm by ~2o-4o C. If this threshold were reached, potentially irreversible melting of the Greenland ice sheet would increase global sea level by ~7 m over millennium timescales (Church et al. 2013).

2.4.5 Wind speed
Projected changes in average surface wind speeds are generally small. Wind speeds are projected to decrease near and to the north of the equator, consistent with atmospheric circulation changes such as the slowing of the Walker Circulation. Surface wind speeds are projected to increase in some regions of the south Pacific, linked to a strengthening of the southeasterly Trade Winds.

2.4.6 Cloud cover and solar radiation

Projected changes to cloud cover and solar radiation broadly follow that of rainfall. In most places there is an increase in cloud cover and a decrease in radiation at the surface consistent with the increase in rainfall (Section 2.4.3). Projected changes are, however, fairly small, with changes in surface radiation <10% under any scenario by the end of the century. Despite slight decreases in radiation, potential evaporation is projected to increase in a warmer climate, driven by warming temperature.
