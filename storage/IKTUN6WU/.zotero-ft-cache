I wanted to find pages on the University of Guam College of Natural and Life Sciences Web Site containing a specific string. This short python script, which uses the scrapy framework, does the trick:
test_spider.py

  from  scrapy.spiders  import  CrawlSpider ,  Rule 
from  scrapy.contrib.linkextractors  import  LinkExtractor 

class  someSpider ( CrawlSpider ): 
  name  =  'crawltest' 
  allowed_domains  =  [ 'cnas-re.uog.edu' ] 
  start_urls  =  [ 'http://cnas-re.uog.edu' ] 
  rules  =  (  Rule ( LinkExtractor ( allow = ()),  follow = True , callback = 'parse_item' ),  ) 

  def  parse_item ( self ,  response ): 
    target  =  'bell pepper' 
    log  =  'test_spider_log.md' 
    if  target  in  str ( response . body ): 
      with  open ( log ,  'a' )  as  f : 
        f . write ( '**{} was found in <{}> \n ' . format ( target ,  response . url )) 
    return 

Executed from the command line using:

  scrapy runspider test_spider.py -s DEPTH_LIMIT = 2

Output: test_spider_log.md

bell pepper was found in http://cnas-re.uog.edu/soils-of-guam/

bell pepper was found in http://cnas-re.uog.edu/cnas-publications/?auth=&limit=17&tgid=&type=&usr=&yr=

bell pepper was found in http://cnas-re.uog.edu/cnas-publications/?auth=&tgid=115&type=&usr=&yr=

bell pepper was found in http://cnas-re.uog.edu/cnas-publications/?auth=&tgid=66&type=&usr=&yr=

    python scrapy
