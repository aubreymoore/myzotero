Abstract
The lobate lac scale Paratachardina pseudolobata Kondo & Gullan (Kerriidae) is a polyphagous pest of woody plants in Florida (U.S.A.) the Bahamas, Christmas Island (Australia) and it has been reported from Cuba. Its recent appearance as a pest in these places indicates that this scale is introduced; however, its native range is unknown. Until 2006, this pest species was identiﬁed mistakenly as Paratachardina lobata (Chamberlin) [now P. silvestri (Mahdihassan)], which is native to India and Sri Lanka. Quarantine laboratory acceptance trials with Indian P. silvestri parasitoids indicated a strong immune response from P. pseudolobata. Gregarious development of encyrtid wasps was the only observed parasitism, but parasitization levels were below 3%. Identiﬁcation of the native range of P. pseudolobata would facilitate the search for natural enemies better adapted to the scale. Sequence data from the D2–D3 region of the nuclear large subunit ribosomal RNA gene (LSU rRNA, 28S) and the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I (COI) distinguished P. pseudolobata from the morphologically similar species P. silvestri and P. mahdihassani Kondo & Gullan, and showed P. pseudolobata to be more closely related to these Indotropical species than to an Australian species of Paratachardina Balachowsky. Paratachardina pseudolobata was genetically uniform throughout its exotic range, consistent with a single geographic origin, although lack of variation in these genes is not unusual for scale insects. Molecular identiﬁcation of morphologically similar Paratachardina species was possible using the D2–D3 region of 28S, despite its length variation, suggesting that this gene region might be suitable as a non-COI barcoding gene for scale insects.

1. Introduction
The lobate lac scale, a serious plant pest, was ﬁrst detected in the Bahamas in 1992 and later in South Florida, in Broward County in 1999 and in Miami Dade County in

2000, where it built up alarming densities in the following two years (Howard and Pemberton, 2003; Pemberton, 2003a). The invasive pest was identiﬁed mistakenly as Paratachardina lobata Chamberlin [now a junior synonym of P. silvestri (Mahdihassan)] in all literature until the taxonomic revision of the genus Paratachardina Balachowsky by Kondo and Gullan (2007), in which it was described as a new species, Paratachardina pseudolobata Kondo and Gullan. This pest is highly polyphagous: over 300 plant species in 58 diﬀerent families, including native plants and cultivated fruit trees and ornamentals, are attacked by

the invasive scale in southern Florida (Howard et al., 2006). Due to the lack of natural enemies, the scale increased and spread quickly in Florida and the Bahamas and has a high potential to spread in the Caribbean and elsewhere (Pemberton, 2003b). The scale was reported from the territory of Christmas Island, Australia (Kondo and Gullan, 2007; Abbott and Green, 2007), where it is a pest of carambola (Averrhoa carambola L.) and other plants (Pemberton, unpublished). Recently it was recorded in Cuba for the ﬁrst time (Mestre et al., 2006). Eﬃcient natural enemies are needed urgently to control the scale’s damage and to limit its spread. Thus identifying the native range of this scale insect is a necessary ﬁrst step. A biological control research program against the lobate lac scale was initiated in 2003 (Pemberton, 2003b). The ﬁrst approach was to collect parasitoids from the con-familial and commercially reared Kerria lacca (Kerr), which is host to some parasitoid species known to attack Paratachardina species (Varshney, 1976; Pemberton, 2003b). Three chalcidoid species recorded as parasitizing both K. lacca and P. lobata (now P. silvestri) were collected from K. lacca in Thailand and exposed to P. pseudolobata in the USDA, ARS Invasive Plant Research quarantine facility in Florida, but the wasps failed to parasitize the lobate lac scales (Pemberton et al., 2006).
The second approach was to search for the lobate lac scale and its natural enemies in its native range. The search began in India, because the lobate lac scale was previously identiﬁed as P. lobata, which was known to be native to southern India and Sri Lanka (Varshney, 1977). Robert Pemberton and P. Selvaraj located kerriid scales in India in 2005 at 14 sites. Living kerriid specimens were sent to the USDA, ARS Invasive Plant Research quarantine facility (Schroer et al., 2007). The scales from India were understood to be P. lobata as was the target pest in Florida. The Indian material was subsequently identiﬁed as P. silvestri and P. mahdihassani Kondo and Gullan, and the Florida pest as P. pseudolobata (Kondo and Gullan, 2007). Three primary parasitoids of P. silvestri and P. mahdihassani were isolated, and exposed to P. pseudolobata cultures reared from Florida collections. Despite the observed oviposition, only a few individual wasps were able to develop in lobate lac scales. Most parasitoid eggs were encapsulated by the host, indicating that the parasitoids are not well adapted to lobate lac scale (Schroer and Pemberton, 2007). Parasitoids that have evolved with particular hosts overcome the speciﬁc defensive reactions of their hosts, either by avoiding tissue with strong immune reactions or diminishing the chemical reactions with speciﬁc venoms or by abilities to disguise the alien tissue (Strand and Pech, 1995).
The apparent mismatch between the parasitoids and the lobate lac scale suggested that the Indian host of the parasitoids and the lobate lac in Florida (both identiﬁed as P. lobata prior to the taxonomic work of Kondo and Gullan (2007)) might be diﬀerent species or biotypes. Kondo and Gullan (2007) re-examined the morphology of the invasive lobate lac scale from Florida, the Bahamas and Christmas

Island, as well as other Paratachardina specimens from museum collections and recent Indian collections. They revised the taxonomy of the genus and determined that the lobate lac scale represented a distinct species on the basis of morphological comparisons. The speciﬁc name ‘‘pseudolobata” was coined in reference to the species with which it had been confused.
For the present study, specimens of P. pseudolobata from Florida and the Bahamas were collected to document levels of scale infestation and to record the presence of any parasitoids. Specimens from Florida, the Bahamas, Cuba and Christmas Island were obtained for molecular analysis to estimate the genetic diversity of the populations. We also used DNA sequence data to test the species status of P. pseudolobata and to place it in a phylogenetic context by comparison with other species of Paratachardina and with other genera of Kerriidae. Knowledge of the relationship of P. pseudolobata to other members of Paratachardina could narrow the search for the native range of the lobate lac scale based on the known distribution of its closest relatives, as done for the pestiferous Chinese wax scale (Qin et al., 1994). In contrast to the morphologically similar P. silvestri, the lobate lac scale is exclusively parthenogenetic (Pemberton, 2003a; Howard et al, 2006; Kondo and Gullan, 2007). We could expect that if the populations of P. pseudolobata originated from a single geographic region, or represent a single origin of an invasive form, there should be low (possibly zero) genetic variation within pest populations and among diﬀerent geographical regions of its invasive range (e.g. Downie, 2002; Scheﬀer and Grissell, 2003; Grapputo et al., 2005). This study also provides the opportunity to evaluate the two genes used here for their usefulness as non-COI barcode regions for molecular identiﬁcation of scale insects. To date, the typical DNA barcode region (50 region of CO1 (Herbert et al., 2003)) has not been reliably or successfully ampliﬁed for scale insects using universal or modiﬁed primers. Therefore, alternative barcode regions need to be explored. To be useful as a DNA barcode, a region needs to be easily and reliably ampliﬁed for the group of interest with universal primers, and to readily distinguish among species.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Specimen collections
Specimens were obtained from as many populations and species of Paratachardina as possible (Table 1). Specimens of P. pseudolobata were collected from Florida, three islands of the Bahamas, Christmas Island (Australia) and Cuba. Specimens of other Paratachardina species, including P. silvestri and P. mahdihassani were obtained from several localities in India. Also, because the monophyly of Paratachardina has not been tested and the relationships within the genus are uncertain, sampling included an Australian species of Paratachardina and other lac scales from

Australia and Africa, which served as outgroups for phylogenetic analysis (Table 1).
For the lobate lac scale and the Indian Paratachardina species, infested twig segments were clipped from the plants and samples of about 10–30 specimens were stored in each of 70% and 95% ethanol for transportation to the Department of Entomology, UC Davis. Specimens of P. silvestri and P. mahdihassani were taken from shipments sent bimonthly from 14 sites in southern India from August 2005 until July 2006 (Schroer et al., 2007). Lobate lac scales from Christmas Island were provided by Dennis O’Dowd (Monash University, Australia) and Mick Jeﬀery (Parks Australia North, Christmas Island), from Cuba by Horacio Grillo Ravelo (Universidad Central de Las Villas, Cuba). In Florida, P. pseudolobata was collected at 12 sites. The sites were selected from a list of lobate lac scale collection localities provided by Greg Hodges (Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Gainesville, FL). In the Bahamas, P. pseudolobata specimens were collected from three islands: Grand Bahamas, New Providence and Andros.
The density of P. pseudolobata infestations in Florida and the Bahamas was determined per plant with the highest infestation at each site, by estimating the number of lobate lac scales per 30 cm of three randomly chosen twig segments with 620 mm cross-section. Infestations of 610 female scales were rated as low, P11–100 as medium, and >100 as high (Pemberton, 2003a). From each collection site, scales on 30 cm twig segments with highest infestation were examined for the presence of parasitoid emergence holes. The percentage parasitization was determined by counting the number of emergence holes relative to the number of scales. Data were compared using one tailed Mann–Whitney U test for two independent samples. Due to the low percentage of parasitization we did not arcsine transform these data; signiﬁcant levels were at 5%. If the tests had emergence holes, the specimens were removed and preserved in ethanol, and remains of parasitoids inside the scales were studied under the dissecting microscope.

Identiﬁcations and morphological observations of all Kerriidae available for this study were made from adult females mounted on microscope slides and examined under a compound microscope. Specimens were slide-mounted in Canada balsam using the method described in Williams and Granara de Willink (1992), except that xylene was used instead of clove oil. Specimens intended for molecular work were preserved in 95–100% ethanol and stored below 4 °C. After DNA extraction, these specimens were slidemounted as vouchers. All vouchers of Paratachardina species are deposited in the Bohart Museum of Entomology (BME), University of California, Davis, USA, although other specimens from these same collections are deposited in a range of institutions (Kondo and Gullan, 2007).

3. Results

2.3. Molecular comparisons
DNA was extracted from whole, ethanol-preserved adult female specimens using a DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The cuticle of each adult female was recovered after the ﬁrst incubation step and stored in 70% ethanol until being slide-mounted. Two partial gene regions were ampliﬁed; the 30 region of the mitochondrial protein-encoding gene cytochrome oxidase I (COI) was ampliﬁed with an annealing temperature of 50 °C using CI-J-2183 (Jerry) (Simon et al., 1994) and C1-N-2568 (Ben) (Brady et al., 2000), and the D2–D3 region of the nuclear large-subunit ribosomal RNA gene (28S) was ampliﬁed with an annealing temperature of 55 °C using primers S3660 (28SF, Dowton and Austin, 1998) and A335 (28Sb, Whiting et al., 1997). The COI barcode region (Herbert et al., 2003) was not used because it has failed to amplify in most scale insects tried to date, including lac scales. Puriﬁed PCR products were sequenced in both the forward and reverse directions at the UC Davis genomics facility (CGF, UC Davis) or by Macrogen Ltd. (Korea).
Contigs were assembled and manually edited using Sequencher v4.5 (Gibbs and Cockerill, 1995; GeneCodes) and aligned by eye using Se–Al (Rambaut, 1996). Phylogenetic analyses and genetic distance measures were undertaken using PAUP* (Swoﬀord, 2003). Genetic distance measures were calculated using the Kimura-2 parameter option. Length variation in the D2–D3 region of 28S among lac scale taxa resulted in regions of ambiguous alignment. These regions were excluded from analyses that included sampling across the whole of Kerriidae. There was less length variation within Paratachardina, resulting in a less ambiguous alignment, so all sites were included in a reduced-taxon, Paratachardina-only analysis. Two diﬀerent weighting schemes were applied in maximum parsimony analysis (MP) of the COI data: equally-weighted (ewt MP, all sites weighted equally) and diﬀerentially-weighted (dwt MP, in which ﬁrst and second codon positions were weighted three times that of third codon positions).
For a gene region to be of use as a DNA barcode, an unknown sample needs to be reliably and conﬁdently matched to a known sample, typically using a phylogenetic approach such as neighbor-joining. Length variation among samples has the potential to mislead analyses if the phylogenetic result is sensitive to alignment. To test the utility of 28S, despite its length variation within scale insects, an automated alignment program (MUSCLE, Edgar, 2004) was used to determine whether the species clusters could be recovered using a default ambiguous alignment of the whole of the D2–D3 region. The MUS-

3.1. Colonization and parasitism
In southern Florida most sampled host plants were heavily infested with P. pseudolobata. Infested plants were found over the entire southern peninsula from the east to the west coast between latitudes 25°000N to 27°460N, including seven counties. In Miami-Dade and Broward Counties susceptible plants were infested with >500 scales per 30 cm. Wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera) and redberry stopper (Eugenia confusa) were among the most susceptible plants to P. pseudolobata in Florida and usually were the ﬁrst infested plant species at newly invaded sites. At the most northern site in Florida and the most eastern site on Andros Island, these two plant species had infestation levels of >300 scales per 30 cm. In the three islands of the Bahamas, the infestation was lower than in Florida, but occasional very high infestations were recorded (e.g., >400 adult scales per 30 cm were counted on a redberry stopper on Grand Bahamas Island). Plants infested to a medium level were found throughout the observed islands. Table 2 presents the infestation levels and the number of scales found with parasitoid emergence holes at all collection sites in the Bahamas and Florida.
The parasitization level of P. pseudolobata was very low. In the Bahamas only 2.29% (±3.31) scales (n = 2557 scales) were parasitized. and even less 0.22% (±0.37) were parasitized in southern Florida (n = 10860 scales), (Mann–Whitney Test, P = 0.23). Fully developed adults of Metaphycus spp. and Ooencyrtus sp. (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) were found inside scales both in Florida and the Bahamas. A Metaphycus male and female were found inside a single scale on the Bahamas, and two males and one female were collected in Florida. Only males were found of Ooencyrtus, two on the Bahamas and one in Florida. All collected parasitoids developed gregariously with two to four siblings as indicated by the number of emergence holes and parasitoid remains found in the scales.
3.2. Morphological characteristics
Morphologically, P. pseudolobata is similar to two Indian species, P. mahdihassani and P. silvestri (Kondo and Gullan, 2007). In each of these three species, the test of the adult female is resinous and four-lobed. In the other species of Paratachardina, the test of the adult female is more globular and has up to 16 ridges radiating from the top center of the test towards the venter, giving a ribbed appearance. The morphology of adult females of all Paratachardina species is quite similar in structure and reliable identiﬁcation requires well-prepared microscope slide-mounts. The most important features for distinguish-

The relationships among P. pseudolobata, P. silvestri and P. mahdihassani diﬀered among analyses. In dwt MP analysis of COI (Fig. 1), and in the Paratachardina-only analysis of 28S (Fig. 3), P. silvestri and P. mahdihassani were

sister taxa. In the conserved region-only analysis of 28S, P. silvestri was sister to P. pseudolobata, whereas in the ewt MP analysis of COI P. mahdihassani was sister to P. pseudolobata. The NJ analysis of the MUSCLE alignment of 28S recovered all species, with each multiply-sampled species of Paratachardina receiving bootstrap values of 100.

Fig. 2. Phylogenetic relationships of the lac scales (Kerriidae) based on maximum parsimony analysis of the conserved regions of the D2–D3 domains of 28S. Bootstrap support from 1000 pseudoreplicates is shown above internodes. The specimen code and collection locality are shown after each species name. CI, Christmas Island (Australia).

More variation was found within and among taxa in 28S than in COI (Figs. 1 and 2). The length of the ampliﬁed D2-D3 region of 28S varied more than 30% among the kerriid specimens (748–1114 bp). There was 11% divergence in 28S between P. pseudolobata and P. mahdihassani, and 12% between P. pseudolobata and P. silvestri. Paratachardina sp. near decorella (TK0415) was the only individual displaying variation in 28S, with 5 polymorphic sites. At each polymorphic site, both peaks of the electropherogram were of equal intensity. There were both length variation and substitutions among individuals of P. silvestri from diﬀerent localities, with 9 substitutions separating TK0410 from the other two populations. No variation was found within or among populations of either P. pseudolobata or P. mahdihassani.
There was no length variation in the COI region ampliﬁed and no intra-speciﬁc polymorphism (Fig. 1), but there was up to 15% diﬀerence within Paratachardina and 7–9% divergence between P. pseudolobata and its nearest relatives. There was 10% divergence in COI between P. pseudolobata and P. mahdihassani, and 8.5% between

P. pseudolobata and P. silvestri. Of the lac scale insect species compared here, only P. silvestri exhibited intra-speciﬁc variation in 28S. None were found to have intra-speciﬁc variation in COI.
4. Discussion
The level and pattern of DNA sequence divergence between P. pseudolobata and other kerriid specimens distinguishes P. pseudolobata from the morphologically most similar species P. silvestri and P. mahdihassani. Both COI and 28S clearly distinguished each of the described species of Kerriidae and resulted in clustering of individuals by species in the phylogenetic analyses (Figs. 1 and 2). COI was less variable than 28S but easier to align and with less uncertainty. 28S was more variable than COI in proportion of substitutions, presence of indels and fragment length. Scale insect 28S appears to be more diverse and length-variable than that of most other insects examined to date (e.g. Dowton and Austin, 1998; Gillespie et al., 2004). This also is the case for the more conserved 18S region, in which

scale insects also exhibit considerable length variation among taxa (Cook et al., 2002; Cook and Gullan, 2004).
Incomplete concerted evolution, or another process with a similar outcome, is apparent in the 28S sequence from P. nr decorella (TK0415), with ﬁve clear polymorphic sites in the one individual. The equal intensity of each polymorphism in the electropherogram suggests that each is present in equal copy number. This could indicate that there are two independent loci, each concertedly evolving within a locus but not across loci. Multiple copies of 28S have been reported for insects previously (e.g. Dowton and Austin, 1998; Gillespie et al., 2004) and have sometimes been attributed to multiple loci. An alternative explanation might be recent hybridization, with the TK0415 individual representing an F1-equivalent hybrid.
The combination of extreme length polymorphism among taxa and substitutional polymorphism within individuals suggests that the use of 28S as an alternative

DNA barcode region in scale insects might not be straightforward. The variation leads to greater branch length between taxa but diﬃculty in aligning sequences across diverse taxa, even within Kerriidae. This might not be a major problem if specimen identiﬁcation is the primary objective. Despite the length variation present within the kerriids included here, specimens were clustered by species with high conﬁdence (bootstraps = 100) using an automated alignment program (MUSCLE) and neighbor-joining algorithm. This suggests that 28S, despite length variation, might be a suitable non-COI barcode for scale insects.
The lack of variation among all specimens of P. pseudolobata sampled to date is consistent with a single geographic, or genotypic, origin of the scale. Given the apparent parthenogenetic nature of the populations of P. pseudolobata, it is possible that each could have been founded by as few as one female. However, the DNA

sequence data do not preclude multiple introductions or origins. Although there was no variation among individuals of P. pseudolobata from across its sampled introduced range, this is not unusual compared with other scale insects. A lack of variation among populations in the same gene regions has been found also for some other recognized species of scale insects (L.G. Cook, unpublished data). This is despite some species apparently being obligatorily sexual and having been collected from disparate localities in their native range.
No genotype was sampled from India that matched or was conspeciﬁc with P. pseudolobata, indicating that P. pseudolobata may be native to an unsampled region within India, or to another country not yet sampled. In two of the analyses (Figs. 1 and 2) it is sister to species native to India. Thus, these molecular phylogenies are uninformative as to where its native range might be, leaving the whole of Southeast Asia and Australia (the apparent natural range of the genus) as possibilities. Takumasa Kondo examined insect collections of Kasetsart University, Bangkok, and the Department of Agriculture, Bangkhen, Thailand, in 2007. Few Kerriidae were in the dry collections, none slide-mounted, and the material mostly appeared to be Kerria species. No specimens of Paratachardina were found in any collections or in ﬁeld searches.
In the conserved region-only analysis of 28S (Fig. 2), P. pseudolobata is nested within the Indian clade, suggesting this area as the possible native range. Sampling has not yet been extensive across India and Sri Lanka, and it is possible that there might be more species of Paratachardina. For instance, P. silvestri had considerable variation in 28S and the levels, up to 9 substitutions, suggest that further cryptic species may exist in this taxon. The introduction of the lobate lac scale into Florida and the Bahamas is very likely due to the importation of plants infested with this inconspicuous species. The time of the introduction of P. pseudolobata in Christmas Island is unknown. It might have been introduced with plants from Asia, where a high proportion of the human population of Christmas Island originate (Heng and Forbes, 2006). Furthermore, distribution within the New World tropical regions, particularly in the proximate West Indies, might be promoted by further movement of infested horticultural plants, as well as by wind and vectors such as wild animals and humans (Gullan and Kosztarab, 1997).
Despite the close similarity to P. silvestri and P. mahdihassani, the invasive P. pseudolobata is equipped with a different immune response. Parasitoids reared from Indian Paratachardina spp. developed successfully in P. pseudolobata only when multiple parasitoid eggs per scale were laid (Schroer and Pemberton, 2007). In Florida and the Bahamas, the same gregarious parasitoid development was observed for both the Metaphycus and Ooencyrtus spp. These parasitoid species are currently undescribed and their biology is not known; they might be local species that have shifted hosts. Similarly, Ammonoencyrtus carolinensis (Meyer) (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), a parasitoid species

that was isolated from P. pseudolobata in Florida (Schauﬀ, 2005), is known to attack the coccid Mesolecanium nigrofasciatum (Pergande) and may have shifted recently to the lobate lac insect. The parasitization levels of P. pseudolobata in the Bahamas and in Florida are very low. The slightly higher parasitization level in the Bahamas might be due to greater parasitic wasp occurrence, promoted by favorable habitats and more wild areas, untreated with pesticides. However, the parasitization levels are insuﬃcient to inﬂuence the abundance of P. pseudolobata populations in either region. Further research to investigate the origin and biology of the parasitoids and the habitats where they are most successful parasitizing the lobate lac scale are necessary for the success of future biological control strategies. This eﬀort, although challenging because the native range of P. pseudolobata is unknown, will be facilitated by the correct identiﬁcation of the pest, provided by both the morphological data (Kondo and Gullan, 2007) and the molecular research reported here.
