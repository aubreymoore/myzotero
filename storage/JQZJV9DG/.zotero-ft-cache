Research in Support of the Guam Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle Eradication Project
DRAFT: Relative Attractiveness of White and Ultraviolet Light Emitting Diodes Plus Oryctalure
Prepared by Aubrey Moore University of Guam Cooperative Extension Service January 8, 2014∗
Abstract to appear here any day now.
1 Methods
We measured the attractiveness of white light emitting diodes (LEDs) versus ultraviolet LEDs in a series of A-B selection experiments performed in two large ﬁeld cages at the University of Guam Agricultural Experiment Station at Yigo on the evenings of January 2 through 7, 2014 See ﬁgure 1for the experimental setup. We tested three types of LEDs: a white LED (W) and two ultraviolet LEDs. To human eyes, one type had a blue color (B) and the other had a violet color (V). In each cage, we ran all permutations (WB, WV, BV, BW, VW, VB) in random order on consecutive nights (Table 1). Test beetles came from pheromone traps.

Figure 1: Experimental setup. Release site (CRB adults in peat moss) in foreground. Two barrel traps equipped with pans and LEDs in background. A single oryctalure was hung between the barrels. The experiment was performed in two large ﬁeld cages (20’ x 20’ x 10’).

2 Results and Discussion
Both types of UVLEDs, when used in conjunction with oryctalure, resulted in trap catches signiﬁcantly higher than those obtained with white LEDs.There was no diﬀerence in trap catch obtained using the diﬀerent types of UVLEDs.
