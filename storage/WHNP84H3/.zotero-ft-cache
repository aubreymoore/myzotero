Introduction Hawai‘i’s urban landscapes are under a severe threat posed by a recently introduced invasive insect pest, the lobate lac scale, Paratachardina pseudolobata (Kerriidae: Coccoidea: Sternorrhyncha: Hemiptera). This plant parasite, native to India and Sri Lanka, was first discovered on a weeping banyan tree (Ficus benjamina) on O‘ahu in October 2012 by arborists participating in a tree-climbing competition at Moanalua Gardens. Since then, it has become one of the most severe plant pests in O‘ahu’s urban landscapes, attacking a wide range of plant species, including some that are endemic and endangered. This pest also poses threats to the natural areas and forests. It has not been reported on any other Hawaiian islands to date.
Mature lobate lac scales, about 2 mm long and 2 mm wide, have an x-shaped appearance and a deep maroon color. They have a hard, resinous protective armor covering their soft body underneath. The first instar measures approximately 0.4 mm in length and has a deep red color. The second instar molts to the adult stage. Development to adult from instar requires 15–19 weeks, 8–11 weeks for the first instar stage and 7–8 weeks for the second. The adults are wingless, immobile, and attached tightly on twigs. These insects disperse at the crawler stage (either first or second instar) via air currents or birds and other animals or by move-

ment of infested plants by humans. They reproduce by parthenogenesis (no mating required), as do many other scale insects, and no male has been observed (Howard et al. 2010). The lobate lac scale has a wide range of hosts, consisting of more than 300 mainly woody dicotyledonous plant species in Florida (Howard et al. 2010). The Hawai‘i Department of Agriculture (HDOA) determined in 2013 that this insect had infested at least 21 native and non-native plant species on O‘ahu, but the number of affected plant species in Hawai‘i is increasing: Our recent survey on UH-Ma¯ noa campus found over 80 infested plant species.

leaves.

The lobate lac scale infests the woody tissues of small, young twigs and branches around the thickness of a pencil and less frequently the main, older branches. Major effects on hosts include the formation of sooty molds, causing an unhealthy appearance; the dieback of twigs and branches; the thinning of foliage; and eventually the death of entire plants of some species. Infestation has not been observed on the plant leaves, petioles, or flowers. Although the lobate lac scale has a wide host range, ficus trees and hibiscus plants are highly prone to severe infestation in Hawai‘i.
Updated Host Range in Hawai‘i’s Urban Landscapes We started a survey of plants serving as hosts of the lobate lac scale at the UH-Ma¯ noa campus in April 2014. To date, we have recorded in excess of 80 host plant species belonging to 34 families. The list includes 15 plant species native to Hawai‘i and four endangered plant species. Some of the plant families, such as Moraceae, Fabaceae, Malvaceae, and Myrtaceae, are more susceptible, as indicated by the high number of infested species in these families. In our survey, a plant species was considered a host of lobate lac scale if at least one mature female were present on the plant (Howard et al. 2006). In reality, we always observed multiple adults and crawlers on the host plants identified in our survey. To identify plants to genus and species, we mainly referred to the interactive online plant map tool maintained by UH Landscaping (http:// manoa.hawaii.edu/landscaping/plantmap.html). We also consulted UH Landscaping personnel and other

experts as needed. Table 1 provides a list of the landscape and ornamental plant species on the UH-Ma¯ noa campus found to be infested by the lobate lac scale. As we surveyed only the UH-Ma¯ noa campus, it is reasonable to expect the inclusion of additional host plant species within the broader urban landscape of the Honolulu metro area.
Management Information on the biology and control of lobate lac scale is limited. Research conducted at University of Florida showed that systemic insecticide imidacloprid (1-[(6-chloro-3-pyridinyl) methyl]-N-nitro-2-imidazolidinimine) was effective to some extent in controlling lobate lac scale on Indian laurel trees (Ficus retusa) when applied via soil drenching (Howard et al. 2005).
In December 2013, we started a project at UHMa¯ noa to test the efficacy and longevity of imidacloprid against lobate lac scale on weeping banyans (Ficus benjamina), one of the most severely infested plant species in Hawai‘i, using a trunk-injection method. Our data to date showed that imidacloprid via trunk injection, at the dose specified on the label (5% imidacloprid at 8 ml per inch diameter at breast height), was highly effective against lobate lac scale, with the longevity of control at least one year. We intend to continue monitoring the infestation for up to two years after treatment to assess the long-term efficacy. Pesticides residue analysis from the young twigs of treated trees is underway. In addition, we observed that moderate irrigation as a cultural practice provided benefits to

trees infested with lobate lac scales. Biological control methods could be considered as management options, but no potential biological control agents have been identified.
Trunk injection is a way to efficiently manage many different insect and disease problems, as well as nutrient deficiencies, in a manner that limits environmental exposure. Trunk injection involves using a special injection tool that places and seals the chemical directly into the trunk, where it is quickly taken up by the vascular system and distributed throughout the tree. It therefore limits the direct, negative impact to an applicator, to other people, and to the environment. In addition, the trunk-injection method typically uses relatively lesser quantities of pesticides compared to conventional treatment methods, such as soil drenching and foliar sprays, which reduces pesticide health concerns and environmental impacts. A study showed that the dose of pesticides required to control certain pests in a tree applied via trunk injection is 1/10th to 1/5th of that required in the soil-drenching application (Norris 1965). Reduced safety concerns using the trunk-injection method are of particular importance and interest for landscape pest management in urban areas, where human population density is high and environmental concern from the public is usually significant. In summary, our ongoing research indicates that imidacloprid via trunk injection could be a viable option to manage the lobate lac scale in Hawai‘i’s urban landscapes. For smaller plant species for which injection is not feasible, imidacloprid via soil drenching could be a viable management option.
