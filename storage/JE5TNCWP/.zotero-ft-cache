Guam Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle Eradication Project
SPLAT Bioassay 2: Attractivity of SPLAT Containing 5% Cypermethrin to
Adult Coconut Rhinoceros Beetles
Prepared by Aubrey Moore University of Guam Cooperative Extension Service February 7, 2011
This bioassay tests attractivity to adult CRB of RB-SPLAT containing 5% cypermetherin (RB-SPLAT-C).
1 Methods
CRB adults were ﬁeld collected from a compost pile on January 27, 2011. Beetles were held individually one quart Mason jars containing moist peat moss.
During the ﬁrst hour the beetle was subjected to 4 litres per minute of humidiﬁed breathing air. During the second hour, the beetle was subjected to 4 litres per minute of breathing air plus volatiles from RBSP LAT − C.
2 Results
When exposed to volatiles from RB-SPLAT-C, the beetle maintained a distance signiﬁcantly further away from the central air emitter (mean radius = 250 pixels for control, 300 pixels for treatment; p = 0.000005; Welch Two-sample T-test)(Figure 1.
When exposed to volatiles from RB-SPLAT-C, the beetle was signiﬁcantly more active (mean displacement per minute = 34 pixels per minute for control,

49 pixels per minute for treatment; p = 0.039; Welch Two-sample T-test)Figure 2.
