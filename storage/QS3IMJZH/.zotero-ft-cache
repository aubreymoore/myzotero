Loss of Ecosystem Services Provided by Birds

"Birds are an endangered class of animals ... we must fear that the vital ecosystem services that birds provide - such as the suppression of insect pests - will be lost." says Nyﬀeler.

Ecological Disasters on Guam
Brown treesnake (arrived around 1945) Killed most of Guam’s birds and small mammals. Caused 7 bird extinctions.
Asian Cycad Scale (detected 2003) Threatens survival of Guam’s endemic cycad.
Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle (detected 2007). Threatens Guam’s coconuts and other palms.
Little Fire Ant (detected 2011) Threatens most animals remaining in Guam’s forests.

IPM Tactics for Asian Cycad Scale
Insecticides can be used to protect ornamentals Biocontrol is the only feasable tactic for island-wide protection of Cycas
micronesica. A beetle predator has been introduced but attempts at introducing parasitoids have failed.

Asian Cycad Scale - Current Status on Guam
90% of Guam’s endemic cycads have been killed by the scale and other invasive species Cycas micronesica placed on the US National Endangered Species List in 2015. (Was the most abundant tree on Guam in 2002.) Mature plants are protected by the biocontrol beetle, but no natural reproduction is occurring

IPM Tactics

Eradication Attempt based on sanitation and mass trapping failed when CRB-G spread throughout Guam
Sanitation May be eﬀective when practiced by a village community, but ineﬀective island-wide.
Pheromone traps Ineﬀective for population suppression: mark-release-recapture indicates oryctalure traps have a capture rate of about 1% of available adults
Insecticide application cypermethrin can be used to protect palms
Biological control is the only feasable tactic for island-wide control Metarhizium majus (GMF) Successfully introduced from Philippines; survey indicates about 20% from fungal infection Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) CRB-G is resistant to all available isolates

Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle - Current Status on Guam
Mature coconuts and other palms are rapidly being killed by an uncontrolled outbreak of CRB-G which was triggered by Typhoon Dolphin in 2016 Damage estimates are not available. History suggests that we will loose 50% or more of our palms if the outbreak is not controlled. A search for an eﬀective biological control agent, most likely a new isolate of Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus is under way. If current outbreaks of CRB-G cannot be controlled, CRB-G will spread to other islands and possibly the Americas.

Conclusion
Development of IPM for invasive species which become wide-spread forest pests is diﬃcult. Classical biocontrol may be the only feasible, stand-alone tactic.
