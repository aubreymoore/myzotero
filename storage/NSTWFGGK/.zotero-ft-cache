Abstract
The purpose of this experiment is to determine if Rhodamine WT can be used as a uorescent tracer dye for quantifying how much SPLAT-RB + cypermethrin attracticide is picked up by adult rhono beetles making brief tarsal contact with the product. Dye was washed o beetles which had made brief tarsal contact by walking over a substrate coated with the SPLAT attricide. Dye was on these beetles was washed of with tap water. Fluorometer readings of wash water from these beetles was more than 20 times higher than readings for wash water from beetles not exposed to the attracticide. This result indicates that uorometry can be used to measure minute quantities of SPLAT attracticide picked up by brief contact between a beetle and the product.
Calibration
One percent (volume/mass) Rhodamine WT (5% stock solution) was added to SPLAT-RB + cypermethrin attracticide. A 31 mg sample of this was placed in a vial (#1) and 2 ml tap water was added. A 50% dilution series was made, resulting in 1 ml aliquots in vials numbered #2 through #6. An additional vial
1

(#0) was lled with tap water. Before reading with the uorometer, 3 ml of tap water were added to each vial, making a total volume of 4 ml.

Beetle Washes
Beetles 2 and 3 were held with tarsal contact to dyed SPLAT RB attracticide for 10 s. Beetles 7 through 9 were allowed to walk over a surface area coated
2

with non-dyed SPLAT RB. Beetles 4 through 6 and 10 through 12 were allowed to walk over an area coated with dyed SPLAT RB insecticide.
Each beetle was placed in a pottle and washed with x ml of tap water. One ml aliquots of the wash water was stored in vials numbered 2 through 12. Three ml of tap water was added to each vial before reading with the uorometer.
