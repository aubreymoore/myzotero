C . Vago, C . R . Acad. Sci. Paris, 277, 1413-1415, 1973).The excretion by adults of great amounts of viruses for a long period of time may partially explain the rapid spreading of the virus noted in Wallis Island, in the South Pacific, by C . Hammes (Calz. O R S T R O M Sér. Biol., 22, 52-91, 1974). Furthermore, the presence of virus particles in spermatids of adults and into chorionated ovocytes (P. Monsarrat, J. L. Duthoit, and C . Vago, C . R . Acad. Sci. Paris, 278, 3259-3261, 1974) allowed us to consider that other pathways of dissemination such as

transovarial transmission and contamination of the female by mating may also occur.
