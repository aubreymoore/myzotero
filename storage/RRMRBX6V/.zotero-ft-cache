The known mosquito fauna on Guam at the end of 1945was 10 speciesand included no anophe-

Prior to 1899, when Guam was ceded from Spain to the United States at the Treaty of Paris, very little was done in the areasof entomology or public health (Gressitt 1954).Beginning in 1899,the island was administeredby a naval governor appointed by the President of the United States. The governor was always a senior naval officer who also commanded the naval and marine facilities. Public health affairs were administered by a naval medical officer who was also in chargeof the medicalprogtams

one of reconstruction and redevelopment Pacific-wide and these activities were particularly apparent on Guam. Commercial air traffic was reestablishedand there was a steady influx of Filipino laborers from Luzon, American contraCtors and technicians from the continental United States, and U.S. military personnel and their dependents.This was also the genesisof the Far Eastern and western Pacific tourist

It was not until the 1920s that additional anopheline species were collected on Guam. Adult and immature forms of An. subpictus Grassi and An. uagusDcinitz were collecied at Apra Heights in 1970by R. F. Darsie,Jr. (Darsie and Ramos 1971).Reisenet al.

S. R. Vandenberg, entomologist at the Guam Agricultural Experiment Station, also pointed out in 1926 that the genus Arwpheles wae not known to be represented on Guam, and he was the first to mention the n'mber of caseson record of patients coming to Guam suffering from malarial fever contracted elsewhere and beinghospitalizedon the island. In a subsequent article (Vandenberg1928)he explainedthat the Anophelesmosquitoeswere the necessaryintermediate hosts of malaria and that the malarial feverscould not becomeepidemic and thus endemic on Guam since the island was free from this genus.F. E. Porter (1932) listed 22 blood examinations positive for malaria. These could have been on samples drawn from patients of the type describedby Vandenbergin his 1926 paper.

and An. litoralis King, were reported by Ward et al._in_1976,bringing the number of speciesof anopheline mosquitoes reported from Guam to nine. Only five of the collection records have beenverified, however.

At the end of 1988 the mosquito fauna on Guam was 24 establishedspeciesaccording to Ward (1984).This population comprised selven endemicspeciesand 1Tintroduced species.The latter may, according to R. A. Ward (fg84) be separatedinto four elements:a cosmotropicalor world wide_group of three species,four species present only in the Oriental area, one species only present in Micronesia, and a group of nine speciesoccurring in the Oriental and oneto four

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
The potential for malaria transmission continues to exist on Guam; however,it is doubtful that malaria has becomeendemicon the island. Autochthonousmalaria has occurredon two occasions. It is necessary that additional malaria vector speciesbe kept off the island, and that malarious visitors or residents be kept isolated from the local anophelinepopulation.
The island of Guam is a popular tourist tcrminal. As the number of interisland and international flights into and out of Guam increases, it will becomeimperative that an effective aircraft disinsectionprogrambeestablishedat both the commercial and military airports. Quarantine procedureshave been advocatedfor Guam since 1911 (Fullaway 1912), but the standard approach has been to place emphasis on mosquito surveillanceand area treatment programs for vector control.
Without effective aircraft disinsection and quarantine measuresthe total number of introduced mosquito specieson Guam will continue to increasewith the possibility that more efficient malaria vectors may arrive. Dispersal of

vectors via transport aircraft and ships from Guam to other islands within Micronesia is also a possibility. Control of the vector population can be achieved on Guam through the coordinated application of public health diseasesurveillance, quarantine proceduresat the air and sea ports, and a territorial pest management capability for administering an integrated anophelinecontrol program throughout the island.
