An incipient coconut rhinoceros beetle population was recently discovered on the island of Oahu, Hawaii and is currently the target of a large, mutiagency eradication program. Confounding this program is the widespread presence of another scarab beetle on Oahu, the oriental flower beetle, Protaetia orientalis (Gory and Percheron 1833). Eggs, early life stages, and fecal excrement of coconut rhinoceros beetle and oriental flower beetle are morphologically indistinguishable, thereby creating uncertainty when such specimens are discovered in the field. Here, we report the development of a multiplex PCR assay targeting cytochrome oxidase I of coconut rhinoceros beetle and oriental flower beetle that can rapidly detect and distinguish between these insects. This assay also features an internal positive control to ensure DNA of sufficient quantity and quality is used in the assay, increasing its reliability and reducing the chances of false negative results.","context":{"all":{"count":8963105,"mean":7.4077524027275,"rank":353847,"pct":96,"higher_than":8609225},"journal":{"count":1548,"mean":4.6201060116354,"rank":36,"pct":97,"higher_than":1511},"similar_age_3m":{"count":308470,"mean":12.227448087165,"rank":20512,"pct":93,"higher_than":287956},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":14,"mean":4.6683076923077,"rank":1,"pct":92,"higher_than":13}},"authors":["Watanabe, S.","Melzer, M.
