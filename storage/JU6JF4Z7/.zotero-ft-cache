Coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB)
Native range: Southeastern Asia (M. Schmaedick 2005 Am. Samoa) *CRB was introduced throughout the Pacific primarily due to
increased sea traffic during World War II.
*Most recently, CRB was discovered in Guam in September 2007.
*Primary damage is caused by adults boring from the petioles of fronds into the crown, cutting through developing leaves, and feeding on the exuded sap.
*The beetle breeds in dead, standing coconut palms killed by pest/ disease/ lightning, and in decaying organic materials, such as compost and sawdust heaps. (Bedford, 1980).
*Eggs hatch in 8-12 days; larvae feed on decaying coconut/palm debris for 82-207 days.
*Prepupal and pupal stage is 25-35 days; adult remains in the pupal cell for 17-22 days.
*Adults live for 4-9 months; each female lays 50-100 eggs.

Coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) - Damage Symptoms

*Primary damage is caused by adults boring from the petioles of fronds into the crown, cutting through developing, unopened fronds, and feeding on the exuded sap.

Active adult boring hole thru petiole

V-shaped cut on open fronds.

Similar to mechanical pruning damage to unopened
fronds

Coconut fibers resulting from adults’ boring

Active adult boring hole in petiole causing “wet look”

DAMAGE TO EMERGING FROND ON FOXTAIL PALM

EXPOSED COCONUT FIBER CAUSED BY BORING

Area attacked by adult beetle

Site of old adult boring hole

Adult boring hole thru frond petiole

Site of old boring holes in trunk

Symptoms of CRB attack: V-cuts with associated lateral boring thru fronds

Semi-circular damage caused by boring through folded new terminal growth

Most Efficient CRB Trap in Guam
• 50 gal steel barrel filled with rotting coconut debris, live CRB, grubs and aggregation pheromone.
• Ultraviolet LED light over trap.
• Chicken wire allows CRB to enter but not fly out (with spread wings).

Pheromone w/CRB

UV LED light plus pheromone increase trap efficiency (Moore & Quitugua, pers. com. 09/13)

Trap with chicken wire instead of vane
