Abstract
The genus Paratachardina Balachowsky (Hemiptera: Coccoidea: Kerriidae) is revised to include nine species: P. decorella (Maskell), P. minuta (Morrison), P. mithila Varshney, P. morobensis Williams & Watson, P. silvestri (Mahdihassan), P. ternata (Chamberlin), P. theae (Green), and two new species. Tachardina lobata Chamberlin (now P. lobata) is synonymized with Tachardia silvestri Mahdihassan (now P. silvestri), based on examination of type specimens. Paratachardina capsella Wang is transferred to Albotachardina Zhang as Albotachardina capsella (Wang) comb. nov. We provide a revised taxonomic key to the genera of the family Kerriidae and to all known species of the genus Paratachardina. All Paratachardina species are redescribed and illustrated with the exception of P. mithila. One of the new species described here is the polyphagous and pestiferous lobate lac scale, which damages trees and woody shrubs in Florida, U.S.A., the Bahamas and the territory of Christmas Island, Australia, and has been identified mistakenly as Paratachardina lobata (Chamberlin), an insect native to India and Sri Lanka. Here we recognize the lobate lac scale as a new species, name it

Paratachardina pseudolobata sp. nov. and describe it based on all stages of the female (adult, second instar and first instar). In addition, a second new species, P. mahdihassani sp. nov., is described based on adult females from India.
Key words: lac insect, lobate lac scale, pest, taxonomy, new species

Resumen
El género Paratachardina Balachowsky (Hemiptera: Coccoidea: Kerriidae) es revisado para incluir nueve especies: P. decorella (Maskell), P. minuta (Morrison), P. mithila Varshney, P. morobensis Williams & Watson, P. silvestri (Mahdihassan), P. ternata (Chamberlin), P. theae (Green), y dos especies nuevas. Tachardina lobata Chamberlin (ahora P. lobata) se sinonimiza con Tachardia silvestri Mahdihassan (ahora P. silvestri), basandose en la examinación de especimenes tipo. Paratachardina capsella Wang se transfiere al género Albotachardina Zhang como Albotachardina capsella (Wang) comb. nov. Se provee una clave taxonómica revisada para los géneros de la familia Kerriidae y para todas las especies del género Paratachardina. Todas las especies de Paratachardina son redescritas e ilustradas a excepción de P. mithila. Una de las nuevas especies descritas en el presente estudio es la escama lobada de laca cual es una plaga polífaga que causa daños a árboles y arbustos en la Florida, las Bahamas y en el Territorio de la Isla de Navidad, Australia y la cual ha sido misidentificada como Paratachardina lobata (Chamberlin), un insecto nativo de la India y Sri Lanka. Aqui reconocemos la escama lobada de laca como una nueva especie, y la nombramos Paratachardina pseudolobata sp. nov. y la describimos basandose en todos los estadios de la hembra (adulto, segundo instar y primer instar). En adición, una segunda nueva especie de la India, P. mahdihassani sp. nov., se describe e ilustra basandose en la hembra adulta.

Introduction
Lac insects constitute a family, the Kerriidae, of morphologically distinctive scale insects that produce gumlike or resinous secretions that form a hard scale cover or test (Chamberlin 1923; Varshney 1977, 1984; Lit 2002a). The best-known species is Kerria lacca (Kerr), renowned for its sticky resinous secretion (lac), which is used commercially as a natural polymer called shellac. The word “lac” is derived from Persian and Hindi words that mean “hundred thousand,” indicating the large number of insects required to produce shellac (Encyclopædia Britannica 2007). Approximately 90 species of lac insects have been described worldwide in nine genera (Ben-Dov 2006). Kerriid classification was established by the monographic works of Chamberlin (1923, 1925), with additional significant studies of Oriental, especially Indian taxa, by Varshney (1977, 1984), of South African Tachardina species by Munting (1965, 1966), and a review of New World Austrotachardiella species by Kondo & Gullan (2005). There is no recent taxonomic treatment of the whole family, but a key to genera is provided by Zhang (1992) and Kondo & Gullan (2005). The present work reviews the lac insect genus Paratachardina, which was erected by Balachowsky (1950) for the Australian species P. decorella (Maskell). Currently there are nine described species of Paratachardina (Ben-Dov 2006): P. capsella Wang from China, the type species P. decorella, P. lobata (Chamberlin) from India and Sri Lanka (records of P. lobata from elsewhere are misidentifications, as explained in this paper), P. mithila Varshney, P. silvestri (Mahdihassan)[see section on this species for an explanation of the correct spelling of this name] and P. ternata (Chamberlin) all from India, P. minuta (Morrison) from the Philippines, P. morobensis Williams & Watson from Papua New Guinea, and P. theae (Green) from China (including Taiwan) and India. There is no key to all described species of Paratachardina, although Varshney (1977, 1984) has a key to species that occur in India, and Chamberlin (1923) included five species in his key to Tachardina, as this genus included Paratachardina prior to its separation by Balachowsky (1950).
Until recently, little attention has been paid to Paratachardina species, even to P. theae, which is an occasional pest of tea plants (Green & Mann 1907; Chamberlin 1923). However, in 1999, a lac insect identified as P. lobata was first recorded in Florida and since 2002 has been reported as a serious pest there, as it is highly

polyphagous on woody plants (Hamon & Hodges 2002; Howard et al. 2004, 2006; Pemberton 2003; Pemberton et al. 2006). This pest has become known as the lobate lac scale. It was identified from the Bahamas in 1992 (Howard et al. 2004) and also from the Australian territory of Christmas Island, Indian Ocean, in 2002 (refer to collection data in this paper). After careful study of the morphology of type material of Tachardina lobata (now P. lobata) described by Chamberlin (1923) from Sri Lanka, we have determined that the lobate lac scale reported from Florida, the Bahamas and Christmas Island is a closely-related but undescribed species. Here we describe and illustrate the adult female, as well as the second-instar and first-instar nymphs of this new lac insect pest and compare the adult female to other species in the genus. We redescribe each named species of the genus based on the adult female, designate a lectotype if applicable, and also describe a new Indian species of Paratachardina. A revised taxonomic key to the species of Paratachardina and a revised key to lac insect genera are included together with a glossary of commonly used terms in lac insect taxonomy.
Material and methods
Specimens available for this study consisted of dry and slide-mounted museum specimens, as well as some recently collected material. A number of samples of the lobate lac scale as well as Indian species of Paratachardina were collected by S. Schroer and R.W. Pemberton as part of a biological control program for the lobate lac scale. We have examined the type specimens of seven named species of Paratachardina and, where applicable, we have designated lectotypes. Dry museum and ethanol preserved specimens were slide-mounted using the slide-mounting techniques of Williams & Granara de Willink (1992) except that xylene was used instead of clove oil, and were examined under a compound microscope. In the descriptions, the body shape of the adult female is described both as unmounted and as mounted on a microscope slide. An “unmounted” adult female refers to the insect's resinous test, either alive or preserved dry or in ethanol. Body length and width of the adult females and second-instar nymphs is measured in mm as mounted on the slide; other measurements are in microns. Length is measured from the apex of the head to the posterior end of the body. Width is measured as the greatest width. The length of each spiracle is the length of the spiracular apodeme plus the peritreme. The number of microducts in the marginal and ventral duct clusters are counted only for P. minuta, P. silvestri, the new Indian species and the lobate lac scale to facilitate separation of these closely related species. Descriptions of adult females are based on multiple slide-mounted specimens, as indicated for each species. The collection data, number of slides with the total number of specimens, and the depository in parentheses are given for each lot of material studied. Most listings for adult female specimens are abbreviated, for example, three adult females on two slides would be listed as "2(3)", whereas five first-instar nymphs mounted on one slide would be listed as "1(5 first-instar nymphs)". Each drawing is a generalization of several specimens and was prepared with the assistance of a camera lucida attached to an Olympus BX40 compound microscope.
The terms used to describe the lac insects follow those of Chamberlin (1923), Gill (1993) and Kondo & Gullan (2005), with the exception of Chamberlin's term “spermatozooid duct” which is herein amended to “spermatoid duct”. Chamberlin (1923) named these ducts because of their physical similarity to spermatozooids, but the correct adjective is “spermatoid”, meaning sperm-like, pertaining to structures which resemble spermatozoa in form or function (Gordh & Headrick 2001). The cuticular structures used to describe lac insects are unusual even for scale insects, and unfamiliarity with lac insect morphology is a deterrent to identification. Thus we have illustrated the important features used in the key to genera (Fig. 1) and have included a glossary of commonly used lac insect terms at the end of this paper. The abbreviations used for labelling structures on the illustrations are explained in the glossary and in the text. Scanning electron micrographs of some lac insect features can be found in Lit & Gullan (2001) and Lit (2002a, b).

Here we have separated the different size classes of microducts observed in Paratachardina species into large-sized, medium-sized and small-sized microducts arbitrarily. The small-sized microducts (ssm) are the most abundant microducts and are usually present dorsally and ventrally, and particularly around the body margin and submargins. Ventral duct clusters (vdc) are usually composed of medium-sized microducts (msm) only, and large-sized microducts (lsm) are found in the marginal duct clusters mixed with medium-sized microducts. The formula for the types and numbers of microducts in each marginal duct cluster (mdc) is specified by the total number of medium-sized microducts within each cluster, followed by the number of largesized or medium-sized microducts in the outer margin of the cluster, followed by the number of large-sized microducts within the cluster, in their respective order. For example, "mdc-i: 30–60/6–11/6–19" refers to the most anterior marginal duct cluster (mdc-i) which has 30–60 medium-sized microducts, 6–11 large-sized

Type material studied. Lectotype, hereby designated. Second-instar female. AUSTRALIA: Maskell label: "Tachardia / Carteria / decorella / adult female/ 1892 / W.M.M.", lectotype 0.77 mm long, 0.63 mm wide (ANIC). Paralectotypes. Same label data as lectotype, 1 slide (5 adult males) + 1 (1 second-instar female inside its test, + 1 empty male test) (NZAC). Although all syntypic material of this species belonged to the NZAC, that museum follows the principle that primary type material should reside in the country of origin of the species, if suitable repositories exist, and thus when lectotypes are designated for Australian species these can be deposited in the ANIC (Deitz & Tocker 1980).

KONDO & GULLAN

Ventral duct clusters 8 pairs in total, each small, composed of 3–15 (mostly 5–10) medium-sized microducts, each microduct 3–4 µm wide. Microducts outside ventral and marginal duct clusters smallest, each 2.0–2.5 µm wide, present marginally and submarginally, abundant particularly around marginal duct clusters. Spermatoid ducts similar to those on dorsum, detected around body margin, appearing most numerous within each marginal duct cluster, with 1 (rarely 2) ducts associated with each microduct. Ventral setae each 5–10 µm long.
Diagnosis. Paratachardina decorella can be distinguished from other species of Paratachardina by following combination of features: (i) four-segmented antennae; (ii) 8 pairs of ventral duct clusters; (iii) brachial plates almost equilateral triangular, each with 30–35 pseudospines; and (iv) legs completely absent. This is the only known species in the genus with 4-segmented antennae and marginal duct clusters composed of both medium-sized microducts and large-sized microducts, with large-sized microducts present only within each cluster. All other species have fewer antennal segments, and the marginal duct clusters have at least one or two large-sized microducts on the outer margins of each cluster, with the exception of P. morobensis in which all the microducts in each marginal duct cluster are of large size.
Notes. The full type host and type locality data for P. decorella are uncertain. Maskell (1893) stated that Mr. Koebele first sent him specimens of males and immature females on Myrica cerifera from Sydney, Australia, and later Mr. Olliff sent him two parcels of heavily parasitized adults at different times from a "native shrub", for which the bark did not appear the same to Maskell as that of M. cerifera. It is not clear whether Mr. Olliff’s second and third parcels were even from the same locality as the original collection of insects. One small pill box of dry material in NZAC is labelled in Maskell's handwriting as "Tachardia / decorella / Australia" and contains tests of adult females in good condition (several adult females, some damaged, were slidemounted by PJG in 1996). These specimens may not be part of Maskell's type series, although the appearance of the tests matches that in Maskell's (1893: plate XVIII, fig. 14) drawing of the adult female tests. The genus name "Tachardia" on the label suggests that these specimens may have been part of Maskell's later acquisitions, as he subsequently obtained further specimens from Mr. Koebele and also Mr. Froggatt from New South Wales as well as from Mr. French in Victoria, and at that time Maskell (1895) referred to this species as Tachardia decorella, as on the label of the dry material. Insects from the first collection sent to Maskell came from M. cerifera (Myricaceae), which is native to the southeastern U.S.A. (USDA-Plant database 2007), and thus the original collection by Koebele must have been from a garden plant. Besides P. decorella, there are other species of Paratachardina in Australia, but all are undescribed (I.L. Lit & P.J. Gullan, unpublished data).

marginal duct cluster (distribution not illustrated). Ventral setae each 7.5–10.0 µm long, about 6 or 8 present anterior to mouthparts, 2–5 present anterolateral to each pre-oral lobe, a group of 3–5 setae behind each posterior spiracle, a pair on last 3 abdominal segments anterior to vulva, 1 or 2 pairs on segment posterior to vulva, and a few setae on submargin of posterior apex, setae absent elsewhere.
Diagnosis. Paratachardina mahdihassani is very similar to P. silvestri but can be diagnosed by the following features: (i) ventral duct clusters totalling 6 or 7 pairs, with clusters of most anterior pair touching or almost touching (Fig. 1P) and each cluster with 24–41 microducts [5 to 6, rarely 7, pairs of vdcs with 10–20 microducts in each anterior cluster (total of both anterior clusters 24–40) in P. silvestri]; and (ii) test of adult female four-lobed and much narrower anteriorly than posteriorly, purplish red to dark brown in colour [test of P. silvestri similar but generally not as narrow anteriorly and more orange to wine red in colour] .
Morphological variation. Vestigial legs were present on a few specimens collected on 1–5.v.2006 on Pongamia pinnata, although they were completely absent on most specimens. Specimens from Gottipura appear to have slightly more pseudospines per brachial plate and slightly more spiracular pores around the posterior spiracles than the females from other collections (refer to the description above for ranges of counts for these features on Gottipura females versus typical females), and thus have been excluded from the type series.
Etymology and notes. This species is named after Dr S. Mahdihassan, an authority on Indian lac insects and author of Tachardia silvestri (now P. silvestri). Mahdihassan (1923a,b) apparently already had recognized the species that we name P. mahdihassani when he described P. silvestri. However, it seems that he believed that the new species herein described was T. minuta (later referred to as P. lobata). Mahdihassan (1923a: 48, 74, 75) describes "T. minuta" as follows: "The third insect of interest to us grows round about Bangalore on Pongamia glabra, an oil-producing tree of the leguminous order. ... This insect is identical with Tachardina minuta of Morrison, and my specimens were identified by him. ... The cells [test] on Pongamia are dark chestnut in colour with a distinct tinge of purple. At the marginal projections of the exudation a brownish blue colour is distinct. ... The first kind of cells [test of "T. minuta"] is smooth and elevated with only small projections in front, while the latter [T. silvestri] has two long finger-like projections instead." The description of "T. minuta" by Mahdihassan (1923a) closely matches the morphology of the test of our P. mahdihassani. Although initially Mahdihassan (1923a,b) called this species T. minuta, later (Mahdihassan 1946) he stated that "Tachardina lobata" was "the latest name for T. minuta". In that subsequent paper, Mahdihassan (1946) described two varieties of "T. lobata" based on morphological variation in shape of bacterial symbionts (refer to discussion under 'Notes' for P. silvestri).

mahdihassani, but can be separated readily from these species by the following features (character states of the other three species in parentheses): (i) presence of only 1 or 2, rarely 3, large-sized microducts on the outer margins of mdc-vii (4–9); (ii) 5–11 pseudospines on each brachial plate (16–40); and (iii) the subcircular shape of the test with more distinct ridges (X-shaped with ridges less regular and less well defined to absent).
Notes. Parachardina minuta is known only from the original material from the Philippines and there is no record of its collection for the last 80 years. It was erroneously recorded in Sri Lanka by Green (1922) based on a closely related species, which was soon after described by Chamberlin (1923) as Tachardina lobata. Furthermore, the transfer of this species to Paratachardina was by Varshney (1968), not Varshney & Teotia (1968) as listed in Ben-Dov (2006).

Dorsal spine small, conical, 68–70 µm long, with a hollow, not pointed tip; membranous pedicel of dorsal spine well developed, 70–103 um long and 70–103 µm wide. Anal tubercle well developed, 86–170 µm long, 120–140 µm wide; supra-anal plate subequal or slightly longer than its maximum width. Anal ring not divided in sectors; supra-anal plate forming a cup-shaped cavity. Anal fringe of few acute lobes, with narrow and deep clefts. Anal ring setae just reach, or slightly protrude past anal fringe. Antennae minute and obscure. Marginal duct clusters in 8 pairs, each roughly round, poorly demarcated, with ducts arranged irregularly. Ventral duct clusters present. Notes. Subsequent to his original description, Varshney (1997) listed the species name as "mithilae" rather than "mithila", without giving an explanation for his action. Varshney's (1968, 1977) descriptions do not specify the etymology of the name "mithila", and do not indicate whether it should be regarded as a noun or an adjective. According to the Article 31.2.2 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN 1999), the name “mithila” becomes a noun in apposition and should be retained as "mithila". Even though Varshney (personal communication) emended "mithila" to "mithilae" because the species was named after a woman, articles 31, 32 and 33 of the ICZN (1999) make it clear that such an alteration to the species name is an incorrect subsequent spelling, as recognised by Ben-Dov (2006). According to Varshney (1977), this species is similar to P. theae, from which it can be separated due to its larger adult female size, anal tubercle subequal in length and width, and pedicel of the dorsal spine not much longer than the length of the spine itself. Type material of P. mithila was not available in the present study, as we did not receive a reply to our request for a loan from the NZSI, and no type material or non-type topotypic specimens could be located in any other museum. Varshney (1977) gave a key to separate P. mithila and P.

theae as follows (Varshney 1977: 56, key couplet number 4):
– Anal tubercle slightly longer than its maximum width; pedicel of dorsal spine as long as spine itself ........ ........................................................................................................................................................... .mithila
– Anal tubercle distinctly broader than its maximum length; pedicel of dorsal spine much longer than the spine .......................................................................................................................................................theae
However, Varshney’s (1977) description of P. mithila overlaps with his description of P. theae in the character states used to separate them in the key. The minimum length and width of the anal tubercle of P. mithila given by Varshney’s (1977) description is 86 µm and 120 µm, respectively, in which case, there must be specimens for which the anal tubercle is distinctly broader than its maximum length. On the other hand, the anal tubercle in the syntypes of P. theae herein studied are approximately as long as wide, with some specimens being slightly longer than wide, and others being slightly wider than long. Furthermore, the length of the pedicel of the dorsal spine also varies in P. theae and sometimes is about the same length as the spine. Specimens from China collected on the same host genus as P. mithila, i.e., on Photinia benthamiana, were available for study (see 'Other material studied' under P. theae), but these could not be separated morphologically from P. theae. Thus adult females of P. mithilae and P. theae appear similar in all features considered and the two species cannot be separated with the available information (see also 'Diagnosis' of P. ternata).

membranous and inconspicuous, with an apical sclerotic plate bearing 2 long fleshy setae and 3 or 4 shorter setae. Clypeolabral shield 150–175 µm long, 125–130 µm wide. Labium apparently 2 segmented, 60–70 µm long, 65–85 µm wide. Pre-oral lobes elongate, poorly developed, present along margins of clypeolabral shield. Post-oral lobes present. Legs vestigial, represented by a membranous area 45–115 µm wide, bearing a membranous to sclerotic claw 15–40 µm long. Posterior spiracles much smaller than anterior spiracles, peritremes each 23–30 µm wide; with 20–35 spiracular pores present around each spiracle, each pore 4.0 µm wide. Marginal duct clusters distinct, 8 pairs in total; each composed of only large-sized microducts, each microduct 3–4 (mostly 4) µm wide, with 0–2 spermatoid ducts associated with its rim. Ventral duct clusters 8 pairs in total, each closely associated with a marginal duct cluster, all composed of numerous medium-sized microducts, each microduct 3–4 (mostly 3) µm wide. Microducts outside ventral and marginal duct clusters smallest, each 2–3 µm wide, present marginally and submarginally, abundant particularly around marginal duct clusters. Spermatoid ducts similar to those on dorsum, detected around body margin, appearing most numerous within each marginal duct cluster. Ventral setae each 7–10 µm long.
Diagnosis. Paratachardina morobensis is characterized by following combination of features: (i) brachial plates each with about 200 pseudospines; (ii) vestigial legs, each composed of a membranous tubercle and a claw; (iii) 8 pairs of well developed ventral duct clusters, each closely associated with a marginal duct cluster; and (iv) the presence of a vestigial anal fringe composed of a pair of poorly developed anal fringe plates or sword-shaped setae. Paratachardina morobensis differs from all other species currently included in the genus due to the presence of the following features (character states of other species in parentheses): (i) each brachial plate with 200 pseudospines (usually less than 100); vestigial legs composed of a membranous tubercle and a claw (legs usually absent, when present composed of a sclerotic area or claw, but not on a membranous tubercle); and (iii) marginal duct clusters composed of large-sized microducts only (composed of mediumsized and large-sized microducts).
Notes. The above description agrees well with that given by Williams & Watson (1990). However, we found more short setae at the apex of the antennae than Williams & Watson, and the dorsal spine duct illustrated by them resembles the non-dendritic type, but it is of the dendritic type. Some of the specimens studied were missing their dorsal spine duct, and these were probably removed during the clearing process of slide preparation. Only two collections are known for this species, both from Papua New Guinea on C. oligodon (Casuarinaceae). We did not examine the holotype (from the same collection as the paratypes that we studied) or the paratypes from Wau, all of which are deposited in the BMNH.

45–65 µm wide, dome shaped, with microtrichia. Legs completely absent. Posterior spiracles each 43–48 µm long (spiracular apodeme + peritreme), spiracular peritreme 18–21 µm wide; with 11–16 spiracular pores, each 4.0–5.0 µm wide, present around each spiracle. Marginal duct clusters distinct, oval to elongate oval, 8 pairs in total; each composed of 2 types of microducts: (i) medium-sized microducts with elongate oval rim, each 3.5–4.0 µm wide, most abundant type in each marginal duct cluster, and (ii) large-sized microducts with subcircular rim, each 4.0–5.5 µm wide, present on outer rim of cluster closest to body margin and on inner side of each cluster. Formula for marginal duct clusters as follows: mdc-i: 30–60/6–11/6–19; mdc-ii: 4–12/0– 3/0–4; mdc-iii: 8–11/2–3/2–3; mdc-iv: 8–10/2–3/3–4; mdc-v: 15–30/2–4/4–6; mdc-vi: 20–30/4–5/5–10; mdcvii: 15–32/4–6/4–10, and mdc-viii: 8–20/2–4/4–7. Ventral duct clusters subcircular or irregular in shape, all composed of medium-sized microducts, 4 pairs in total; pair just anterior to mouthparts (vdc-1) largest, each cluster of vdc-1 distinctly separated (Fig. 1N) and usually composed of 20–45 (rarely as few as 8; both clusters combined usually 41–86, but one female with 20 combined) microducts, with number of microducts often differing between left and right clusters; a small cluster (vdc-2) present lateral to labium on each side, each with 2–11 microducts; 2 pairs of clusters (vdc-3 and vdc-4) on abdominal region each with 4–9 microducts.

Diagnosis. Paratachardina pseudolobata can be diagnosed by the following features: (i) ventral duct clusters totalling 4 pairs, with clusters of most anterior pair well separated (Fig. 1N) and each usually with 20– 45 (41–86 combined) microducts, and (ii) test of adult female X-letter or bowtie-shaped with each of the four lobes of the test rather smooth, purplish red to dark reddish brown, often black due to sooty mould. [Refer to 'Diagnosis' of P. mahdihassani and of P. silvestri for comparisons.]
Morphological variation. No phenotypic variation related to place of collection was observed among the adult female specimens from Florida (U.S.A.), the Bahamas, and Christmas Island (Australia). The number of microducts in each vdc-1 can vary among individuals and between sides of the body of one individual, for example, there may be 13 microducts on the left side and 30 microducts on the right side on vdc-1. On one specimen from Christmas Island, there were 8 microducts on one side and 12 on the other side. This asymmetry occurs in some specimens of every population examined.

Notes. As noted above, adult females of this species display no morphological variation related to the known geographic localities, presumably because the species is exotic to each of its currently known areas. We list all specimens studied as part of the type series because of this lack of geographic variation and because the description of the adult female is based on the full range of specimens examined. Males were not found in the present study, nor in previous studies (in which this species is referred to as Paratachardina lobata lobata (Chamberlin)) (Howard et al. 2004; Mannion et al. 2005). This species appears to be parthenogenetic. Two winged parasitoid adults and two pupae of an unidentified encyrtid wasp were extracted from adult females of P. pseudolobata collected by T. Kondo on mango in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, U.S.A. and were kindly identified as encyrtids by Dr. Steve Heydon, University of California, Davis. P. pseudolobata is one of several polyphagous scale insect species causing canopy dieback on Christmas Island, although this species is not identified in any of the published papers on the subject (e.g., O'Dowd et al. 2003; Abbott 2005).
As explained in the introduction, this species has been known mistakenly as P. lobata in all previous literature discussing its biology and pest status. We identified this error in early 2006 when we began taxonomic work on this group. In their online identification key for scale insects, Miller et al. (2007) describe and illustrate the adult female of P. pseudolobata under the name "Paratachardina sp. nr. lobata", and also provide diagnostic notes based on information that we provided.
Etymology. The species epithet 'pseudolobata' is composed of the Greek word 'pseudo' meaning superficially resembling the original subject, or false, and 'lobata' the species with which it has been mistaken.

Venter. Antennae 88–125 µm long, 2 segmented, segmentation poorly defined, with a sclerotized area near base, with 2 longer setae and 2 or 3 shorter setae on sclerotized area at apex of terminal segment. Clypeolabral shield 138–163 µm long, 83–115 µm wide. Labium apparently 1 segmented, 42–58 µm long, 63–75 µm wide. Pre-oral lobes elongate, present along margins of clypeolabral shield on each side; post-oral lobes each 43–50 µm wide, dome shaped, with microtrichia. Legs completely absent. Posterior spiracles much smaller than anterior spiracles, each 40–48 µm long (spiracular apodeme + peritreme), spiracular peritreme 18–23 µm wide; with 6–12 spiracular pores present around each spiracle, each ca. 4.0 µm wide. Marginal duct clusters distinct, oval to elongate oval, 8 pairs in total; each composed of 2 types of microducts: (i) medium-sized microducts with elongate oval rim, each 3.5–4.0 µm wide, most abundant type in each marginal duct cluster, and (ii) large-sized microducts with subcircular rim, each 4.5–5.0 µm wide, present on outer rim of cluster closest to body margin and on inner side of each cluster. Formula for marginal duct clusters as follows: mdc-i: 30–65/6–12/10–17; mdc-ii: 10–15/2–5/2–6; mdc-iii: 8–12/3–4/2–5; mdc-iv: 6–10/2–4/3–5; mdc-v: 20–31/4– 9/7–10; mdc-vi: 20–35/4–8/8–10; mdc-vii: 15–32/4–8/4–11, and mdc-viii: 14–20/3–6/4–8. Ventral duct clusters subcircular or irregular in shape, all composed of medium-sized microducts, 5 to 6 (rarely 7) pairs in total; pair just anterior to mouthparts (vdc-1) largest with each microduct cluster of pair touching or almost touching (Fig. 1O), vdc-1: 10–20 microducts (combined 24–40); a small cluster (vdc-2) present lateral to labium on each side with 4–10 microducts; a small cluster (vdc-3) present just anterior to each metathoracic spiracle with 0–4 microducts, 3 pairs of well-developed clusters on abdominal region (vdc-4: 3–7 microducts; vdc-5: 5–8; vdc-6: 5–9), often with a vestigial cluster (vdc-7) with 0–2 microducts; ventral duct clusters often appearing as a continuous linear group of microducts. Microducts outside ventral and marginal duct clusters smallest, each with rim ca. 3.0 µm wide, present marginally and submarginally, abundant particularly around marginal duct clusters, and also present in 2 linear groups extending from area ventral to dorsal tubercle towards body margin, rest of ventral derm devoid of microducts. Spermatoid ducts hard to detect, similar to those on dorsum, present around body margin, appearing most numerous within each marginal duct cluster (distribution not illustrated). Ventral setae each 7–10 µm long, about 3 pairs anterior to mouthparts, a pair anterolateral to each pre-oral lobe, 1 or 2 setae next to each posterior spiracle, a group of about 5 setae behind each posterior spiracle, a pair on each of last 3 abdominal segments anterior to vulva, 2 pairs on segment posterior to vulva, and a few longer setae, each 15–20 µm long, on submargin of posterior apex, setae absent elsewhere.
Diagnosis. Paratachardina silvestri is similar to P. pseudolobata, but it can be separated from this species by the character states given in the key. It can be diagnosed by the following combination of features: (i) ventral duct clusters totalling 5 to 6 pairs (rarely an additional vestigial seventh pair, each with 0–2 microducts) [4 pairs in P. pseudolobata], with clusters of most anterior pair touching or almost touching (Fig. 1O), each cluster with 10–20 (total of both clusters 24–40) microducts [anterior pair well separated and each cluster with 20–45 microducts in P. pseudolobata]; and (ii) test of adult females four-lobed with 1–3 ridges on each lobe, resin of test often fused to adjacent tests; orange, wine red to dark reddish brown in colour [test rather smooth and purplish red to dark reddish brown, never orange, in P. pseudolobata]. For comparison of P. silvestri with P. mahdihassani, refer to the 'Diagnosis' of the latter.
Notes. Chamberlin (1925) criticised the publication of Mahdihassan (1923a) vehemently and ended his introduction by stating: "All further comments, changes and additions are made in their appropriate position in the following systematic section." (Chamberlin 1925: 32). In his section on Tachardina, Chamberlin used the name "Tachardina silvestrii" without explanation, although presumably he changed it deliberately. Mahdihassan did not indicate whether "silvestri" was a noun or an adjective and thus according to Article 31.2.2 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN 1999) "silvestri" should be treated as a noun in apposition and the original spelling retained. Chamberlin's "silvestrii" becomes an incorrect subsequent spelling and we use Mahdihassan's original spelling for the name of this species. Furthermore, the transfer of this species to Paratachardina was by Varshney (1968), not Varshney & Teotia (1968) as listed in Ben-Dov (2006).

Three subspecies of P. lobata (= P. silvestri) are listed by Ben-Dov (2006), i.e., Paratachardina lobata schmidti (Mahdihassan), P. lobata walczuchae (Mahdihassan), and P. lobata lobata (Chamberlin). However, no justification is provided for recognizing as subspecies the two varieties mentioned by Mahdihassan (1946), nor for recognizing P. lobata lobata as proposed by Ben-Dov (2006). According to article 45.6.4 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN 1999: 50), names of varieties described before 1961 should be treated as subspecies unless their author also expressly gave them infrasubspecific rank or the content of the work unambiguously reveals that the names were proposed for infrasubspecific entities. Mahdihassan's two varietal names fall into the infrasubspecific category, as explained below. Mahdihassan (1946) named two morphologically identical varieties, Tachardina lobata var. walczuchii and T. lobata var. schmidtii from the same locality (in Bangalore, India) but on different host plants (Michelia champaca and Guazuma tomentosa), and distinguished them from each other on the basis of morphologically different bacterial symbionts. Furthermore, Mahdihassan (1946: 136) commented as follows: "There is no meaning in naming one insect T. lobata and the other T. lobata variety Walczuchii, for one is as much as the other. Mere museum-specimens cannot but be simply called T. lobata, which might mean one or the other variety; cytologically and by blood smears the varieties can be easily distinguished". Kapur (1958, p. 38) recognized only the "walczuchii" variety and regarded the "schmidtii" variety as a synonym of Tachardina lobata. In a review of the Kerriidae, Varshney (1984) recognizes Mahdihassan's two names as mere varieties of P. lobata. We suggest that it is inappropriate to elevate these varietal names to subspecies level, and here we treat Mahdihassan's Tachardina lobata var. schmidtii and T. lobata var. walczuchii as varieties. However, we believe that Mahdihassan may have been referring to bacterial variation in the species that we describe above as P. mahdihassani (see under 'Etymology and notes' for that species) rather than in P. lobata (now P. silvestri). Unfortunately Mahdihassan designated no type specimens nor did he give any descriptions of the morphology for these varieties, and he appears not to have deposited any specimens in a museum. Hence, deliberately we have not considered either of these varietal names as possible valid names for our new species P. mahdihassani, but do list them above in the synonymy for P. silvestri.

ing at apex, length: 88–103 µm, 80–83 µm wide at base; membranous pedicel no longer than length of dorsal spine, slightly wider than base of dorsal spine. Anal tubercle well developed, tapering, highly sclerotized; preanal plate plus supra-anal plate, 188–205 µm long, 150–190 µm wide at widest point, pre-anal plate with a fibrous texture, supra-anal plate with a granular texture. Pygidial apodemes well developed, fairly sclerotized, extending from base of each anal tubercle towards body apex. Anal fringe probably incomplete, each anal fringe plate serrated or at least with some teeth. Anal ring entire, 38–40 µm wide, tip of setae surpassing anal fringe. Microducts scarce, each ca. 3 µm wide, present submarginally, with several ducts present on each antero-anal lobe. Spermatoid ducts: 1–3 associated with each microduct. Dorsal setae each 4–6 µm long marginally or submarginally, with longer setae, each 7–10 µm long, lateral to pygidial apodeme.
Venter. Antennae 128–158 µm long, 2 segmented, segmentation poorly defined, with a sclerotized area delineating both segments, with 2 longer setae and 2 or 3 shorter setae on sclerotized area at apex of terminal segment. Clypeolabral shield 126–139 µm long, 90–95 µm wide. Labium apparently 1 segmented, 43–73 µm long, 65–73 µm wide. Pre-oral lobes elongate, poorly developed, present along margins of clypeolabral shield on each side; post-oral lobes present, dome shaped, with microtrichia. Legs completely absent. Posterior spiracles each 43–50 long, peritremes each 20–25 µm wide; with 12–16 spiracular pores present around each spiracle within spiracular pocket, each pore 5.0–6.0 µm wide. Marginal duct clusters distinct, subcircular, 8 pairs in total, each composed of two types of microducts: medium-sized microducts, elongate oval, each ca. 4 µm wide, most abundant, making bulk of each marginal duct cluster, and large-sized microducts, subcircular each ca. 5 µm wide, present on outer rim of cluster closest to outer margin, and on inner areas of each cluster. Ventral duct clusters in loose subcircular or irregular groups, all composed of medium-sized microducts, 7 or 8 pairs in total, pair just anterior to mouthparts (vdc-1) largest, a small cluster (vdc-2) with 2–6 microducts, close to mdc-ii, often hard to detect, and 5 or 6 pairs of clusters posterior to antennae, if 8th pair (vdc-8) present, with 1–4 microducts. Microducts outside ventral and marginal duct clusters smallest, each ca. 3.0 µm wide, present marginally and submarginally, abundant particularly around marginal duct clusters. Spermatoid ducts similar to those on dorsum, detected around body margin, appearing most numerous within each marginal duct cluster. Ventral setae usually 4–6 µm long, longer setae, each 14–18 µm long, present on abdomen between vulva and body apex.
Diagnosis. Paratachardina ternata is characterized by following features: (i) body broadly pyriform or trilobed; (ii) 7 or 8 pairs of ventral duct clusters, with vdc-2 close to mdc-ii but often difficult to detect; (iii) 35–60 pseudospines on each brachial plate; and (iv) sclerotized pygidial apodemes. Paratachardina ternata appears closest to P. mithila and P. theae as all three have a trilobed body as mounted on the slide. However, P. ternata can be separated from the other two species by the following features (character states of P. mithila and P. theae in parentheses): (i) vdc-2 close to mdc-ii (vdc-2 close to mdc-iii); (ii) absence of a pair of round outpockets of membranous cuticle with a reticulate surface in the area surrounded by the anal tubercle, dorsal spine and pre-anal lobes (present in P. theae at least); and (iii) well-developed pygidial apodemes present (pygidial apodemes absent).
Notes. The type locality is misspelt as "Travencore" in Ben-Dov (2006).

marginally and submarginally, abundant particularly around marginal duct clusters. Spermatoid ducts: 1 or 2 ducts associated with each microduct. Ventral setae usually 6–10 µm long, with longer setae, each 10–15 µm long, present on abdomen between vulva and body apex.
Diagnosis. Paratachardina theae is characterized by the following features: (i) lac test with about 16 poorly to well defined longitudinal ridges, each ridge smooth or with a nodulose texture; (ii) a subcircular group of 40–50 pseudospines on narrower part of each brachial plate; (iii) pedicel of dorsal spine as long as or longer than spine, with a constriction at its base; (iv) rather long membranous brachia; and (v) 6 or 7 pairs of ventral duct clusters present in loose subcircular or irregular groups. This species is indistinguishable from P. mithila at this point (see 'Notes' under P. mithila). Together with P. mithila, P. theae is most similar to P. ternata (see 'Diagnosis' for P. ternata).
Notes. The transfer of this species to Paratachardina was by Varshney (1968), not Varshney & Teotia (1968) as listed in Ben-Dov (2006). Although the type depository for this species is listed only as BMNH in Ben-Dov (2006), we consider that the specimens deposited at BME are syntypic since they match the host, the main locality and the collector given in the original description of the species (i.e., on tea plants in Darjeeling in February 1907, by H.H. Mann), and were sent by its author E. E. Green to G. F. Ferris and originally were labelled as "Tachardia decorella theae Green" or "Tachardia decorella var. theae Gr." although the genus name was subsequently edited to "Tachardina", presumably by Chamberlin, who initialled the slide labels "JCC". Furthermore, a small box containing lac insects labelled as "Tachardia decorella Mask. / on Cinchona calisaya / Darjeeling, India / from the Govt. Cinchona Station / 8971, EEG", listed in the original description as the typical form (i.e. Tachardia decorella), is deposited in the BME collection. We have not examined specimens in the BMNH and thus have not designated a lectotype.

Albotachardina capsella (Wang) comb. nov.
Paratachardina capsella Wang, 1986: 196.
The species P. capsella Wang fits well into the genus Albotachardina Zhang, and thus is here transferred to this genus as Albotachardina capsella (Wang) comb. nov. Albotachardina is characterized by having: (i) brachial plates usually with an elevated area or accessory projection (Fig. 1D); (ii) brachia membranous, fairly long and often narrow; (iii) dorsal spine present at the end of a long and narrow membranous tube (Fig. 1E); and (iv) the absence of perivulvar pore clusters (Zhang 1992).
Two species are currently included in the genus Albotachardina: A. yunnanensis Zhang and A. sinensis Zhang (Zhang 1992; Ben-Dov 2006). Albotachardina capsella appears most similar to A. sinensis Zhang, with which it shares 4-segmented antennae and 16 marginal duct clusters (A. yunnanensis has 3-segmented antennae, and 12 marginal duct clusters). Based on the descriptions by Wang (1986) and Zhang (1992), A. capsella differs from A. sinensis in the following features: (i) presence of 1 or 2 spines at the end of a group of pseudospines on the brachial plate elevation, with one lateral seta next to each group of pseudospines (no spines in A. sinensis); (ii) pseudospines on brachial plate outside of dense group on protrusion in the form of tubularlike processes (all pseudospines on brachial plate similar in A. sinensis); and by (iii) the usual presence of a short line of microducts lateral to each marginal duct cluster (absent in A. sinensis). No specimens of P. capsella were available for study.

KONDO & GULLAN

Chamberlin (1923), Gill (1993), Kondo & Gullan (2005), Lit (2002a, b) and Lit & Gullan (2001) with some modifications.
Anal fringe (af): A series of ligulate lobes at the apex of the anal tubercle encircling the anal ring. Anal ring (ar): In the family Kerridae, the anal ring always bears 10 setae, and often has an irregular row of pores, although the pores can be absent. The anal ring may be divided into 4, 6 or more distinct sections (e.g. Fig. 1K & L), or it can be entire (unsegmented, as in Fig. 7) or show partial segmentation (Fig. 6). Anal tubercle (at): The anal tubercle is the posterior and dorsal sclerotized prolongation of the body that bears the pre-anal plate (in some groups), the supra-anal plate, the anal fringe and the anal ring. According to Lit & Gullan (2001) for Austrotachardia species, the pre-anal plate represents a segment anterior to the anal ring (e.g., possibly abdominal segment VII), which together with the anal and penultimate segments, forms the anal tubercle. Antennae (ant): The antennae are always present, and consist of 1–7 segments, although the segmentation is often poorly defined. Antennal position may vary from slightly anterolateral to the mouthparts, to displaced to near the body margin lateral to the mouthparts, or displaced onto the dorsal surface of the head. Antero-anal lobes (aal): Here we coin this term to refer to a pair of lobes present anterior to the anal tubercle in most species of Paratachardina. These lobes usually have a number of microducts associated with them (e.g., Fig. 7) and, in live insects, these lobes face upward (Fig. 2C). Brachium (br): (Greek, brachion, arm-like process; Latin, -ium = diminutive) (Gordh & Headrick 2001). The membranous, often slightly to heavily sclerotized, tubular protrusion that bears the brachial plate. The brachia either can be absent, very short (sessile) or very long. Varshney (1977, 1984) proposed the name "branchium" from the Latin "branchium" (derived from the Greek brankhium meaning gill) instead of brachium, arguing that branchium provides greater meaning since the structure is associated closely with the anterior spiracle. However, Varshney’s proposal has been largely ignored outside India (Lit 2002a). Brachial plate (brp): The brachial plate is a heavily sclerotized, round, triangular to quadrate, often irregular-shaped plate that bears brachial pores, brachial plate setae and pseudospines (Fig. 2C, vignettes Figs 3–8 & 10–12). The plate may be flat, or have a shallow or deep crater, or may be an elevated protrusion. Brachial plate setae (bpset): Setae present on the brachial plates (vignettes Figs 6–8). Brachial pores (brp): Brachial pores usually with 5-loculi and similar in structure to spiracular pores and canellar pores (vignettes Figs 7 & 8). Canella: The term canella, plural canellae, was coined by MacGillivray (1921) to refer to the spiracular furrow of scale insects. Later, Chamberlin (1923) adopted the term canella to refer to a linear group of multilocular pores [canellar pores (canp)] present in the area between the anterior spiracles and the mouthparts, or between the anterior and posterior spiracles (e.g. some Tachardiella). Chamberlin’s (1923: plate X, fig. B) illustration of Paratachardina silvestri (as Tachardina lobata) illustrates a reduced canella adjacent to the anterior spiracle on the ventral side, however, the canella of this species is present dorsally. Thus, herein we expand the definition of canella to include those multilocular pores present between the anterior spiracles and the brachial plates in order to accommodate those canellar pores present on the dorsum. Dorsal spine (dspi): Together with the brachial plates, the dorsal spine is one of the most characteristic features of the family. It consists of a conical, hollow spine located dorsally anterior to the anal tubercle. An opening is usually apparent at the apex, and the spine may split near the apex in some species. A dorsal spine occurs on all lac insect species, with the exception of Tachardina albida Cockerell. Dorsal spine duct: The internal duct(s) found associated with the dorsal spine. Duct length and structure varies greatly, but ducts usually are divided into two types: (i) the dendritic type is most common and is quite branched throughout its entire length (vignettes Figs 3–7 & 10–12); and (ii) the non-dendritic type is only known in Austrotachardia and is unbranched throughout its length, either ending on a swollen or branched apex (Fig. 1F–I). Lit (2001a) used the term "fibrous" to refer to the non-dendritic type of dorsal spine ducts.

REVISION OF PARATACHARDINA (KERRIIDAE)

Zootaxa 1617 © 2007 Magnolia Press · 37

Macroduct: In the New World genera Tachardiella and Austrotachardiella, there are large-sized ducts of a different structure compared to the smaller microducts. These ducts have a cylindrical shape with a long and slender tail which branches near its end (Fig. 1Q).
Marginal duct clusters (mdc): Subcircular to irregular clusters of microducts and/or macroducts and/or spermatoid ducts present around the body margin. The presence or absence, sizes, and combination of microducts, macroducts and spermatoid ducts can be useful features at the generic and species level. Chamberlin (1923) describes a series of types of marginal duct clusters. His simplex mdc consists of ducts of one size and structure (e.g., as on females of Kerria lacca, Fig. 1A), his duplex mdc contains ducts of two types or sizes but with many variants of duct structure, whereas the triplex type of mdc has three kinds of ducts. In the New World genus Tachardiella, duplex mdcs are composed of macroducts and spermatoid ducts only (Fig. 1B), whereas Austrotachardiella has triplex mdcs composed of macroducts, spermatoid ducts and an outer narrow band of microducts (Fig. 1C). In Afrotachardina, mdcs have two closely associated auxiliary clusters of microducts (Fig. 1J). In practice, Chamberlin's classification into simplex, duplex and triplex mdcs is difficult to apply because there is so much variation among genera in the types and sizes of ducts present. Furthermore, he uses the confusing terms "nuclear ducts" (referring to ducts central in a cluster) and "duplex ducts" (meaning secondary ducts) even if these ducts differ only in size and not in structure.
Microduct (m): Microducts of the Kerriidae resemble the typical coccid ventral microduct, with a subcircular duct opening and short terminal gland. Small-, medium- and large-sized microducts are abbreviated as ssm, msm and lsm, respectively.
Oral lobes: In some taxa, there are one or two pairs of membranous, often slightly sclerotized lobes surrounding the mouthparts. Chamberlin (1923) coined the term post-oral lobes (pol) for the pair posterior to the mouthparts, but did not discuss the pair anterior to the post-oral lobes seen in some taxa. Therefore, we here propose the name pre-oral lobes (prl) for the anterior pair.
Pedicel: The membranous tube that bears the dorsal spine (Figs. 1E and 12). The pedicel can be very short or absent, or very long and slender as in Albotachardina.
Perivulvar pores (= Perivaginal pores; Chamberlin (1923)): Multilocular pores found around the vulva, either singly (i.e., Tachardina spp.) or within perivulvar pore clusters. These pores are absent in Austrotachardia and Paratachardina. Chamberlin (1923) and many subsequent workers used the term "perivaginal" to refer to the position around the vulva, but more recent workers have used the term "perivulvar" (Gill, 1993; Lit 2001a; Kondo & Gullan 2005), which is more widely used in the Coccoidea.
Perivulvar pore clusters: Clusters of multilocular pores present around the vulva or in some genera running in a linear group lateral to the vulva. These clusters are absent in some genera (e.g., Austrotachardia, Paratachardina and Tachardina, although isolated pores are present in the latter genus), and range from 4 in Tachardiella and Austrotachardiella, to 18–50 in Kerria. (= Perivaginal pore clusters; Chamberlin 1923).
Pre-anal plate (papl): The basal part of the anal tubercle anterior to the supra-anal plate is called the preanal plate (Fig. 7), and can be either sclerotized, membranous or absent in some taxa.
Pseudocerarii (pscer): A pair of closely associated pseudospines on the body margin near the body apex of lac insect first-instar nymphs (Miller 1991).
Pseudospine (psspi): On the brachial plates, there is a type of specialized multilocular pore that resembles a seta or spine when viewed sideways, but a pore with 5 or 6 loculi when viewed from the top (Chamberlin 1923). Most pseudospines have 5 loculi, but occasionally a few have 3, 4, or 6 loculi (Lit 2002b). In the first-instar nymph (Fig. 9), the homologous structures are hollow spines located in the anterior spiracular cleft and in the pseudocerarii (Miller 1991).
Pygidial apodemes: More or less heavily sclerotized internal rods or processes that extend posteroventrally from the base of the supra-anal plate. Chamberlin (1923) referred to these apodemes as extending to "caudad of the dorsal spine", but this is incorrect.
Spermatoid duct (spd): Long thread-like ducts with a greatly swollen area just below duct opening (see

Fig. 1B & C, vignettes Figs 3–12). These ducts are probably involved in secreting the bulk of the lac test. Chamberlin (1923) introduced the term spermatozooid duct, however, this is an incorrect use of the term and has been amended herein to spermatoid duct (see 'Materials and Methods' for explanation). These ducts may occur singly or, in some genera, associated with the rim of microducts.
Spiracles: In the family Kerriidae, as in other neococcoid families, there are two pairs of thoracic spiracles, but no abdominal spiracles. The anterior spiracles (antsp) in the adult female lac insects may be located on either surfaces of the body and are always larger than the posterior spiracles (psp), which usually are present on the ventral surface of the body (Figs 3–7 & 10–12).
Spiracular pores (spp): Multilocular pores present surrounding the spiracular peritreme (vignettes Figs 4, 6 & 7). In the Kerriidae, these pores mostly have 5-loculi, and often are similar in structure to canellar and brachial pores.
Supra-anal plate (spanpl): The terminal sclerotized part of the anal tubercle, bearing the anal fringe and the anal ring (Fig. 7).
Ventral duct clusters (vdc): These are subcircular to irregular shaped clusters of microducts present submarginally or submedially around the ventral body and often are present parallel to the marginal duct clusters (vignettes Figs 4, 5, 7 & 10). In Paratachardina, there is always 1 or 2 pairs of vdcs on the head anterior to the mouthparts, but Chamberlin (1923: plate X, fig. B) erroneously labelled this cluster on P. silvestri (then Tachardina lobata) as "dorsal duct cluster".
