<h2 id="sloth">Sloth</h2>
<p>
I'm big on sloth. Sloth is cheap, and easy to get. You need a partner or at
least an object to get the most out of lust, gluttony and avarice both take
something of a financial investment, but sloth is damned convenient. You can get
in some quality sloth in your own bedroom, watching TV or even at the office.
And if anyone gives you a hard time about it, just point out that by doing
nothing, you're helping to slow down the endless march of entropy and delay the
eventual heat death of the universe. <strong>B+</strong>
</p>

<h2 id="gluttony">Gluttony</h2>
<p>
Most people group sloth and gluttony together as the Slob Sins, but the fact is
that your dedicated glutton puts a lot of effort into his or her sin. Finding
the stores with the pillowcase-sized bags of potato chips, checking out which
lunch buffets shut down at 2:00 and which go on until 3:30, taping Nabisco
commercials--gluttony can be hard work. Take time out to give a glutton you know
a pat on the back and a bite of your sandwich, just to say "Hey, thanks for
being a glutton." <strong>C+</strong>
</p>

<h2 id="wrath">Wrath</h2>
<p>
Lousy sin. Unsociable, bad on the nerves, and drives property values down. And
what do you have to show for it? An ulcer and bruised knuckles, that's what. And
it's so vulgar. Take it from me, pass on the wrath. Not only will you be less
damned, you'll be happier. <strong>D</strong>
</p>

<h2 id="lust">Lust</h2>
<p>
Ah, lust. Putting the "deadly" back into the Seven Deadly Sins. The nasty thing
is that while you need to trade liquids to get dead from lust, all you have to
do to be damned to eternal hellfire and torment is lust in your heart. Talk
about insult to injury. I lust in my heart all the time-- heart, brain,
endocrine glands, the whole shebang. Even if I WANTED to not lust, I'm not sure
how I'd go about it. Still, of all the deadly sins, this one is its own reward.

</p>

<h2 id="pride">Pride</h2>
<p>
I'm not sure how this one works. Is plain old everyday pride sinful or do you
have to get into the realm of hubris before you're in trouble? Do you go to hell
for saying "this is a pretty tasty three-bean salad I've made, if I do say so
myself," or do you have to say "why, I bet this is a better three-bean salad
than GOD could make"? And what about self-esteem? My high school counselors were
always pushing self-esteem on me. Were they pawns of the Adversary? So many
questions. <strong>C</strong>
</p>

<h2 id="envy">Envy</h2>
<p>
This is another of those thinking sins. Do you get damned for THINKING about
another slice of pie? Do you burn for CONSIDERING hitting the snooze alarm? No,
of course not, but all you have to do is covet something of someone else's and
boom, you're a brimstone hors d'oeuvre. You don't have to lay a HAND on your
neighbor's manservant to get the ecclesiastical zot. There should really be some
sort of appeals process. <strong>C-</strong>
</p>

<h2 id="avarice">Avarice</h2>
<p>
Also known as greed. Got a lot of good press in the eighties. Still has a lot of
supporters. If gluttony were as popular as greed the snack food industry would
own us all like so much stacked firewood. The problem with avarice is that it
gets pretty ludicrous pretty quickly. From billionaires buying a dozen gold
cadillacs to bozos gushing over costume jewelry on the Home Shopping Network,
greedy people inevitably end up looking goofy in public.
