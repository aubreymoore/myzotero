Highlights

•

    Invasive erythrina gall wasps, Quadrastichus erythrinae , caused severe impacts on endemic Erythrina sandwicensis in Hawaii.
•

    A biological control agent, Eurytoma erythrinae , was introduced to Hawaii from East Africa.
•

    E. erythrinae establishment was confirmed within 4 months at all release locations, and reduced damage to foliage of trees significantly rapidly.
•

    Classical biological control may have contributed to ensuring the survival of this endemic tree species.

Abstract

Erythrina gall wasp, Quadrastichus erythrinae (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) began a global range expansion around 2005, and is considered a significant adventive pest in Asia, Pacific islands, South- and Central America, and North America, including Hawaii. The Hawaii endemic wiliwili tree, Erythrina sandwicensis (Fabaceae) was severely impacted and threatened with extinction, leading to the release of a classical biological control agent, Eurytoma erythrinae (Hymenoptera: Eurytomidae) from southern and East Africa, in 2008. Establishment was confirmed by retrievals of wasps within 1–4 months at all release locations. throughout Hawaii, and reduced impacts to trees within two years. By 2018, the majority of trees sampled incurred less than 33% gall damage to their foliage. E. erythrinae reduced Q. erythrinae damage by >85% in some locations throughout Hawaii and may have contributed substantially to preventing the extinction of this endemic tree.
