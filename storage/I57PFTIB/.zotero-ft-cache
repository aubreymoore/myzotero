Abstract
During last decade we have developed and applied optical remote sensing instrumentation for in situ remote surveillance and quantification of the aerofauna. The sparse structure of aerofauna makes optical focusing challenging, but we solved this issue through applying the century old Scheimpflug condition. With this approach we have managed to reduce size, cost and complexity of atmospheric lidars and accomplished an effective tool for ecological entomology capable of counting thousands of insects per hour. Because of the high sensitivity and resolution in time and space, we can retrieve target modulation signatures in the kHz range for target classification purposes. As opposed to the cm waves in entomological radar, we rely on near infrared light around one micron. This allow superior beam quality, negligible ground clutter and applications close over ground or within vegetation structure. Near infrared light can assess both molecular and microstructural properties of the target through differential absorption and depolarization. Here we give the background of entomological lidar, summarize our recent progress and put it in context with contemporary work. We outline applications, ongoing activities and state of the art. We discuss future prospects and challenges.
1. Background
Following WWII development of radar, radar ornithology1,2 and later radar entomology3,4 emerged in the last century. This century entomological lidar emerged5-8 with time-offlight lidars at kHz rates developed in Montana. Our group in Lund started out using a slower atmospheric lidar at hand9-12 in particular explorer feasibility of fluorescence lidar. We later also developed kHz methods13,14. As opposed to insect sampling with sweep nets and traps (see e.g.15) remote sensing has the advantages of being non-intrusive, nonperturbing and with known biases and detection ranges and limits. Further, remotely sensed insects are to some extend classified automatically16,17, whereas analysis of caught insects is tedious but provide more details18,19. Most radar entomology studies have targeted high migrating insects by vertical profiling. The size ratio between a large aircraft and insects is roughly the same at the wavelength ratio between microwaves in radar and infrared light and as opposed to microwaves, laser and optics offer great beam qualities allowing investigations of entomological ecology close over ground or within forest without ground clutter. Lidar and photonics methods also offer assessment of molecular and microstructural information through absorption, fluorescence

and depolarization processes. Applications of entomological lidar includes monitoring abundance and dispersal of agricultural and forestry pest, disease vectors for humans and livestock and not least assessing biodiversity of pollinators. We will here give an overview of the recent progress in the field.
2. Instrumentation
2.1 Passive lidar As in passive radar20, insects can be sensed optically using existing radiation sources such as the sun for diurnal species21, the moon22 or thermal infrared emission23 for nocturnal species. Sunlight offer a range of wavelengths from UV to IR and some 1kWm-2 of power. We started out developing the remote dark-field method21 which gives lidar like signals across the spectrum without need of laser development. This method is based on directing a telescope at a remote black cavity and collect the light scattered from airborne insects. We demonstrated powder tagging and darkfield modulation spectroscopy24 and heading assessment by quadrant detection13 (corresponding to beam wobbling in radar). The method can also be employed at several spectral bands at kHz rates for determining body and wing melanisation25,26. For some time we attempted passive ranging27 but only recently provided a solution using quadrant detection28.
2.2 Time-of-Flight entomological lidar Equivalently to radar, conventional lidar is based on transmission of ns long laser pulses and recording the backscattered intensity with fast detectors and RF electronics as a function of round-trip delay. Applied systems ranges from slow conventional multiband systems10,29,30 to fast single band systems8,31.
2.3 Scheimflug lidar Similarly to bistatic radar, atmospheric Scheimpflug lidars utilise transmitted and receiver separated by a small baseline of roughly a meter13,32-35. The Scheimpflug principle allow infinite focal depth with large apertures14, therefore weak signals from insect scattering can be retrieved at kHz rates. The average emitted power can greatly exceed pulsed lidars despite the much smaller and inexpensive lasers. The systems can efficiently collect high number of observations32,34 (See. Fig.1). Scheimpflug lidars can be expanded to retrieve several spectral bands31,36,37 or polarisation modes33,35. For example for assessing melanin (See Fig.2). Scheimpflug lidar

can also retrieve fluorescence38 with applications for insect powder tagging10,24,39, however violet light may affect the insects40.

analogy with early radar referencing42 the Montana group recorded polarimetric backscatter of pinned bees7. Our group recorded oscillatory cross sections of free flying insects43,44
including spectral and polarisation modes feasible for lidar. We also applied hyper spectral imaging45, goniometry46 and polarisation imaging41 of pinned insects (See Fig.3).
Referencing can also be done by releasing known insects into the lidar beam in field47 or sampling insect along the beam with a trap48.

3. Methods, purpose and outcome.
3.1 Organism sizing
If the lidar beam-FoV overlap function can be determined,
e.g., by a molecular Rayleigh echo and assumptions of homogeneous atmosphere32, then backscatter intensities can be converted into Lidar Cross Sections in mm2. Whereas
RCS related to liquid water mass, Lidar Cross Section was
defined as the projected area had the target been a 100%
Lambertian reflector such as a Teflon beat. In practice insect reflectance in near infrared34,41, 808 nm, is in the order of 20%, the reflectance in short wave infrared45, 1320 nm, is in the order of 80% whereas specular reflectance46 could reach 5000%. Despite this, organism sizing allow estimation of the aerofauna biomass spectrum32 and insect and predating vertebrate can display a bimodal biomass spectrum34.
Biomass spectra are popular in marine science,

infrared Scheimpflug lidar, the melanisation of body and wings can be derived (adapted from31).

3.2 Modulation spectroscopy for target classification
The wing beat cycle causes backscatter and extinction cross
section to oscillate with a fundamental tone and a harmonic spectrum. This spectrum has proven valuable for target classification16,49,50 or even biodiversity assessment51. The
methods are directly applicable for entomological lidar
applications but the work is mainly based on so called E-traps
somewhat simpler than lidar and often operating in extinction
mode. The drawback is that the counts per day are much lower than lidar32,34,50. Much of this work involve advanced
machine learning but even the fundamental tone can differentiate species, e.g.52. Some challenges are that the tone is temperature dependent53, that harmonic spectrum is aspect dependent28,43,44 and that identification of the fundamental tone is difficult54. Modulation spectroscopy can be expanded by additional spectral and polarisation bands (See Fig.4).

2.4 Reference measurements Effort was put into quantifying and understanding optical backscatter- and extinction-cross sections for insects for comparison and feasibility of remote target classification. In

3.3 Powder tagging Insect can be tagged optically using fluorescent powders

2

from the printing and advertising community, and several colours can be used simultaneously. This is referred to as mark-without-recapture studies and yield the greatest certainty about target identity. Social insects such as bees can be auto-tagged by installing a tray in the hive exit. Powdered individuals can be detected remotely either by sunlight24 or violet lasers10,29,38. Applications of tagging include landscape dispersal studies, population size estimates and verifications of classification, e.g., by modulation spectroscopy. Corresponding tagging in radar entomology is accomplished by harmonic radar by attaching electrical diodes to the insects55.
3.4 Heading assessment Heading assessment is important for understanding dispersal and migration properties, not least from epidemiological aspects of economic and medical entomology. It can be accomplished in radar by polarisation anisotropy56, beam wobbling or tracking57. In optics heading can be assessed by quadrant detectors13,26,58, heading could also be inferred by transit times33 or even and odd harmonics43 however specular contributions from wings deviates from this model28.
3.5 Tracking individuals Reported entomological lidar studies typically report single timings and positions of many individuals, whereas tracking approaches report many timings and positions of a single individual. Tracking radar ornithology is widespread57 whereas report from radar entomology are limited55. In optics efficient tracking can be accomplished by static passive systems23,59, although active lock-in servo systems have been reported60.
4. Doppler assessment of movements Movements of animals and their bodypart may yield small shift in backscatter photon energy, this have been demonstrated with weather radars61 and micro Doppler radar technology62. The reports on applications of widespread Doppler lidars are limited63.
4. Conclusion, challenges and outlook
We have revised the development of entomological lidar instrumentation and compared it to radar. We have demonstrated aspects of modulation signatures, dual band and polarimetric insect scattering. We have discussed various types of studies and outcome. A current challenge is that there are no table values for scatter cross sections of the millions of insect species. Entomological lidar scientists should be encouraged to calibrate and standardize cross sections for comparison and not report arbitrary units. Future work could benefit from improved reference measurement, and linking lidar recording both to modulation spectroscopy50 and museum 3D insect libraries64.
