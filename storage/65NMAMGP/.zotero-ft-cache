Ran into some problems using MySQL on Dreamhost as the online database manager for my web2py PestList app . Decided to upgrade the database to postgresql. DreamHost doesn't support pg, so I had to revert to running pg on localhost. After several attempts to convert the MySQL tables to pg , I came across pgloader , which did the trick. I simply created an empty pg database and ran the following command.

  $ pgloader mysql://user:pass@mysql.guaminsects.net/pestlist postgresql://user:pass/localhost/import_test

    MySQL
    pgloader
    postgresql
    web2py
