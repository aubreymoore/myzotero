On August 18, 2006 Aubrey Moore and Bob Bourgeois injected a large flame tree outside the PeaceSat building in Dean's Cicle on the campus of the University of Guam. The PeaceSat radio station manager, Bruce Best, had requested that something be done about the flame tree loopers which annually defoliate this tree during the rainy season. After defoliating the tree, hordes of caterpillars wander into the building and cause damage to radio and computer equipment. Twenty-four Mauget injectors, each containing 2 ml of ABACIDE2 (2% abamection), were applied to the tree. On the day of treatment, we did not see any eggs, larvae, pupae, or adults.

We revisited the tree on October 25, 2006 after noticing defoliation of flame trees on campus. Only a few branches on the treated tree showed signs of defoliation. In contrast, neighboring trees were severely defoliated and infested with larvae and pupae. Wandering caterpillars did not invade the radio station as they had done in previous years.

During December, the treated tree shed all of its leaves and remained bare until mid April, at which time it flowered. New foliage appeared during May.
