Mark-Release-Recapture
1. Trapped beetles are fed and allowed to rest for one week 2. Beetles which pass a laboratory Ô¨Çight test are marked
with a number 3. Marked beetles are released at the center of 31 pan
traps spaced 100m apart 4. About 20% of beetles have been recaptured 5. If wild beetles behave the same as marked beetles, we
can infer that pan traps catch about 20% of the wild population

Conclusions

Conclusions
1. Mass trapping using standard vaned-bucket pheromone traps did not result in population suppression. These traps catch only about 1% of the adult population.
2. Addition of breeding site material to the barrels under pan did not increase trap catch.
3. Our best pheromone trap is the a pan trap equiipped with cone and UVLED. It catches about 16X more rhino beetles per day than our standard vaned bucket traps.
4. Covering breeding sites with Ô¨Åsh netting may be eÔ¨Äective for population suppression: traps adults attracted to the pile and prevents emergence of adults from within the pile. Netted piles catch about 25X more rhino beetles per day than standard pheromone traps.
