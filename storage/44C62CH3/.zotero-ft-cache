ABSTRACT
Surveys for insects and mites were carried out in the Federated States of Micronesia and Palau and the results documented, together with those previously recorded. To assist the reader, the data are presented in two ways. The pests are arranged alphabetically together with their classification, common names and distribution within Micronesia. Distribution is further divided into: newly present; confirmation of a previously doubtful record; and 'presence suspected, but not verified. In a second listing, the crops are arranged in alphabetical order together with the insects and mites that attack them. The common names of the pests are given, with their distribution (as in the first listing) and a note on the part or parts of the plant attacked. In total, more than 50 hosts are listed (some collectively by family), and 359 insects and mites are recorded as pests on them.
In addition to the survey and the documentation of all the insects and mites recorded in Micronesia, the paper gives detailed information on the biology and control of selected pests. In this section, the use of natural enemies as biological control is emphasised. A separate section deals with pesticides. It provides recommendations on formulation, concentration and withholding periods for the chemicals suggested for the control of pal1icular pests.
Comments are made on the facilities and equipment in the two countries and the expel1ise available to cany out plant protection activities. Improvements are suggested, as well as the introductions of beneficial insects that should be given priority to control the major pests.
Numerous insects have entered the two countries in recent years, including beetles, bugs, butterflies, leafminers, moths, thrips, and many scale insects and mealybugs. Many are potentially very serious pests. Some a1'e not yet widespread, but are likely to extend their range, as there are no controls preventing their movement between islands. In this connection, the survey shows which insects have extended their distribution from the time they were first introduced. No new specics of fruit flies were found, however.
It is concluded that in order to halt the pace of new pests moving into the Federated States of Micronesia and Palau, revised quarantine regulations need to be enacted and applied equitably to all travellers. Also, quarantine personnel should be trained in pest recognition. They should be able to identify the major pests in their respective countries as well as those to which their countries (and states) are vulnerable.

Des etudes de prospection ont ete realisees pour repertorier les insectes et acariens presents dans les Etats federes de Micronesie et II Palau et les resultats obtenus ont ete ajoutes II ceux des inventaires et recensements precedents. Pour en faciliter la lecture, les donnees ont ete presentees selon deux modes differents de classification. Une premiere liste classe les ravageurs par ordre alphabetique en donnant les especes, les noms usuels et les aires de repartition de ces especes en Micronesie. La partie correspondant aux aires de repartition est subdivisee en trois categories selon que Ie ravageur est nouvellement apparu, que sa presence est confirmee (apnls avoir precedemment fait I'objet d'observations non' verifiees) Oll que sa presence est soup90nnee mais non confirmee. Dans la deuxieme liste, les cultures sont classees par ordre alphabetique avec les noms usuels des ravageurs (insectes et acariens) qui les attaquent ainsi que leurs aires de repartition, comme dans Ie cas de la premiere liste, et une note concernant la partie ou les parties de la plante qui sont attaquees. Au total, plus de 50 plantes-hotes (dont certaines collectivement, par famille) figurent dans ces listes et 359 insectes et acariens sont signales comme ravagelirs de ces cultures.
Outre les resultats de I'inventaire des insectes et acariens presents en Micronesie, I'auteur communique des donnees detaill<les sur la biologie d'un celiain nombre de ravagems et les methodes de lutte utilisees pour les combattre. Dans ce chapitre, I'accent a ete mis sur la lutte biologique au moyen des predateurs nature Is de ces ravageurs. Un autre chapitre traite des pesticides; des recommandations pratiques y sont proposees sur la formulation chimique, les dosages et conditions d'emploi applicables aux produits utilises dans la lutte contre des insectes specifiques.
Des commentaires sont apportes sur les installations et Ie materiel ainsi que sur les services techniques dont disposent les deux pays pour mener II bien des activites de protection des vegetaux. Dans Ie contexte des ameliorations qui pourraient etre apportees, mention est faite de la lutte biologique qui devr3it constituer une priOl'ite et, II ce titre, de I'introduction de faune auxiliaire pour lutter contre les ravageurs les plus importants.
De nombreuses especes d'insectes sont apparues dans les deux pays au cours des dernieres annees, notamment des coleopteres, des punaises, des papillons, des mineuses, des thrips et une grande variete de cochenilles. Parmi ces ravageurs, iI en est beaucoup qui presentent potentiellement de tres graves risques phytosanitaires. Certains ne sont pas encore tres repandus mais pourraient etendre leur zone d'activite en raison de I'absence d'un contraIe phytosanitaire sur les echanges interinsulaires. L'etllde montre d'ailleurs I'evolution des aires de repartition des insectes depuis leur apparition sur les sites observes. On n'a toutefois signale la presence d'aucune nouvelle espece de mouche des fruits.
a a En conclusion, il est indispensable de proceder la revision et la mise en vigueur d'une reglementation
phytosanitaire qui s'applique equitablement II tous les voyageurs si I'on' veut ralentir Ie rythme de progression des nouveaux ravageurs dans les Etats federes de Micronesie et II Palau. Dans ces deux pays, les agents charges du contra Ie phytosanitaire devraient aussi suivre une formation leur penllettant de reconnaltre tant les ravageurs les plus importants qui sevissent dans leur pays respectif que ceux auxquels leur pays (et les differents Etats) sont vulnerables.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
The former Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TIPI) is now composed of new countries which are assuming administrative responsibilitics as befits their political status. The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is an independent country and is composed of four States, Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei and Kosrae. Each State has a Division of Agriculture, with separatc administrations. Palau is a Republic in a Compact of Free Association with the USA. It, too, has a Division of Agriculture as pmt of the Bureau of Resources and Development. Departments of plant and animal quarantine exist in both countries.
The FSM and Palau are seeking to develop their agricultural economies, both to increase internal production to promote self-sufficiency and to develop export markets. At the most recent national censuses, there were approximately 105,000 people in the FSM (1994) and 17,300 in Palau (1995).
The main food crops are bananas, breadfruit and taros. Cassava, coconuts, sweet potato and yams are also important staples. A variety of other vegetables and fruits are cultivated and eaten. Several crops, including bananas (Kosrae, Yap, Palau), breadfruit (Kosrae), citrus (Kosrae), papaya (Palau), taro and vanous vegetables are being grown for export to Guam or for trading with other islands within the region.
As part of their status as emerging nations, the FSM and Palau need to develop their own crop protection services. They need to be able to control their pest problems and to be able to supply information about whi<;h pests they have to countries interested in imp0l1ing agricultural items from them. They also need to be able to identify and develop control strategies for new pests when they appear and to develop inter-island quarantine regulations to contain important pests which are not uniformly distributed throughout the islands. The aim of the mission was to help develop expertise to conduct routine pest surveys, and to identify pest problems and the methods to control them.
In each administrative centre the mission was discussed and plans formulated with the personnel of the Department of Resources and Development (in Palau, the Bureau of Resources and Development). Together with the local pest management specialists or extension agents, visits were made to agricultural areas chosen by them. Collection techniques, specific identification of pests and control measures were discussed with these specialists. Each crop was searched for pests and all insects found were collected. Where fruit was available, it was collected and dissected to search for fruit flies. Where possible, identifications and control procedures for the insects were discussed at the site. The severity of the pest .problem was noted.
Information about the pests and control procedures is not included in the text for the most part, but is placed in Section 6 towards the end of the report. Insecticide dose recommendations for specific pests are presented in Table I (Section 7). A listing of all pests known to occur in Micronesia I is given in Section 9 (listed alphabetically) and Section 10 (listed by crop). Pests of the Northern Mariana Islands .are included to facilitate quarantine decisions. The distribution of all pests for the various islands is given and species which are new to an island or for Micronesia are indicated.
1.2 Terms of reference
The terms of reference were as follows:
117e consultant will spend a total ()( six weeks ill the Federated States of Micronesia and Palall. His travel will be divided into hl'o parts:
- Part I: PollI/pei (J 0 days), Kosrae (7 days), ClllIllk (4 days);
I In the context of this report, the tenn 'Micronesia' refers only to the Republic of Palau, the federated States of Micronesia, the Territory of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Micronesia proper also includes Marshall Islands, Kiribati and Naun!.

Dialelll'Odes citrijolii should be monitored to see if it is likely to become a major pest.
UI/aspis citri is a serious pest on citrus. Valuable trees can be treated with insecticides until better biological control agents are identified. To prevent the movement of U. citri, citrus should not be moved from Pohnpei to other islands.
The establishment of EI/carsia?haitiel/sis for the control of the spiraling whitefly should be monitored to determine the degree of success.
The species of parasites of Liriomyz(t'trijolii present on Pohnpei should be determined.
An extension programme to inform growers about cultural control methods for the banana root borer, Cosmopolites sordidl/s, should be initiated.
A quarantine facility to serve the Federated States of Micronesia should be developed. A quarantine room is needed to screen and SOit biological control agents and host material. Plant/insect mass-rearing facilities should be considered, depending on biological control needs.
2.1.3 Kosrae State
Facilities and equipment are needed: space should be provided to rear insects, so that they can be sent for identification, and to work on field samples needing examination. An escape-proof box is required in which to open shipments of biological control agents. The station should maintain a small insect reference collection to assist in the recognition of pests that are present and those newly introduced. A binocular microscope, 6-40 times magnification, should be acquired, in addition to the compound microscope now present.
The increase in air traffic and associated movement of goods will increase the likelihood of new and major pests being introduced to the island. Quarantine needs to be rigorous and thorough. Aircraft boarding and inspection are necessary.
Lime fruit should be collected and dissected to see if Bactrocera Ji'allel/feldi is present. Newly hatched fruit 'fly larvae should be placed in ripe limes and oranges to see if they are able to successfully develop in these fruits.
2.1.4 Chl/I/k State
Encarsia smithi should be introduced to control the orange spiny whitefly, Alel/rocal/tlllls spil/ijerl/s.
A survey of species of coccinellids and parasitoids attacking the coconut scale, A~pidiotl/s destrl/ctor,. should be made. Additional species, effective elsewhere in Micronesia, should be introduced.
The wasp, Anabrolepis oceal/ica, should be impOited from Yap or Ulithi to control FlIrcaspis oceal/ica, the coconut red scale.
Facilities and equipment are needed: space should be provided to rear insects, so that they can be sent for identification, and to work on field samples needing examination. An escape-proof box is required in which to open shipments of biological control agents. The station should maintain a small insect reference collection to assist in the recognition of pests present and new introductions. A binocular microscope, 6-40 times magnification, should be acquired in addition to the compound microscope now present.
2.2 Palau
Consideration should be given to biological control of Nezara viridl/la (southern green stink bug) by introduction of the tachinid parasitoids, Trichopoda pennipes and T penl/ipes pilipes. and the egg parasite,

Another serious pest which has entered Palau recently is the diamondback moth, Plulella xyloslella. It was found in cabbage and Chinese cabbage plantings on Babeldaob. This species can rapidly develop resistance to insecticides and requires careful pest management.
A number of species of scales and whiteflies have extended their distributions within the Caroline Islands or were found in Micronesia for the first timc. In p3lt, the movement is due to the lack of regulations concerning movements of plant material between islands. The orange spiny whitefly, Alellrocalllhlls spilliferlls, has extended its range from Chuuk, where it was first reported prior to 1950, to Yap and Pohnpei. It has also been repOlted from Kosrae, where it was the target of a successful biological control programme. On Yap, Chuuk and Pohnpei, biol.ogical control efforts are needed to control the outbreaks. On Kosrae it continues to be under good control by Ellcarsia slIIilhi. Two other whiteflies, AlellrodiclIs disperslIs and Dialellrodes cilrifolii, have also entered the Carolines. A. disperslIs was abundant on Palau and Pohnpei, but has not reached the other islands. Biological control introductions have already been made on both these islands. D. cilrifolii is new to Micronesia and, at the time of the survey, was present only in the Kolonia area on Pohnpei.
Some of the new records for scales and mealybugs are: Aslerolecallilllll ba;i,bllsae and Parlaloria zizyphlls in Chuuk; Ceroplasles rubells, EllcalYlllllallls lessellallls, Lepidosaphes gloverii and Villsollia slellifera in
v: Yap; Phellacocclls lIIadeirellsis in Chuuk and Pohnpei; and Saisselia neglecla in Pohnpei. slellifera and
COCCIIS viridis were previously repOlted as new records in Kosrae. A scale which may be Lepidosaphes lalerochitillosa was found in Pohnpei and Yap. This scale is virtually identical to L. similis and DJ. Williams was unable to positively identify it as L. lalerochilillosa. which previously has been reported only from the Mariana Islands and Palau.
Some other new records are: CIIIJ,sodeixis chalciles, the green garden looper, from Palau; Agonoxena pyrogralllllla, the coconut flat moth, from Chuuk and Pohnpei; Badalllia exc/alllalionis, the myrobalan butterfly, from Palau; Bracllyplatys inslliaris, the black island stink bug, from Yap, Pohnpei and Kosrae; Coplosollla X(lIIlllOgralllllla, the black stink bug, from Kosrae; Olllreis fitllonia from Palau, Pohnpei and Kosrae (on Kosrae the moth was previously repOlted by R. Muniappan in 1982); Melriolla circlIllldala, the green tortoise beetle, from Yap and Pohnpei; Penicillaria jocosalrix, the mango shoot caterpillar from Chuuk and Pohnpei; PericYllla cruegeri from Palau; Prolllisla 1II0esla from Pohnpei (collected by N. Esquerra); and Selellolhrips rubrocincllls from Palau, Yap and Chuuk. Oxya IIyla, the smaller rice grasshopper, was found on Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei and Kosrae, and 0. japonica, the Japanese grasshopper, was found on Palau. These grasshoppers have probabiy been on these islands for a long time, but have not been reported previously.
There appeared to be no changes in the fruit fly fauna. Baclrocera fmuenfeldi was found on all of the islands visited and B. IIl11broSIlS was found on Palau. No other fruit flies were found.
It is unlikely that the list of new introductions for Micronesia is complete. The visits to each island were nO.t long enough to survey all crops thoroughly. The introduction of pests into Micronesia and their subsequent movement between islands of the region reflects the status of quarantine. Recently revised quarantine regulations need to be enacted and applied uniformly to all travellers. Improvements in quarantine procedures and the training of officers in the recognition and detection of scales and other small a1thropods are essential. Some training in pest management was done during this consultancy, but no training was given to quarantine officers in pest recognition, and this is clearly needed. Photographs of pests of quarantine concern would enhance the training effort and should be considered a high priority by State officials.
A complete list of new pests and the crops they attack, as well as an island-by- island list of other insects previously recorded from the Carolines, are given in Sections 9 and 10. These lists will be helpful to the different islands and nations. They are considered to be incomplete, and local pest management officers should add to them by collecting pests with which they are not familiar and sending them for identification.

The pumpkin beetle, Alliacophora similis, is a serious problem in the southern and central pm1 of Yap on various species of cucurbits. Severe damage to cucumber and some damage to pumpkin was observed. The adult beetles feed on the leaves, flowers, and surfaces of fruits of a wide variety of cucurbits, including cucumber, cantaloupe, watermelon, squash, gourds and pumpkin. The larvae live in the soil and feed on the roots of these plants, killing them before fruits are harvcsted. The larvae may also feed on fruits where they are in contact with the ground. The insecticide carbaryl is very effective for controlling these beetles. Weekly treatments, stm1ing at the seedling stage, are needed.
An unknown species of bagworm was found feeding on the undersurface of banana leaves. No previous records of this species exist for Yap and as no' adults were obtained, the pest remains unidentified. It is a large species, about 4 cm long, with a case constructed of pieces of banana leaf. The moth was heavily parasitised. Out of 12 cases opened, 10 had been attacked by a tachinid fly. The bagworm appeared similar to a species attacking banana on Pohnpei. Damage caused by the bagworm was minor. Less than 1-2 per cent of the leaf tissue was affected. Given the high rate of parasitisation, additional control is not warranted. EffOl1s should continue to obtain the identity of the species.
Aspidiotlls destrllctor was abundant on a wide variety of plants, including banana, betel nut, coconut and papaya. Infestations were severe in many cases. This species is readily controlled by several coccinellids and is also attacked by several wasps, including Aphytis cill),solllphali. [mpOl1ant coccinellids are Te/silllia lIitida, a species native to the Mariana Islands, PselldoscYllllllls allollla/lls and Chi/ocorlls lIigritlls. The combination of these three species is providing excellent control of A. destrllctor in the Mariana Islands. Other species are available elsewhere (see Section 6.6). None of these coccinellids were found on Yap during the visit. More intensive surveys to check for the presence of these natural enemies should be made. Serious consideration should be given to impOl1ing natural enemies.
The weevil, Aclees porOSllS, was found boring breadfruit twigs. This weevil has been present on Yap since at least 1947 (Pembel1on, 19S4).lt is widespread, abundant and of concern to Yap officials, but whether or not it causes yield loss is uncel1ain. One of the breadfruit trees examined appeared to have significant damage, others did not. The pest status of this insect needs to be cxamined in more detail.
The only fruit fly found on Yap was BaCirocera frallellfeldi. No fruit flies were found in guava, orange or lemon. During the visit a single trap was hung undcr the eaves inside the airpOl1 terminal. More extensive trapping is needed. Traps need to be purchased or made' and set up near fruit trees, on farms, as well as in the vicinity of the airpOl1.
Sweet potatoes are widely grown and are an impOl1ant staple on Yap. Cy/as fOI'lI/icarills is present, but is not a serious problem. The two cultural practices in use-slash and burn and hilling-up--are maintaining populations of the weevil at low levels.
The green tortoise beetle, lYletriolla circllllldata, is present on Yap. The adult is small and bright green. The larvae are green and cany their cast skins on their backs. 80th the adults and the larvae feed on ihe leaves of the sweet potato. This beetle is a relative newcomer to Yap, but was not abundant at the time of the survey and was calIsing little damage.
(b) Weeds
There are three weeds of concern on Yap: Lalltalla call1ara. an unidentified vine and Chrolllo/aella odorata. Lantana is widespread along roadways and in savanna areas. This weed has been slIccessfully controlled by a variety of insects in the rest of Micronesia.
An unidentified vine was covering large areas of agricultural land in southern Yap. It was growing over banana, coconut and other crops. Yap officials should get this weed identified and determine if it is a suitable candidate for biological control.

9
At the College of Micronesia a small reference collection of local insects is being assembled. Proper storage facilities and equipment were lacking at the time of the visit, but were being obtained. Collecting equipment, other than nets and killing jars, was lacking. Additional collecting equipment, including black lights, and reference material for insect identification, would enhance the development of the reference collection and increase the ability of the station to detect insects new to the island.
At the Division of Agriculture a room has been designated for pest management. It is large enough to meet the needs of the station. Little equipment is present. Dissecting and compound microscopes are available, but they cannot be stored properly. Construction of a drying cabinet would help reduce mould growth on lenses and extend the useful life of the microscopes. No facilities for multiplication or post-entry quarantine of biological control agents are available. These need to be developed, since the Division of Agrieulture and the College of Micronesia will have biological control responsibilities for the Federated States of Micronesia.
4.2.2 Persollllei
Pest management activities are split between the College of Micronesia and the Division of Agriculture. Areas of responsibility were not well defined. The Division of Agriculture is engaged in extension activities in pest management, a role which is also being developed by the College of Micronesia. The College is also developing a research programme and has an entomologist, Dr Nelson Esquerra, on its staff. At the Division of Agriculture, Mr William William and Mr Aluis Ehpel share pest management responsibilities.
4.2.3 lv/ajor pests
Tarophaglls prose/pilla was abundant on new varieties of taro being evaluated at the Agricultural Station for introduction to Pohnpei. In taro patches in villages, agroforestry areas and farms, the taro leafllOpper was uncommon and not a problem. As pal1 of the evaluation of any new crop or variety, the susceptibility of the plant to local pests should be tested, along with agronomic characteristics. Aphis gossypii was also abundant on taro at the station, but was uncommon elsewhere.
Mr. A. Ehpel found adults of the weevil, A/ac/us depialla/lIs, chewing irregular holes in the leaves of Cyr/o;perllla at one site near Kolonia. This weevil is native to Pohnpei. The level of damage was not sufficient to affect yield and control was not necessary.
At the same site, Cyr/osperllla corms were reported to be damaged by an unknown pest. On corms, scalloped areas and holes were present, but no insect pests were found. The d3mage was consistent with that caused by a nematode, possibly Radophoius sill/ilis, rep0l1ed from Yap by G.Y.H. Jackson. More information is contained in his duty-tour rep0l1s (18 May-18 June 1986).
The only fruit fly found on Pohnpei was Bac/rocerajrallelljeldi.
Me/riolla circlIlI/da/a was found infesting sweet potatoes in the area around Kolonia. On one farm, damage to the leaves was thought sufficient to cause yield loss of tubers. This insect is a new record on Pohnpei.
Scales, mealybugs and whiteflies were causing problems on several plants on Pohnpei. On citrus; Aiellrocall/hlls spillijeJ'/ls, Diaieurodes ci/rijoiii, Paria/oria zizyphlls and Ullaspis cifri were present. The leaves were coated with sooty mould growing on the honeydew excreted by these pests. A. spillijeJ'/ls entered Pohnpei about 1980 and has now spread throughout the island. Many trees are severely infested with this whitefly. Biological control was successful on Kosrae using the wasp, Ellcarsia slllifhi, and it should be taken to Pohnpei.
At several locations the scale, Ullaspis cifri, was abundant on bark. It was heavily parasitised. This scale is present on Pohnpei, but not elsewhere in Micronesia.

II
Tetrastichus brolltispae, has been used successfully to control related species of Brolltispa on Guam and Chuuk. If this species is not already present on Pohnpei, it could be introduced.
4.2.4 Recommelldatiolls
Aleurocallthus spillijerus is damaging citrus throughout Pohnpei. Biological control of this species should be initiated using thc wasp, Ellcarsia smithi.
The whitefly, Dialeurodes citrijolii, needs to be monitored to see if it is going to be a serious problem. If it is, biological control should be considered.
Ullaspis citri is infesting and damaging citrus in some areas. Several biological control agents are known for this species, but none have been effective where they have been introduced. Additional research on biological control agents is needed. The effectiveness of parasites and predators already on Pohnpei should be investigated, since the scale is not a problem in all areas of the island. If there are effective natural enemies, management practices to conserve them should be developed.
Valuable trees can be treated with insecticides or oil until better biological control agents are identified. This scale is present only on Pohnpei, in Micronesia. Citrus should not be transferred from Pohnpei to other islands, to prevent the movement of this pest. The scale will sometimes occur on fruit, although it is normally found on bark and twigs.
The spiraling whitefly was a serious pest on guava and several other plants at the time of the visit. Ellcarsia?haitiellsis has been released and is successfully controlling the whitefly. Its effect on the whitefly population should be monitored. Islands adjacent to the main island should be checked for the presence of the whitefly and the parasite introduced, if necessary.
Parasites of Liriomyza trijolii should be reared and sent for identification. The leafilliner is currently not a serious pest because the preferred host plants are not yet extensively grown. Should the amount of beans or other leafminer-susceptible crops increase, additional biological control agents may be needed.
An education programme about cultural controls for the banana corm weevil, Cosmopolites soulidus, should be initiated. Farmers should be careful not to use infested material. Currently, the weevil is not widespread and the most likely method of dispersal will be infested planting material. Cultivation and maintenance practices should be improved.
Since Pohnpei is the seat of the Federated States of Micronesia National Government and an entomologist is stationed there, a national quarantine facility should be developed. The facility does not need to be elaborate or expensive. A room or set of rooms will be adequate to serve the needs of the country at this time. At a minimum, the facility should be capable of receiving biological control agents and screening them to ensure they are released without their hosts or hyperparasites. In addition to the room, sealed box~s for opening insect consignments and sealed rearing boxes would be needed. Screened biological control agents could then be transferred to other destinations in the Federated States of Micronesia or reared for mass release. Additional facilities to multiply natural enemies could also be considered (screen houses for growing plants and screened areas for rearing host insects).
4.3 Kosrae State
4.3.1 Facilities alld equipmellt
There is a small experiment station in Lelu. No entomology facilities are available. Attempts to start a collection failed due to inadequate facilities to store insects. The department has a compound microscope, but does not have a binocular dissecting microscope. If pest management is to be done, a 6-40 times binocular dissecting microscope should be acquired and space for pest management should be allocated.

4.4 Chuuk State
Agriculh.ral activities in Chuuk State are mostly for subsistence. A wide variety of starch crops, vegetables and fruits are grown. Banana, breadfruit, cassava, sweet potatoes mid taro are staples. Farms on the outer islands supply Weno with fresh produce.
4.4.1 Facilities alld eqllipmell/
There are no laboratory facilities.
4.4.2 Persollllel
Mr Hermes Refit has been assigned pest management responsibilities.
4.4.3 Major pests
The orange spiny whitefly was first recorded in Micronesia from Chuuk. The whitefly was widespread on Weno and Fefan at the time of the mission. Counts of over 200 live nymphs and pupae per leaf were found. There was no evidence of parasitisation. Ellcarsia smithi should be introduced to control the outbreak.
The scale, Parlatoria zizyphlls, was found infesting a citrus tree on Weno. This is the first record of this scale for Chuuk.
Aspidiotlls destructor was infesting breadfruit in moderately high numbers. At the time of the visit, populations were not high enough to warrant control, but local officials reported that it is sometimes more abundant, pm1icularly in the dry season. Efforts to import biological control agents, principally' lady beetles, have been made in the past, but were apparently unsuccessful. Parasites would be imported or certain coccinellids re-imported. Te!esmia lIitida, Pseudoscymllus allomalus and Chilocorus lIigritus have all been previously collected on Chuuk. Azya trillitatis, CiJ'Ptogalltha lIodiceps and Rhizobius satelles were released, but no information on their establishment is available. They were not found during the visit. The only coccinellid collected was C. nigritus. A more thorough· survey of the coccinellids and parasites present on Chuuk should be done before attempts to re-imp0l1 or iniport new species are made.
lvfetriolla circumdata, a relatively new immigrant to Chuuk, was common on sweet potato, but was not found in damaging numbers. The garden flea hopper, Halticus tibialis, was also abundant on sweet potato.
Plilvillaria lIrbicola was found on hot pepper and on tomato. It was not present in high enough numbers to be damaging. On beans, the aphid, Aphis craccivora, was common.
/sclmaspis IOllgirostris, the black thread scale, was abundant on mango on Weno. Although extremely numerous, it did not appear to be damaging the plants.
An unidentified bagworm was found feeding on taro near the dump. Damage was not high enough to affect yield. No adults were collected or reared, so it was impossible to identify the species. Local pest management specialists should rear the moth for identification.
Flircaspis oceallica, the coconut red scale, was abundant on many of the coconuts on Weno. The undersurfaces of leaves were encrusted with scales and the leaves were yellow. This species is native to Micronesia and is heavily parasitised by the wasp, Allabrolepis oceanica, in Yap and Ulithi, where the scale is very rare. The scale should be surveyed to determine if the parasite is present on Chuuk. If not, it should be imported. Care should be taken in doing this as a hyperparasite is present in Yap and Ulithi.
The hibiscus mealybug, lvfacollellicocclls hirslltlls, was abundant and damaging on hibiscus on Chuuk. It can be controlled with malathion (see recommendations for Ferrisia virgata, Section 6.16).

5.3 Major pests
There are several major pest problems on Palau. Currently, the agricultural sector is dominated by subsistence agriculture, but commercial production is rapidly developing. A number of fresh fruits and vegetables are being grown and sold to hotels. These crops have several serious pest problems and new problems arc continuing to appear. Important new pests, including the spiraling white fly, A/eurodjcus dispersus, the diamondback moth, P/ulella xy/oslella, and the melon thrips, Thrips palmi, have become established in Palau in the last five years.
The diamondback moth was found infesting Chinese cabbage and head cabbage at two locations on Babeldaob, at OISCA and Imul. It was not present at any of the other sites visited. Damage was moderate, but reported to be severe at times.
Au/acophora simi/is (orange cucumber beetle) was causing severe damage on cucumber and melons on farms in Ochelochel, Babeldaob. At one farm, it was defoliating the cucumbers. This insect is a major problem and needs to be controlled with insecticides. Untreated, infested. crops will often be completely destroyed. No biological control agents of importance are known.
Nezara viridu/a (southern green stink bug) was damaging tomatoes in Imul (a loss in yield of 50-75 per cent was estimated) and cucumbers were attacked on several farms on Babeldaob. Biological control of this insect is strongly recommended. This species is under excellent biological control in other areas, although the primary agents responsible, the tachinid parasitoids, Trichopoda pel/I/ipes and T pel/I/ipes pilipes, are not host-specific. They are currently being reared by the Hawaii Department of Agriculture and could be obtained there. In addition to the southern green stink bug they also attack other species of pentatomids and core ids. The Hawaii Depaltment of Agriculture is alelt to the issue of their effect on native species and could give advice on this problem. The egg parasite, Trisso/cus basalis, has provided excellent control in other areas and should also be considered as a biological control agent, but serious attention should be given to its impact on non-target, native, pentatomids. T basalis is known to heavily parasitis'e several other species of pentatom ids and it could potentially reduce or eradicate native species on Palau. In pmticular, this species attacks Co/eolichus species, which are impOitant members of the native stinkbug fauna in Micronesia. T basalis can be obtained from the biological control unit at Davis, California. Local officials should contact Dr L.E. Ehler, Department of Entomology, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA, for a supply.
The spiraling whitefly is a new pest in Palau. The parasite, EI/carsia?hailiel/sis, was sent to Palau and released in the Koror area. It has established, and at the time of the mission had reduced the whitefly population to non-significant levels in the release areas. The spiraling whitefly was still a problem, howevcr, in surrounding areas and on outlying islands. Pest management specialists should check for newly established populations of the spiraling whitefly and should move the parasite to these areas to speed up the biological control process.
Helicoverpa sp. and Spodoplem Iilw'a were found feeding on tomato fruit and causing extensive damage on farms in Imul. Comments on the description and control of these species are given in Sections 6.17 and 6.31 respectively.
Two fruit flies, Baclrocem jmuel/jeldi and B. IImbroslIs, were found in Palau. B. jrallel/je/di has been in Micronesia a long time and occurs on most of the islands, with the notable exception of Guam. B. umbrasus is found only on Palau. Both species are of quarantine significance. However, two fruit flies, B. clicw'bilae and B. ochrosiae, are present on Guam and are of major quarantine significance to Palau.
The bean fly, Ophiomyia phaseo/i, was found on farms in the Ochelochel area, but the damage was light and under control at the time of the visit. This insect has previously been recorded from Palau.

17
Chemical control is impractical, although malathion emulsion sprayed on the lower side of the leaf may give good results. Both moths are adequately controlled by parasites. Surveys in Fiji, for instance, have recorded 70 per cent parasitism in larvae and 50 per cent in pupae. On Guam, A. pyrogramma larvae are parasitised by J\1acrocelllrllS pallidlls, and the pupae by Brachymeria hammari.
6.2 AlellrOC(llllllllS spillijerlls - orange spiny whitefly
The adult has an orange-yellow body shaded with brownish-purple and sprinkled with white, waxy, powder. The outer wings are smoky coloured. The immature stages are the most conspicuous. They are found underneath the leaves of citrus, grape, pear, persimmon, rose and palm trees. They are black, spiny, insects which are egg-shaped and flat. There is a row of spines around the perimeter and several spines on top. A fringe of white, waxy, secretions extends outward from the edge of the body.
The immature stages feed on sap and reduce the vitality of trees. Honeydew accumulates on the upper surface of the leaves and sooty mould grows on it and blocks photosynthesis. Reduced fruit yield is common from heavy infestations.
The best method of control is with the parasitoids, Ellcarsia smilhi and Amillls hesperidllm. These have provided excellent control on Guam, and E. smilhi has controlled the whitefly on Kosrae.
6.3 Alellrodiclls disperslls - spiraling whitefly
The spiraling whitefly attacks over 100 plant species, including many fruit trees and ornamentals. Some preferred plants are coconut, guava, P/llmeria and sea grape. The adult whitefly is a small, dusty-white insect resembling a tiny moth. Commonly, adults are found on the undersurface of leaves together with the immature stages. The nymphs are small, white insects covered with waxy secretions. Long, curving, white threads extend beyond the shining white wax. The eggs are laid on the undersurface of ,leaves in a characteristic spiral pattern which gives the whitefly its name.
Whiteflies can be extremely abundant and can cover the entire lower surface of leaves. They feed on sap, reduce plant vigour and on fruit trees may reduce yield. They also make the plants unsightly by secreting honeydew on which sooty mould forms a black crust.
The ladybird beetle, Nepha.lpis oCII/allls. and the wasp, Encarsia?hailiellsis, give good control. Home owners can reduce damage from the whitefly by keeping their plants healthy (fertilizing and watering as needed) and by pruning dense foliage to lessen the amount of shelter for the whiteflies. Ifinsecticides are necessary, malathion can be used. Care should be taken to prevent the spread of this insect. People should understand that taking plants from one island to another will spread the insect.
6.4 Aphis craccivora - cowpea aphid
This species is polyphagous, but is mainly found on legumes. The adult is large, u{' to 2 n1l11 long, black or brown with dark cornicles. The nymphs are also dark and have a roundish body.
The aphid can be extremely numerous on yard-long and Phaseo/lls beans and in hot, dry weather plants may wilt. Plants can usually tolerate large numbers of aphids and treatment is rarely needed unless virus diseases are present. This aphid is known to transmit at least 14 viruses.
Populations are generally kept under control by natural enemies. Control can also be obtained with carbaryl or dimethoate insecticides.
6.5 Aphis gossypii - melon aphid
The melon aphid is polyphagous, commonly found on citrus, cucumbers, eggplant, numerous legumes, melons and taro. Adults are yellow to dark green with a black head and black cornicles. They occur on the

19
6.9 Bactrocera IImbroslls - breadfruit fruit fly
This fruit fly is brown and yellow, but has more yellow than B. jrallenjeidi. The thorax is black with two yellow stripes; the abdomen is predominantly brown. The wings have three broad, brown bands crossing them rather than the two, narrow dark bands of B. frallenjeidi. The larva is a yellow maggot which feeds inside the fruit of breadfruit, jackfruit and passionfruit. Hill (l983) lists it as a major pest of jackfruit and passionfruit in South-East Asia. Hardy (1973) also lists it from bitter melon (Molllordica charantia). It is strongly attracted to methyl eugenol.
This fruit fly is not widely distributed in Micronesia, being found only in Palau. Elsewhere, it is found in Indonesia, Malaysia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. It is not reported from Hawaii or the mainland USA and may be of quarantine significance there, and to those islands in Micronesia where it is absent.
6.10 Brontispa c/wiybeipellnis - Pohnpei coconut leaf beetIe
The adult is a slender, flattened, beetle about 10 mm long and 2 mm wide. It is metallic green with two brown spots at the tip of the elytra. The larva is white with a brownish cast. It is flattened and has a pair of pincer-like protuberances at the rear. Two other closely related species are found in Micronesia: B. paiallensis, dark with a metallic blue sheen, and B. lIIarialla, which is brown.
The larvae and adults feed on the unopened spear leaf, producing long, brown tracks parallel to the midrib. Heavily infested leaves d,y out and have a ragged, scorched appearance. Young palms are more susceptible to attack, p3l1icularly those surrounded by dense undergrowth. Growth of young palms can be severely affected and, occasionally, they may be killed, as the stress from heavy infestations of Bronlispa weakens them and makes them more susceptible to disease, drought or other stresses.
Young palms should be kept free of tall weeds, and before they are planted they should be inspected to make sure they are without infestations 'of the leaf beetle. The beetle does not disperse well, as it flies poorly, but it is frequently moved by people in seedlings or on cut fronds. Carb3lyl can be applied to the crown to give control. Varieties differ in resistance: coconuts from South-East Asia, including Federated Malay States and Malayan red and yellow dwarf, m;e susceptible and should not be used. There may be some varieties from Yap which are resistant. A good planting practice is to use seedlings from coconuts which are free of damage. A parasite, Telraslichlls brolltispae, has been widely used for control of related beetles and has recently been used against this species in Hawaii.
6.11 Cosmopolites sordidlls - banana root borer
The weevil is brown or black with a pronounced curving snout. It is about 10 mm long. The larvae are large, white, legless grubs. Eggs are laid singly in small cavities in the pseudostem near the ground.
Adults feed on dead or dying banana plants and do not disperse readily, as they seldom fly. The larvae tunnel through the rhizomes, leaving a trail filled with brown or black debris. Infested plants are weak and growth is slow. Bunches are small or absent. Heavily infested plants are more likely to be blown over in storms. Susceptible or ve,y young plants can be killed.
Most outbreaks start from planting infested suckers. Cultural control is important. Only rhizomes free of beetles should be used as propagating material. In order to achieve this, the pseudostem and rhizome should be cleaned of all old leaves, roots and debris, carefully inspected for tunnels made by larvae and then dipped in 5 per cent chlorox solution. Harvested stems should be removed, preferably by cutting them below ground, and the remaining p0l1ion of the stem covered with soil. It is imp0l1ant that the stems are not left as a source of food for adults, and to prevent this, they are best cut into 60 cm lengths so that they dry rapidly.
The predatory histerid beetle, Piaesills javalllls. has been introduced as a biocontrol agent to several countries.

21 6.15 Ellilocilllajllllollia - fruit-piercing moth

The fruit-piercing moth, Eltdocillla (O/hreis) jilllollia, is large, with brown, patterned, front wings and orange hind wings on which a crescent-shaped black spot is present. The hind wings are covered when the moth is resting, so the striking orange and black pattern is not visible. The larvae arc black with red and yellow markings. They feed on ElJ,/hrilla and are not pests of economic impOitanee.

The adults suck juices from a wide variety of fruits, including citms, eggplant, guava, mango, papaya, pomegranate and tomato. The moth makes a round, pinhead-size hole in ripe fmits; a small cavity is left, through which rot-causing organisms enter the fruit. The moth feeds at night.

The moth is difficult to control with insecticides because it spends only a short time on the fruit and does not breed on the crops attacked. Bagging the fruit shortly before it ripens is a solution, but this is costly. Destruction of EIJ,/hrilla could reduce the moth populations, but is not likely to be a practical consideration. Fruit-piercing moths are repelled by strong lights. Lights should be placed at a height of 1.75 m, at 12-20 m intervals, downwind of plants to be protected. Kerosene pressure lamps may be used if electricity is not available.

6.16 Ferrisia virga/a - striped mealyhug

The adult female is covered with powdery-white wax and has a pair of purplish dorsal stripes. Long, glossy

white, wax threads extend from the body and there are two long tails. The mealybug attacks a wide variety

of hosts, including cocoa, cassava, citrus, coffee, guava and sweet potato. It is common on tomatoes and

eggplants, particularly on water-stressed plants. It feeds on the leaves, shoots, fruits and will move on to the

roots in dry weather. It can get under the calyx of fruits and cause scarring. This can be a serious problem in

eggplant. Like most scales and mealybugs, it can occur in great numbers.

.

If chemical control is necessary, malathion can be used. The usc of a sticker/spreader, at twice the normal rates, is very impOitant when using insecticides, because of the need to penetrate the wax which covers the body.

6.17 Helicoverpa arllligera - old wodd bollworm

The tomato fruitwonn is a stout-bodied, brownish to brownish-green moth. The larvae are green or brown caterpillars with a dark stripe down the sides. There are no black spots above the stripe as in Spodop/era Ii/lira. The colour of the larva varies in response to that of the host plant.

The larvae feed on fruits of beans, bell peppers, corn, tomatoes or in the 'heads' of cabbage. They also eat cotton, sorghum, tobacco and many weeds. In corn, they feed on the kernels at the tip of the 'ear'. In tomato and bell pepper, they make holes in the fruit and rots develop. This moth is considered one of the world's most serious pests.

There are resistant varieties of cotton and corn. Corn varieties with tight slleaths suffer less damage. No resistance is known for bell peppers or tomatoes. Hot peppers are not attacked. Insecticides are used mostly for control. Carbatyl is often recommended, but is not very effective. Pyrethroids and acephate are useful. A large number of natural enemies are known, but they will not keep moth popUlations low enough to prevent economic loss in vegetable crops where appearance is a consideration. A baculovirus is known for this species.

It is unclear whether or not H zeae is present in Micronesia. In recent years, only H arllligera has been found, although intensive searches have not been done.

23
6.22 Melriol/a circllllldalli - green tortoise beetle
This is a round beetle with an iridescent green and black pattel1l on the back. The larvae are green and cany their cast skins from previous instars curved above their backs. Both the adults and the larvae feed on the leaves of sweet potatoes and other related plants, such as morning glory. The feeding makes irregular holes in the leaves. Plants can be defoliated, but in most areas in Micronesia this pest is not VelY abundant and rarely causes appreciable damage. The beetles can be controlled with carbmyl, if necessary.
6.23 Nezarll viridlllll- southern green stink bug
The adult is a green bug about 25 mm long. The nymphs are similar in shape to the adults, but are smaller, withont wings, and black and red rather than green.
The bug feeds on a wide variety of plants, including beans, corn, cucumbers, melons, passionfruit, soybeans, tomatoes and, o~casionally, oranges. The softer parts of the plant are preferred, especially the seeds and fruits. Damage results from feeding punctures in the fruit or from the removal of seed contents. On corn, individual grains are emptjed. On tomatoes, green fruits are punctured, resulting in rotten spots or fruit drop. On beans, the pods are punctured and the devel.oping seeds are consumed. Feeding causes premature fruit drop, deformation, shrivelling or necrosis. Yield in soybeans and fresh beans can be seriously reduced. Pod fall, seed number, seed viability and pod size are affected. On cotton, the southern green stink bug is suspected of transmitting the fungus Nell/alospora, which causes the boll to rot.
Crop sanitation will help reduce pest numbers. Prompt removal of harvested crops will often destroy numerous bugs before they mature. Biological control can be very effective; for instance, the scelionid wasp, TrissolclIs basalis, successfully controlled the bug in Australia and on several Pacific islands, including Hawaii, Fiji and New Zealand. The bug is readily controlled by a variety of chemicals, including carbaryl and malathion.
6.24 Ophiolllyia plwseoli - bean fly
The bean fly is a small, black fly about 2-3 mm in length, often seen On bean leaves. It lays eggs singly on leaves near the petioles or leaf stalks of various bean species, including yard-long beans, pole beans and mung beans. The larvae are small, whitish, nearly transparent maggots with distinct, black mouth hooks. The larva tunnels in the stems or petioles, causing them to swell and crack and the leaves to drop prematurely. On seedlings, the larvae bore down the stem, sometimes as far as the tap root, and destroy the plants. Generally, these flies are more of a problem on seedlings than on mature plants.
When problems are experienced with this insect, overlapping crops of beans should be avoided and crop residues should be destroyed. Chemical control is effective and may be used, if necessary. Often, it is sufficient to spray just twice, 2 and 12 days after the seedlings emerge from the soi!. The parasitoids, Opills ill/porlallls (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and 0. phaseoli, were released in Hawaii and Guam to control this fly. There is no record of them establishing on Guam.
6,25 Pel/lalollia lIigrollen'o.WI - banana aphid
This is a distinctivc aphid which is reddish or black. The winged forms have dark bands along the veins, a characteristic which makes the aphid relatively easy to identify. The aphid feeds on banana, taro, tomato and several ornamental plants. On banana, the aphids can be found between the sheaths of the petioles. on fruit and at the base of the pseudostems, below soilleve!. Large populations of the aphids can stunt or kill young plants and honeydew accumulated near the base of the petiole can ferment and cause leaves to rot. Colonisation offruit can cause blemishes which reduce its market value.
The aphid is important as it is the vector of bunchy top virus, which produces a lethal disease in bananas. Infectcd plants are stunted with broken streaks of green on the veins, midribs and pctiolcs. Progressively smaller leaves are 'produced so that they appear bunched; they arc also brittle. Fruit production ceases or

25
This moth is resistant to many insecticides and this resistance develops rapidly. Since insecticide resistance is a serious problem, excessive or unnecessary use of chemicals must be avoided. Synthetic pyrethroids and the bacterial insecticide Dipel are currently recommended. Resistance to both these types of insecticides is possible and for this reason they should be used alternately. The caterpillars are located underneath the leaves, so the spray must be carefully applied to reach them. First instars mine the leaf and may escape treatment.
Harvested fields should be cleared of all cabbage plants. The old leaves on harvested plants should be removed, since these will supp0l1 moth populations. All unharvested plants should be ploughed under or destroyed in other ways. On farms where the moth is a problem, cabbages and related crops should not be grown continuously or the field should be left fallow for a time.
6.29 Prays spp. - citrus flower and rind moths
It is as yet uncertain which species of Prays are present in Micronesia. P. endocarpa was identified by Pembe.10n (1954) fi'om Guam. This is considered to be a misidentification by the author and should be removed from the list pending flll1her review. Damage to citrus in Yap is, however, characterisitic of that caused by P. endocarpa, but no specimens have been found.
A note in the Distribution Maps of Pests no. 512 (1990) published by the International Institute of Entomology (previously the Commonwealth Institute of Entomology) sums up the situation. It states that there has been confusion over the identification in South-East Asia and Australasia of P. endoca'1Ja and P. cill'i, and P. endocmpa and P. pyri. In map no. 443 (1982) of the same series no records for P. cilti in South-East Asia and Australasia are given, since it is assumed that P. cilri is not present. There is an urgent need, therefore, to discover what causes the damage to citrus in Yap, and to determine the species of Prays that are present in the Caroline and Mariana Islands.
6.30 Selellothrips rubrocillctus - red-banded thrips
The adults are dark brown, about I mm long. The nymphs a're yellow or white with a bright red band around the abdomen. They often carry a drop of reddish excrement on the tip of their upturned abdomen. These drops are periodically deposited on the leaf, where they form shiny black spots. Mangoes are an important host for this insect, as well as avocado, cacao, cashew and guava.
The insects feed on the underside of the leaf and occasionally on fruits. The lower surface of heavily infested mango leaves has a dark, rusty appearance with numerous, small, shiny black spots of excreta. Leaf edges may be curled. Seedlings can be severely damaged or killed. Older trees may lose their leaves premah.rely, although the thrips is usually not abundant on mature trees unless the trees are stressed.
Control is usually not necessary on adult trees. If mature trees are infested, phosphorus and potassium fertilizers are recommended to improve the health of the tree. Other control measures should not be needed. Seedling trees may be treated with carbaryl.
6.31 Spotloptera fitum - rice cutworm
This is a brown moth with patterned forewings and white hind wings that are somewhat transparent. The larvae are medium-sized caterpillars and vary in colour at different times in their life cycle. Young larvae tend to be blackish-green. Older larvae are grey and blackish-green, with yellow stripes on the sides and top and black spots above the stripes on the sides. They have black heads.
The larvae feed on the leaves or fruits of cabbage, cotton, rice, taro, tomato and many other plants. Crops can be defoliated, but this is rare in Micronesia, although individual plants may suffer considerable damage since egg masses are laid in clusters and the larvae feed gregariously for a time. The larvae will bore into the heads of cabbage or into the fruit of toma,toes. They also feed on taro leaves.

27
6.34 UIl{fspis cilri - citrus suow scale
The male scale is covered with a white, waxy, shell which has three distinct parallel ridges, resembl ing fingers pressed together. The female is grey, looks somewhat like a mussel shell and is inconspicuous even though it is larger than the male. The scale infests the bark of citrus, although it can be found on the leaves and fruit. If infestations are heavy, the tree may die from direct damage and from increased susceptibility to borers. In addition, infestations prevent normal expansion of the bark, causing it to split and pathogens to enter. Premature leaf drop occurs and fruits may be deformed and stunted. In Micronesia, the scale is found only on Pohnpei.
Various controls are possible. Carbaryl, diazinon or malathion with white oil are effective. Lime sulphur, sulphur or oils can also be used. Little attempt to use biological control for this scale has been made to date, but it should be possible as there are a large number of natural enemies. Aphylis lillgnanensis, Penlilia egena. Hyperaspis billoli. Chilocorus cacli and Exocholllus jourdallii have been introduced elsewhere. A. lillgnallellsis is the most commonly used, but its use has not resulted in any outstanding successes. Numerous other natural enemies exist, including predacious moths in Australia. An unknown parasite is present on the males in Pohnpei and most males examined had been attacked.

7. CHEMICAL CONTROL RECOMMENDATIONS
Suggestions for insecticide recommendations for pests are listed in the pest briefs above. Bjork and Bevacqua (1984) should be consulted for further advice. Some chemicals'are not registered in the USA for the uses suggested because the crop or the pest does not occur in that country. The author cannot authorise or assume responsibility for the use of any of these chemicals in the Federated States of Micronesia or Palau. Country officials should review the suggestions and decide which ones they will allow. In Palau, it is suggested that operators undergo the EQPB Chemical Application Program.
Bacillus Ihurillgiellsis, carbalyl, malathion and permethrin are the least toxic chemicals and should be the chemicals of choice. Because most of the chemicals used in the Federated States of Micronesia and Palau are imported from the USA, spray rates are listed on the container labels in Imperial measurements and not in metric units.
To avoid connlsion, the recommended doses are given in Table 2 in US gallons, tablespoons and teaspoons. Please note that tablespoons and teaspoons refer to US standard-volume measuring spoons and not to kitchen utensils. Kitchen tablespoons and teaspoons are not standardised in volume and must not be used to measure volumes for pesticides. A conversion chaIt which can be used by those who need to convert to metric can be found at the foot of Table 2.
