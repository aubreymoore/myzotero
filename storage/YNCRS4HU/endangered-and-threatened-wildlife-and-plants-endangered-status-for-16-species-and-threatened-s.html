  This site displays a prototype of a “Web 2.0” version of the daily
  Federal Register. It is not an official legal edition of the Federal
  Register, and does not replace the official print version or the official
  electronic version on GPO’s Federal Digital System (FDsys.gov).
</p>

<p>
  The documents posted on this site are XML renditions of published Federal
  Register documents. Each document posted on the site includes a link to the
  corresponding official PDF file on FDsys.gov. This prototype edition of the
  daily Federal Register on FederalRegister.gov will remain an unofficial
  informational resource until the Administrative Committee of the Federal
  Register (ACFR) issues a regulation granting it official legal status.
  For complete information about, and access to, our official publications
  and services, go to the
  <a href="http://www.ofr.gov/" title="Office of the Federal Register">OFR.gov website</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The OFR/GPO partnership is committed to presenting accurate and reliable
  regulatory information on FederalRegister.gov with the objective of
  establishing the XML-based Federal Register as an ACFR-sanctioned
  publication in the future. While every effort has been made to ensure that
  the material on FederalRegister.gov is accurately displayed, consistent with
  the official SGML-based PDF version on FDsys.gov, those relying on it for
  legal research should verify their results against an official edition of
  the Federal Register. Until the ACFR grants it official status, the XML
  rendition of the daily Federal Register on FederalRegister.gov does not
  provide legal notice to the public or judicial notice to the courts.

          <p>
            We've changed the way we display documents to make them easier to read
            and to make document tools more readily available.
          </p>
          <p>
            Documents are now displayed in a single column and we've improved
            the display of tables and images within the documents.
          </p>
          <p>
            We've also added a utility bar that contains document tools, access
            to other formats, social media tools, etc. You can find this on
            the right hand side of published documents.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

          <img alt="Doc_preview" src="/assets/doc_preview-74436f54784932ae06fddaf2f45dcf34.png" />
        </div>
        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="api">
          <p>
            Everything on FederalRegister.gov now uses our API as its data
            source (with the exception of MyFR content). This is part of our ongoing
            commitment to maintain and expand our API.
          </p>

          <p>
            As part of this update we've added many more endpoints to our API
            to not only power FederalRegister.gov but also make it possible for
            external developers to do more. Take a look at our
            <a href="/developers/api/v1/">interactive documentation</a>
            to see these new endpoints.

Part</h6></div></div><div class="content-block ">
  <p>
    Agencies provide a heading for each part, subpart, section, and 
appendix that
    they are proposing to amend.

    The Amendment Part section identifies changes or additions to the 
CFR. The
    regulatory text of a document must fit into the current text of the 
CFR. It
    should precisely identify and describe the changes made to the CFR. 
The
    amendatory language uses standard terms to give specific 
instructions on
    how to change the CFR. It does not include a discussion of why the 
changes
    are made.

    If a document amends only certain sections within
    a CFR part, the authority citation for the part will set out as the 
first
    numbered item in the list of amendments for the part.

  <p>
    Stars are part of the published document. When an agency
    is adding or revising only
    certain units of a section, the amendatory language must
    state exactly which units are added or revised, and only
    those units are printed. Asterisks are used to represent
    text which is not changed.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>5 stars</strong> are used to show that a whole paragraph,
    including its subordinate paragraphs, is unchanged.

          <h2 id="h-8">Executive Summary</h2>
          <p id="p-8" data-page="59424">
            <em>Why we need to publish a rule.</em> Under the Endangered
 Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act or ESA), a species may warrant 
protection through listing if it is endangered or threatened throughout 
all or a significant portion of its range. Listing a species as an 
endangered or threatened species can only be completed by issuing a 
rule. Critical habitat shall be designated, to the maximum extent 
prudent and determinable, for any species determined to be an endangered
 or threatened species under the Act.</p>

          <p id="p-9" data-page="59424">This rule will finalize the listing of 23 species from the Mariana Islands as endangered or threatened species, one of which (<em>Cycas micronesica</em>)
 also occurs in the Republic of Palau and the Federated States of 
Micronesia (Yap). For the sake of brevity, throughout this document we 
refer to these 23 species simply as the 23 Mariana Islands species. 
Sixteen of these species are listed as endangered species: Seven plants—<em>Eugenia bryanii</em> (no common name (NCN)), <em>Hedyotis megalantha</em> (pau dedu, pao doodu), <em>Heritiera longipetiolata</em> (ufa halumtanu, ufa halom tano), <em>Phyllanthus saffordii</em> (NCN), <em>Psychotria malaspinae</em> (aplokating palaoan), <em>Solanum guamense</em> (Biringenas halumtanu, birengenas halom tano), and <em>Tinospora homosepala</em> (NCN); and nine animals—the Pacific sheath-tailed bat (Mariana subspecies, <em>Emballonura semicaudata rotensis;</em> payeyi, paischeey), Slevin's skink (<em>Emoia slevini;</em> gualiik halumtanu, gholuuf), Mariana eight-spot butterfly (<em>Hypolimnas octocula marianensis;</em> ababbang, libweibwogh), Mariana wandering butterfly (<em>Vagrans egistina;</em> ababbang, libweibwogh), Rota blue damselfly (<em>Ischnura luta;</em> dulalas Luta, dulalas Luuta), fragile tree snail (<em>Samoana fragilis;</em> akaleha dogas, denden), Guam tree snail (<em>Partula radiolata;</em> akaleha, denden), humped tree snail (<em>Partula gibba;</em> akaleha, denden), and Langford's tree snail (<em>Partula langfordi;</em> akaleha, denden). Seven plant species—<em>Bulbophyllum guamense</em> (siboyas halumtanu, siboyan halom tano), <em>Dendrobium guamense</em> (no common name (NCN), <em>Cycas micronesica</em> (fadang, faadang), <em>Maesa walkeri</em> (NCN), <em>Nervilia jacksoniae</em> (NCN), <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis</em> (NCN), and <em>Tuberolabium guamense</em> (NCN)—are listed as threatened species.</p>
          <p id="p-10" data-page="59424">Delineation of critical habitat
 requires, within the geographical area occupied by the species, 
identification of the physical or biological features essential to the 
species' conservation. Information regarding the life functions and 
habitats associated with these life functions is complex, and 
informative data are largely lacking for the 23 Mariana Islands species.
 A careful assessment of the areas that may have the physical or 
biological features essential for the conservation of the species and 
that may require special management considerations or protections, and 
thus qualify for designation as critical habitat, will require a 
thorough assessment. We require additional time to analyze the best 
available scientific data in order to identify specific areas 
appropriate for critical habitat designation. Accordingly, we find 
designation of critical habitat to be “not determinable” at this time.</p>
          <p id="p-11" data-page="59424">
            <em>The basis for our action.</em> Under the Endangered 
Species Act, we can determine that a species is an endangered or 
threatened species based on any of five factors: (A) The present or 
threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or 
range; (B) Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or 
educational purposes; (C) Disease or predation; (D) The inadequacy of 
existing regulatory mechanisms; or (E) Other natural or manmade factors 
affecting its continued existence. We have determined that the 23 
Mariana Islands species are experiencing population-level impacts as the
 result of the following current and ongoing threats:</p>
          
            <ul class="bullets">
          <li id="p-12" data-page="59424">Habitat loss and degradation 
due to development, military activities, and urbanization; nonnative 
feral ungulates (hoofed mammals, for example, deer, pigs, and water 
buffalo) and nonnative plants; rats; snakes; wildfire; typhoons; water 
extraction; and the synergistic effects of future climate change.</li>
          <li id="p-13" data-page="59424">Predation or herbivory by nonnative feral ungulates, rats, snakes, monitor lizards, slugs, flatworms, ants, and wasps.</li>

          <p id="p-16" data-page="59424">
            <em>Peer review and public comment.</em> We sought comments 
from independent specialists to ensure that all of our determinations

          <h2 id="h-9">Previous Federal Actions</h2>

          <p id="p-17" data-page="59425">Please refer to the proposed listing rule, published in the <strong>Federal Register</strong> on October 1, 2014 (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/79-FR-59364">79 FR 59364</a>),
 for previous Federal actions for these species prior to that date. The 
publication of the proposed listing rule opened a 60-day comment period,
 beginning on October 1, 2014, and closing on December 1, 2014. In 
addition, we published a public notice of the proposed rule on October 
18, 2014, in the Marianas Variety, Marianas Variety Guam, and the Guam 
Pacific Daily News newspapers. On January 12, 2015 (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/80-FR-1491">80 FR 1491</a>),
 we reopened the comment period for an additional 30 days and announced 
two public hearings, each preceded by public information meetings 
(January 27, 2015, on Guam; and January 28, 2015, on Saipan); and two 
separate public information meetings, one each on Rota (January 29, 
2015) and Tinian (January 31, 2015). This second comment period closed 
on February 11, 2015. We published public notices in the local Marianas 
Variety and Pacific Daily News on January 23, 2015, in order to inform 
the public about the hearings and information meetings, as well as the 
reopening of the comment period. In total, we accepted public comments 
on the October 1, 2014, proposed rule (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/79-FR-59364">79 FR 59364</a>) for 90 days.</p>
          <h2 id="h-10">Summary of Changes From Proposed Rule</h2>
          <p id="p-18" data-page="59425">In preparing this final rule, 
we reviewed and fully considered comments from the peer reviewers and 
public on the proposed listings for 23 species. This final rule 
incorporates the following substantive changes to our proposed rule, 
based on the comments we received:</p>

          <p id="p-19" data-page="59425">(1) The proposed rule described the status of five plant species (four orchids: <em>Bulbophyllum guamense, Dendrobium guamense,</em>
            <em>Nervilia jacksoniae,</em> and <em>Tuberolabium guamense;</em> and a plant in the family Primulaceae, <em>Maesa walkeri</em>)
 as meeting the definition of an endangered species under section 3(6) 
of the Act (any species which is in danger of extinction throughout all 
or a significant portion of its range). However, new information from 
further surveys has shown that these five plant species are more 
numerous on the island of Rota than previous data indicated, each with a
 population structure consisting of seedlings, juveniles, and adults. 
This new information indicates that these five plant species are not 
quite as imperiled throughout their ranges as previously understood at 
the time of the proposed rule. However, these species are still 
susceptible to habitat destruction and modification by nonnative plants 
and animals, fire, and the future effects of climate change on Rota. 
Additionally, at least 50 percent of their respective ranges occur on 
the island of Guam, where these species once occurred in abundance but 
now exist in very low numbers of individuals, and face similar threats 
as on Rota, in addition to habitat destruction and modification by urban
 development, military development and training, brown treesnakes (<em>Boiga irregularis</em>), and feral pigs (<em>Sus scrofa</em>).</p>

          <p id="p-20" data-page="59425">The Act defines an endangered 
species as “any species which is in danger of extinction throughout all 
or a significant portion of its range,” and a threatened species as “any
 species which is likely to become an endangered species within the 
foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its 
range.” Therefore, because the four orchid species (<em>Bulbophyllum guamense, Dendrobium guamense, Nervilia jacksoniae,</em> and <em>Tuberolabium guamense</em>) and <em>Maesa walkeri</em>
 appear relatively healthy on Rota, but face threats throughout all of 
their ranges, and have declined across at least 50 percent of their 
ranges (<em>i.e.,</em> on Guam), we have retained them in this final 
listing determination but have changed their status to threatened 
species, as they are at risk of becoming endangered within the 
foreseeable future throughout all of their ranges. All new data received
 during the comment period for these five species have been added to 
Description of the 23 Mariana Islands Species and Summary of Biological 
Status and Threats Affecting the 23 Mariana Islands Species, below. 
Further, our rationale for listing each of these five species as 
threatened species, versus endangered species, is discussed under 
Determination, below.</p>

          <p id="p-21" data-page="59425">(2) We updated the section titled “Historical and Ongoing Human Impacts” under <em>The Mariana Islands,</em> below, to include recent changes in proposed military actions.</p>

          <p id="p-22" data-page="59425">(3) We have corrected our original description of the political division of Micronesia. See “Political Division” under <em>The Mariana Islands,</em> below.</p>

          <p id="p-23" data-page="59425">(4) We have added new island occurrences for three species addressed in this final rule. <em>Dendrobium guamense</em>
 was recently discovered on the island of Aguiguan—a brand new island 
record (Zarones 2015a, in litt.); the humped tree snail was recently 
observed on Tinian, an island on which the humped tree snail was 
previously thought to be extirpated (Naval Facilities Engineering 
Command Pacific (NavFac, Pacific) 2014, pp. 5-5, 5-7); and one 
individual of <em>Heritiera longipetiolata</em> was reported from Rota, 
an island on which it was thought this species was extirpated (Cook 
2010, pers. comm. cited in CNMI Department of Land and Natural Resources
 (DLNR) 2014, in litt.). These three island additions have been placed 
under <em>Islands in the Mariana Archipelago,</em> Description of the 23 Mariana Islands Species, and Table 1, below.</p>
          <p id="p-24" data-page="59425">(5) We have corrected the 
common names for many of the plant and animal species addressed in this 
final rule after consultation with a Chamorro and Carolinian language 
expert and a comment received from a peer reviewer. These changes can be
 observed in Table 1 and under Description of the 23 Mariana Islands 
Species, below.</p>

          <p id="p-25" data-page="59425">(6) We have added the 
parenthetical “(Mariana subspecies)” to the common name of the Pacific 
sheath-tailed bat addressed in this rule, specifically the subspecies <em>Emballonura semicaudata rotensis,</em>
 to allow the reader to more easily distinguish between the four 
subspecies of Pacific sheath-tailed bats that are known by the same 
common name.</p>
          <p id="p-26" data-page="59425">(7) Due to a comment we 
received from a peer reviewer, we have changed our general description 
of partulid (referring to a genus of tree snails in the Pacific) 
characteristics (see Description of the 23 Mariana Islands Species) to 
include that the mobility of partulids is more related to ambient 
precipitation and humidity, rather than with the time of day. Previous 
reports indicated that partulids are primarily nocturnal.</p>

          <p id="p-27" data-page="59425">(8) Due to comments received 
from a peer reviewer and new information, we have expanded our 
description of the negative impacts associated with the manokwari 
flatworm, also known as the New Guinea flatworm (<em>Platydemus manokwari</em>), on the four tree snails under <em>Flatworm Predation on Tree Snails</em>
 under Summary of Biological Status and Threats Affecting the 23 Mariana
 Islands Species, below. This new information suggests that we had 
greatly underestimated the severity and scope of the threat posed by the
 manokwari flatworm in the proposed rule.</p>

          <p id="p-28" data-page="59425">(9) Due to comments received by
 the U.S. Navy, and in light of the new 2014 Draft Supplemental 
Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) and subsequent 2015 Final EIS, we 
updated the description of the Marine Corps relocation under “Historical
 and Ongoing Human Impacts,” below. We <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59426"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59426" data-page="59426" data-text="Start Printed Page 59426" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59426}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59426</span></span></span>cited
 the Final Supplemental EIS (SEIS) released in July of 2015, and 
associated changes, which include a proposal to construct and operate 
facilities on Guam (not Tinian) to support the training and operations 
of Marines and the removal of the proposal to create four ranges on 
Tinian since the associated training requirements satisfied by those 
four ranges are now the subject of another EIS (Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands Joint Military Training (CJMT) EIS, described 
below). We also dropped “and Tinian” in the description of the revised 
proposed actions associated with the 2015 Final SEIS associated with the
 relocation. Additionally, we removed the construction of a deep-draft 
wharf in Apra Harbor and facilities to support the U.S. Missile Defense 
Task Force since this is no longer proposed on Guam (and is not 
addressed in the revised proposed action covered in the 2014 Draft SEIS 
or 2015 Final SEIS).</p>
          <p id="p-29" data-page="59426">(10) Due to comments received 
by the U.S. Navy, and in light of the new 2015 Final SEIS, we updated 
the description of the Marine Corps relocation under “Historical and 
Ongoing Human Impacts,” below. The updates include the construction of a
 Marine Corps cantonment (main base) at Naval Computer and 
Telecommunications Station Finegayan, family housing on Andersen Air 
Force Base (AAFB), and a live-fire training range on AAFB-Northwest 
Field as the preferred alternatives. We noted that Orote Point, Pati 
Point, and Navy Barrigada are no longer preferred locations for any 
facilities to support the Marine Corps move.</p>

          <p id="p-30" data-page="59426">(11) We have edited the section titled “Ordnance and Live-Fire Training” under <em>Factor E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Their Continued Existence,</em>
 below. We changed the physical location of the ordnance and live-fire 
training, and subsequently the species impacted by this threat, due to 
changes presented in the Navy's 2014 Draft SEIS (Joint Guam Program 
Office (JGPO)-NavFac, Pacific 2014, p. ES-1) and 2015 Final SEIS 
(JGPO-NavFac, Pacific 2015, p. ES-11; <em><a date="10/01/2015" href="http://www.guambuildupeis.us/">http://www.guambuildupeis.us/​</a></em>), and the 2015 CNMI Joint Military Training Draft EIS/Overseas EIS (OEIS) (<em><a date="10/01/2015" href="http://www.cnmijointmilitarytrainingeis.com/about">http://www.cnmijointmilitarytrainingeis.com/​about</a></em>). In this final rule, the species that are considered to be negatively impacted by ordnance and live-fire include the plants <em>Cycas micronesica, Heritiera longipetiolata, Psychotria malaspinae,</em> and <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis</em>
 and the humped tree snail, Mariana eight-spot butterfly, and Slevin's 
skink. This change is also noted under “Historical and Ongoing Human 
Impacts” and Table 3, below.</p>

          <p id="p-31" data-page="59426">(12) We added new information 
to “Conservation Efforts to Reduce Disease and Predation” and 
“Conservation Efforts to Reduce Habitat Destruction, Modification, or 
Curtailment of Its Range,” below. In 2013, the U.S. Navy erected five 
new exclosures on Tinian, each with 1,000 mature individuals of <em>Cycas micronesica.</em> In 2014, the U.S. Navy funded $5.1 M towards brown treesnake projects in the Mariana Islands.</p>

          <p id="p-32" data-page="59426">(13) Due to new data we 
received during the comment period, we added the Mariana eight-spot 
butterfly, Mariana wandering butterfly, and the Pacific sheath-tailed 
bat (Mariana subspecies) to “Small Number of Individuals and 
Populations,” below. A recent genetic analysis found no heterogeneity 
exists between three separate populations of the Mariana eight-spot 
butterfly on Guam (Lindstrom and Benedict 2014, p. 27). In fact, they 
found the genetic sequences studied to be identical, which is indicative
 that little population structure exists among these mobile insects, and
 that they have recently experienced a population bottleneck limiting 
genetic diversity for this species on Guam (Lindstrom and Benedict 2014,
 p. 27). Additionally, since there are no recent observations of the 
Mariana wandering butterfly, we have deduced that if a population 
exists, it does so in very small numbers and, therefore, faces the same 
threat of reduced genetic diversity as the Mariana eight-spot butterfly.
 A recent genetic analysis of the Pacific sheath-tailed bat (Mariana 
subspecies) found no genetic diversity among the only known extant 
population of this species (Oyler-McCance <em>et al.</em> 2013, pp. 
1,034-1,035). This new data, combined with the observed decrease in 
range from five islands formerly (Guam, Rota, Saipan, Tinian, and 
Aguiguan) to just one at present (Aguiguan), has led the Service to 
conclude that the Pacific sheath-tailed bat (Mariana subspecies) is at 
risk from low numbers of individuals and populations. We have added the 
two butterflies and bat addressed in this rule to the threat of small 
number of individuals and populations under Table 3, and <em>Factor E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Their Continued Existence</em>
 “Small Number of Individuals and Populations,” below. Additionally, we 
added the fragile tree snail under the section titled “Small Number of 
Individuals and Populations,” below, as it was noted in Table 3, but 
missing from the discussion under Factor E.</p>
          <p id="p-33" data-page="59426">(14) Due to a comment from a 
peer reviewer, we have made a change regarding the life-cycle of 
Slevin's skink under Description of the 23 Mariana Islands Species, 
below. In the proposed rule, we cited Brown (1991, pp. 14-15) as stating
 that Slevin's skinks are viviparous (lay their eggs internally and give
 birth to live young). We have corrected this statement to reflect more 
recent observations indicating that Slevin's skinks are oviparous (lay 
eggs that mature and hatch externally) (Zug 2013, p. 184; Rodda 2014, in
 litt.).</p>

          <p id="p-34" data-page="59426">(15) Due to new information 
received during the comment period, we have added a new occurrence for 
the Rota blue damselfly. Zarones (<em>et al.</em> 2015b, in litt.) 
reported a new observation of an individual of the Rota blue damselfly, 
located at a stream east of the Water Cave that is not connected to the 
Water Cave (Okgok) Stream. This finding was confirmed by U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service (Service) entomologists. This new occurrence has been 
added under Description of the 23 Mariana Islands Species, below.</p>

          <p id="p-35" data-page="59426">(16) According to new 
information we received during the comment period, we corrected the name
 of I-Chenchon Park, which is now the Mariana Crow Conservation Area; 
added the Sabana Heights and Talakhaya conservation areas under the 
Sabana Wildlife Conservation Area on Rota; and added the newly 
established Nightingale Reed-warbler Conservation Area and the 
Micronesian Megapode Conservation area to conservation areas on Saipan 
(see <em>Islands in the Mariana Archipelago,</em> below).</p>

          <p id="p-36" data-page="59426">(17) After further analysis, we have concluded that feral cattle are not a threat to the plant <em>Heritiera longipetiolata</em>
 on the island of Tinian, nor are feral cattle considered present in 
large enough numbers to be assigned to the island of Tinian in Table 4, 
below. The humped tree snail was believed to be extirpated from Tinian 
at the time of the proposed rule and, therefore, was not previously 
assigned this threat on Tinian. Both feral and domestic cattle have been
 present on Tinian for centuries and have reportedly caused 
broad-ranging negative impacts to the forest ecosystem (<em>i.e.,</em> erosion, trampling, and grazing); however, the number of feral cattle on Tinian has declined in recent times (Wiles <em>et al.</em>
 1990, pp. 167-180; Flores 2015, in litt.). Cattle ranching on Tinian is
 on the rise, and depending on the location and amount of land allotted 
to cattle ranching, negative impacts to the forest ecosystem may be 
observed in the future. However, at the time of this final rule, neither
 feral nor domestic cattle <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59427"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59427" data-page="59427" data-text="Start Printed Page 59427" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59427}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59427</span></span></span>are considered a threat to the plant <em>Heritiera longipetiolata</em> or the humped tree snail on the island of Tinian.</p>

          <p id="p-37" data-page="59427">(18) In the Regulation Promulgation section of the proposed rule, we identified the historic range of <em>Cycas micronesica</em> as Guam and the Mariana Islands. We have corrected the historic range of <em>Cycas micronesica</em>
 in this final rule to additionally include the sovereign island nation 
of the Federated States of Micronesia (the island of Yap), and the 
independent island nation of the Republic of Palau.</p>

described above in the section Summary of Changes from Proposed Rule.</p>
          <h4 id="h-14">Historical and Ongoing Human Impacts</h4>
          <p id="p-40" data-page="59429">After the initial Chamorro 
modifications for agriculture and villages, the flora and fauna on the 
Mariana Islands continued to undergo alterations due not only to ongoing
 volcanic activity in the northern islands, but also to land use 
activities and nonnative species introduced by European colonialists. 
The arrival of the Spanish in 1591 further imposed degradation of the 
ecosystems of the Mariana Islands with the introduction of numerous 
nonnative animals and plants. The Spanish occupied the Mariana Islands 
for nearly 300 years (SIO 2014, in litt.). In 1899, Spain sold the 
Mariana Islands to Germany, with the exception of Guam, which was ceded 
to the United States as a result of the Spanish-American war (SIO 2012, 
in litt.; Encyclopedia Britannica 2014, in litt.).</p>

          <p id="p-41" data-page="59429">The German administration 
altered the forest ecosystem on Rota, Saipan, and Tinian, and on some of
 the northern islands, by means of <em>Cocos nucifera</em> (coconut) 
farming, which was encouraged for the production of copra (the dried 
fleshy part of a coconut used to make coconut oil) (Russell 1998, pp. 
94-95). Upon the start of World War I, the Japanese quickly took over 
German occupied islands and accelerated the alteration of the landscape 
by clearing large areas of native forest on Rota, Saipan, and Tinian, 
for growing <em>Saccharum officinarum</em> (sugarcane) and building associated refineries, and for planting <em>Acacia confusa</em>
 (sosugi) to provide fuel wood (CNMI-SWARS 2010, pp. 6-7). The Japanese 
drastically altered the islands of Saipan and Tinian, and to a lesser 
extent on Rota, leaving little native forest. Military activities during
 World War II further altered the landscape on Saipan and Tinian. Rota 
was a notable exception, left relatively untouched (CNMI-SWARS 2010, p. 
7). Japan also occupied Guam at the onset of World War II; however, by 
1944 the United States neutralized the Mariana Islands with the 
recapture of Saipan, Tinian, and Guam (Encyclopedia Britannica 2014, in 
litt.). Since World War II, the U.S. military has developed a strong 
presence in the Mariana Islands, particularly on the island of Guam, 
where both the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force operate large military 
installations. The island of Farallon de Medinilla is used for military 
ordnance training (Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005, p. 130).</p>

          <p id="p-42" data-page="59429">Currently, the U.S. Department 
of Defense is implementing a project referred to as the “Guam and 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Military Relocation” (Joint
 Guam Program Office (JGPO)-Naval Facilities Engineering command, 
Pacific (JGPO-NavFac, Pacific) 2010a, p. ES-1; JGPO-NavFac, Pacific

 This military relocation proposes: (1) The relocation of a portion of 
the U.S. Marine Corps (Marine Corps) currently in Okinawa, Japan, which 
consists of up to 5,000 Marines and their 1,300 dependents, as revised 
in the Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS)

 cantonment, family housing, and associated infrastructure) on Guam to 
support the relocation of military personnel and their dependents 
(JGPO-NavFac, Pacific 2015, p. ES-3; <em><a date="10/01/2015" href="http://guambuildupeis.us/">http://guambuildupeis.us/​</a></em>);
 and (3) the development and construction of facilities and 
infrastructure on Guam to support training and operations for the 
relocated Marines, specifically a Live-Fire Training Range Complex 
(LFTRC) (JGPO-NavFac, Pacific 2015, p. ES-3; <em><a date="10/01/2015" href="http://guambuildupeis.us/">http://guambuildupeis.us/​</a></em>)</p>

          <p id="p-43" data-page="59429">The Final 2015 SEIS focuses on 
changes to the proposed actions and alternatives identified in the 2010 
Final EIS (JGPO-NavFac, Pacific 2014, p. ES-1) and 2014 Draft SEIS

 The preferred alternative sites on Guam for the implementation of the 
Marine relocation efforts and development of an LFTRC now include

and Alternative 5 Northwest Field on Andersen AFB, respectively. 
Alternative E is a new alternative not presented in the 2014 Draft SEIS.
 The 2014 Draft SEIS had listed Alternative A Finegayan as the preferred
 alternative for cantonment and housing, and the new preferred 
Alternative E places the cantonment on Finegayan and family housing on 
Andersen AFB. This new Alternative E was added to reduce the amount of 
vegetation that would have to be cleared, present additional 
opportunities for forest enhancement mitigation, maintain the natural 
buffer area between developed areas and nearby sensitive coastal 
resources (<em>e.g.,</em> Haputo Ecological Reserve Area), and leverage 
existing family housing support facilities already in place at Andersen 
AFB (JGPO-NavFac, Pacific 2015, p. ES-15; <em><a date="10/01/2015" href="http://guambuildupeis.us/">http://guambuildupeis.us/​</a></em>).
 Finegayan and Northwest Field on Andersen AFB collectively support 16 
of the 23 species or their habitats (11 of the 14 plants: <em>Bulbophyllum
 guamense, Cycas micronesica, Dendrobium guamense, Eugenia bryanii, 
Heritiera longipetiolata, Maesa walkeri, Nervilia jacksoniae, Psychotria
 malaspinae, Solanum guamense, Tabernaemontana rotensis,</em> and <em>Tuberolabium guamense;</em>
 and 5 of the 9 animals: The Mariana eight-spot butterfly, the Mariana 
wandering butterfly, the Guam tree snail, the humped tree snail, and the
 fragile tree snail) (JGPO-NavFac, Pacific 2014, pp. ES-18—ES-22;

          <p id="p-44" data-page="59429">The Final SEIS describes: (1) 
More moderate construction activity over 13 years instead of a 7-year 
intense construction boom; (2) a significant reduction in projected peak
 population increase (from 79,000 to less than 10,000) and steady state 
population increase (from 33,000 to approximately 7,400); (3) a 
reduction in the project area at Finegayan from 2,580 ac (1,044 ha) to 
1,213 ac (491 ha); (4) utilization of 510 ac (206 ha) of existing 
infrastructure on Andersen AFB for family housing; (5) no new land

          <p id="p-45" data-page="59429">Concurrent with the relocation 
efforts discussed above, the U.S. Marine Corps (the Executive Agent 
designated by the U.S. Pacific Command) published their “Commonwealth of
 the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) Joint Military Training (CJMT) 
Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)-Overseas Environmental Impact
 Statement (OEIS)” (herein referred to as the “CJMT Draft EIS-OEIS”) 
(CNMI Joint Military Training Draft EIS-OEIS at <em><a date="10/01/2015" href="http://www.cnmijointmilitarytrainingeis.com/about">http://www.cnmijointmilitarytrainingeis.com/​about</a></em>).
 The 2015 Draft CJMT EIS-OEIS informs the public that the military has 
proposed plans to use Tinian and Pagan to establish a series of 
live-fire range training areas, training courses, and maneuver areas to 
reduce existing joint service training deficiencies and meet the U.S. 
Pacific Command Service Components' unfilled unit level and combined 
level training requirements in the Pacific (2015 CNMI Joint Military 
Training Draft EIS-OEIS at <em><a date="10/01/2015" href="http://www.cnmijointmilitarytrainingeis.com/about">http://www.cnmijointmilitarytrainingeis.com/​about</a></em>).<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59430"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59430" data-page="59430" data-text="Start Printed Page 59430" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59430}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59430</span></span></span>
          </p>

          <p id="p-46" data-page="59430">The northern two-thirds of 
Tinian are leased to the Department of Defense (DOD), and the 
development of these lands will negatively impact the habitat of 2 of 
the 23 species addressed in this final rule, the plant <em>Heritiera longipetiolata,</em> and the humped tree snail. Likewise, live-fire training on Tinian will negatively impact the habitat and individuals of <em>H. longipetiolata</em>
 and the humped tree snail. On Pagan, both Alternative 1 and Alternative
 2 claim the entire island for training purposes, with the north 
dedicated to live-fire maneuver areas, and the south dedicated to 
non-live-fire maneuver areas (CJMT Draft EIS-OEIS <em><a date="10/01/2015" href="http://www.cnmijointmilitarytrainingeis.com/about">http://www.cnmijointmilitarytrainingeis.com/​about</a></em>).
 If the entire island of Pagan is used for training purposes, it will 
negatively impact 2 of the 16 species listed as endangered species in 
this final rule, Slevin's skink and the humped tree snail, and their 
habitats. Additionally, <em>Cycas micronesica</em> may be present on Pagan, although this is not yet confirmed. If <em>Cycas micronesica</em>
 is confirmed on Pagan, then this species would be considered negatively
 impacted by ordnance and live-fire training on both Guam and Pagan.</p>

          <p id="p-47" data-page="59430">Additionally the entire Mariana
 archipelago is located within the Mariana Islands Training and Testing 
(MITT) Study Area, which comprises air, land, and sea space, and 
includes the existing Mariana Islands Range Complex (MIRC), its 
surrounding seas, and a transit corridor between the MIRC and the Navy's
 Hawaii Range Complex, where training and testing activities may occur. 
The MIRC is the only Navy range complex in the MITT Study Area 
(JGPO-NavFac, Pacific 2013, pp. 1-3; Mariana Islands Training and 
Testing <em><a date="10/01/2015" href="http://mitt-eis.com/EISOEIS/Background.aspx">http://mitt-eis.com/​EISOEIS/​Background.aspx</a></em>). The MITT Study Area opens up every island within the Mariana Archipelago as a potential training site (<em>Mariana Islands Training and Testing</em>
            <em><a date="10/01/2015" href="http://mitt-eis.com/EISOEIS/Background.aspx">http://mitt-eis.com/​EISOEIS/​Background.aspx</a></em>),
 which subsequently may result in negative impacts to any number of the 
23 species addressed in this final rule. Proposed actions include 
increases in training activities on Guam, Rota, Saipan, Tinian, Farallon
 de Medinilla (increase in bombing), and Pagan. Likely negative impacts 
include, but are not limited to, direct damage to individuals from 
live-fire training and ordnance, wildfire resulting from live-fire and 
ordnance, direct physical damage (<em>e.g.,</em> trampling by humans, 
helicopter landing, etc.) to individuals, and spread of nonnative 
species. Additionally, water purification training is proposed for all 
of these islands, except Farallon de Medinilla, which may be 
particularly damaging to the Rota blue damselfly, for which the only 
known location exists along the freshwater streams of the Talakhaya 
watershed.</p>

          <p id="p-48" data-page="59430">In addition to military 
spending, Guam's economy depends on tourism. More than one million 
tourists visit Guam annually, mostly arriving from Japan, Korea, and 
other Asian countries. In the early 1960s, military contributions to 
Guam's economy approached 60 percent, with tourism adding almost another
 30 percent. There was a downturn in military presence in the 70s and 
80s. Also at this time, the growth of a private economy occurred, fueled
 by tourism (Guampedia <em><a date="10/01/2015" href="http://www.guampedia.com/evolution-of-the-tourism-industry-on-guam-2/">http://www.guampedia.com/​evolution-of-the-tourism-industry-on-guam-2/​</a></em>,
 Accessed April 23, 2015). Currently, tourism accounts for about 60 
percent of Guam's annual business revenue and 30 percent of all 
non-Federal jobs (Guam Visitor Bureau 2014, p. 3; <em><a date="10/01/2015" href="http://www.guamvisitorsbureau.com/">http://www.guamvisitorsbureau.com/​</a></em>, accessed April 25, 2014; <em><a date="10/01/2015" href="http://guampedia.com/evolution-of-the-tourism-industry-on-guam-2/#toc-consequences-and-conclusions">http://guampedia.com/​evolution-of-the-tourism-industry-on-guam-2/​#toc-consequences-and-conclusions</a></em>, accessed April 25, 2014).</p>

          <p id="p-49" data-page="59430">An increase in human 
population, whether from tourism or a military presence, also increases 
the type and intensity of stressors on endangered and threatened 
species. These stressors range from increased development, which results
 in loss of habitat, to increased risk for introduction of harmful 
nonnative species, which directly or indirectly impact native species 
and their habitats. As Guam is seeking a “no visa required” status for 
visitors from Russia and China (Guam Visitor Bureau 2014, p. 33), 
monitoring of sea ports and airports against inadvertent introduction of
 harmful and invasive species is especially important (see “<em>Factor D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms”</em>).
 The proposed increase in military training activities throughout the 
Marianas heightens the importance for enhanced monitoring at these 
sites.</p>
          <h4 id="h-15">Political Division</h4>

          <p id="p-50" data-page="59430">Micronesia is made up of six 
island groups: (1) Mariana Islands; (2) Caroline Islands, consisting of 
the sovereign island nation of the Federated States of Micronesia (Yap, 
Chuuk, Pohnpei, and Kosrae) and the independent island nation of the 
Republic of Palau; (3) Gilbert Islands (politically the Republic of 
Kiribati); (4) Marshall Islands (politically the Republic of the 
Marshall Islands); (5) Nauru (politically the Republic of Nauru, the 
world's smallest republic, consisting of a single phosphate rock 
island); and (6) Wake Island (also known as Wake Atoll, an unorganized, 
unincorporated territory of the United States). Micronesia, together 
with Polynesia, is described as the “Polynesia-Micronesia Hotspot,” 
reflecting the fact that these island groups contain an exceptional 
concentration of endemic (found nowhere else in the world) species, and 
are currently experiencing exceptional habitat loss (Myers <em>et al.</em> 2000, pp. 853-858) (see Summary of Biological Status and Threats Affecting the 23 Mariana Islands Species, below).</p>

These sections reflect new information received during the two comment 
periods on the proposed rule.</p>
          <h4 id="h-17">Guam</h4>

          <p id="p-52" data-page="59430">Guam is the largest and 
southernmost island of the Mariana Islands. It is nearly 31 miles (mi) 
(50 kilometers (km)) long and from 4 to 9 mi (7 to 15 km) wide, with a 
peak elevation of 1,332 feet (ft) (406 meters (m)) at Mt. Lamlam 
(Muller-Dombois and Fosberg 1998, p. 269). Guam is located in the 
northwestern Pacific Ocean, 1,200 mi (1,930 km) east of the Philippines,
 3,500 mi (5,632 km) west of the Hawaiian Islands, and 54 mi (87 km) 
south of Rota. The northern and southern regions of the island show 
marked contrast due to their geologic history. The northern region is an
 extensive, upraised, terraced, limestone plateau or “mesa” between 300 
and 600 ft (90 and 180 m) above sea level interrupted by a few low 
hills, of which two (Mataguac and Mt. Santa Rosa) are volcanic in 
nature, while others are exclusively coralline limestone (<em>e.g.,</em> Barrigada Hill and Ritidian Point (Stone 1970, p. 12)). The southern region is primarily volcanic material (<em>e.g.,</em> basalts) with several areas capped by a layer of limestone (Stone 1970, p. 12).</p>

          <p id="p-53" data-page="59430">Of all the Mariana Islands, 
Guam contains the most extensive stream and drainage systems, 
particularly in the Talofofo Region (Stone 1970, p. 13; Muller-Dombois 
and Fosberg 1998, p. 269). Fairly extensive wetland areas are located on
 both coasts of the southern region as well as at Agana Swamp <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59431"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59431" data-page="59431" data-text="Start Printed Page 59431" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59431}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59431</span></span></span>located
 in the middle of the island. Guam is also the most populated of all the
 Mariana Islands, with an estimated 170,000 residents. Guam has 
experienced impacts from at least 4,000 years of human contact, starting
 with the Chamorro, followed by the Spanish, Germans, Japanese, and 
Americans (see “Pre-Historical Human Impact” and “Historical Human 
Impact,” above). World War II and subsequent U.S. military activity have
 also negatively impacted natural habitats on Guam; however, the buffer 
zones around the U.S. Navy and Air Force bases on Guam and conservation 
areas designated on these bases support some of the last remaining 
intact native habitats and subsequently some of the last remaining 
individuals of the rarest species. There are three conservation areas on
 the island designated by the Guam Department of Aquatic and Wildlife 
Resources (GDAWR): (1) Anao Conservation Area; (2) Bolanos Conservation 
Area; and, (3) Cotal Conservation Area (GDAWR 2006, p. 39; Sablan 
Environmental, Inc. 2008, p. 3). Guam supports the forest, savanna, 
stream, and cave ecosystems (see “Mariana Islands Ecosystems,” below). 
Twenty of the 23 species addressed in this final rule occur on Guam (all
 14 plants: <em>Bulbophyllum guamense, Cycas micronesica, Dendrobium 
guamense, Eugenia bryanii, Hedyotis megalantha, Heritiera 
longipetiolata, Maesa walkeri, Nervilia jacksoniae, Phyllanthus 
saffordii, Psychotria malaspinae, Solanum guamense, Tabernaemontana 
rotensis, Tinospora homosepala,</em> and <em>Tuberolabium guamense;</em>
 and 5 of the 9 animals: Slevin's skink (Cocos Island, off Guam), the 
Mariana eight-spot butterfly, the Guam tree snail, the humped tree 
snail, and the fragile tree snail. The Pacific sheath-tailed bat 
(Mariana subspecies) and the Mariana wandering butterfly occurred on 
Guam historically.</p>
          <h4 id="h-18">Rota</h4>

          <p id="p-54" data-page="59431">Just northeast of Guam (36 mi; 
58 km) and southwest of Aguiguan (47 mi; 76 km), Rota is the fourth 
largest island in the Mariana Islands, measuring 33 square miles (mi<sup>2</sup>) (96 square kilometers (km<sup>2</sup>))
 in land area (Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg 1998, p. 265; CNMI Statewide 
Assessment and Resource Strategy Council (CNMI-SWARS) 2010, p. 6). The 
highest point on the island is Mount Sabana (also referred to as the 
Sabana plateau or simply the Sabana), at just over 1,600 ft (488 m) 
(Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg 1998, p. 265). The Sabana plateau is 
characterized by a savanna ringed by forest that extends onto the 
surrounding karst limestone cliffs and down the rugged slopes that 
encircle all sides of the Sabana (Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg 1998, pp. 
265-266). Rota consists primarily of terraced limestone surrounding a 
volcanic core that protrudes from the topmost plateau, or Sabana. The 
Sabana is noticeably wetter than the rest of the island and is the only 
location known to support all four orchids listed as threatened species 
in this final rule (<em>Bulbophyllum guamense, Dendrobium guamense, Nervilia jacksoniae,</em> and <em>Tuberolabium guamense</em>) (Harrington <em>et al.</em> 2012, in litt.).</p>

          <p id="p-55" data-page="59431">Rota has experienced land 
alterations since the arrival of the first Chamorro more than 4,000 
years ago. When the Mariana Islands were occupied by the Japanese 
(1914-1944), they cleared forest areas to plant large sugarcane 
plantations and conducted phosphate mining on the Sabana plateau (Amidon
 2000, pp. 4-5; Engbring <em>et al.</em> 1986, pp. 10, 27). Although 
Rota was never invaded during World War II, it was heavily bombed by 
U.S. military forces (Engbring <em>et al.</em> 1986, pp. 8, 11). Rota 
has a population of approximately 3,000 people. In recent years, three 
terrestrial conservation areas have been designated on Rota by the CNMI 
Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR): (1) The Sabana Wildlife
 Conservation Area (which includes the Sabana Heights Conservation Area 
and the Talakhaya Conservation Area); (2) Mariana Crow Conservation Area
 and Bird Sanctuary; and (3) Wedding Cake Wildlife Conservation Area 
(Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005, p. 14). Rota supports the forest, savanna,
 stream, and cave ecosystems. Eleven of the 23 species addressed in this
 final rule currently occur on Rota (8 of the 14 plants: <em>Bulbophyllum guamense, Cycas micronesica, Dendrobium guamense, Heritiera longipetiolata</em> (recently rediscovered; formerly thought extirpated from Rota), <em>Maesa walkeri, Nervilia jacksoniae, Tabernaemontana rotensis,</em> and <em>Tuberolabium guamense;</em>
 and 4 of the 9 animals: The Mariana wandering butterfly, the Rota blue 
damselfly, the fragile tree snail, and the humped tree snail). The plant
 <em>Solanum guamense,</em> and the Pacific sheath-tailed bat (Mariana subspecies), were known from Rota historically.</p>
          <h4 id="h-19">Aguiguan</h4>

          <p id="p-56" data-page="59431">Aguiguan is known as “Goat Island” due to the presence of a large feral goat population (Engbring <em>et al.</em> 1986, p. 8). Located approximately 8 km (5 mi) southwest of Tinian, Aguiguan is a small uninhabited island measuring 7 mi<sup>2</sup> (18 km<sup>2</sup>)
 in land area with a peak elevation of 515 ft (157 m) at Mt. Alutom 
(CNMI-SWARS 2010, p. 6). This island was historically inhabited by the 
Chamorro people (Russell 1998, pp. 90-91). Aguiguan is entirely 
limestone, with very steep cliffs fringing nearly the entire island, 
making access difficult (Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005, p. 36). There are no streams on the island (Engbring <em>et al.</em>
 1986, p. 8). During the Japanese occupation, large areas of native 
forest were cleared for sugarcane plantations, a large runway and other 
war-related structures (Engbring <em>et al.</em> 1986, p. 8; 
Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg 1998, p. 264). Ecosystem types on Aguiguan 
include forest and cave. Four of the 23 species addressed in this final 
rule occur on Aguiguan: the plant <em>Dendrobium guamense</em> (recently
 discovered for the first time on Aguiguan); and the Pacific 
sheath-tailed bat (Mariana subspecies), humped tree snail, and 
Langford's tree snail. The plant <em>Tuberolabium guamense</em> was known from Aguiguan historically.</p>
          <h4 id="h-20">Tinian</h4>

          <p id="p-57" data-page="59431">Located approximately 3 mi (5 
km) southeast of Saipan and 7 mi (9 km) north of Aguiguan, Tinian is the
 third largest island in the Mariana Islands, measuring 40 mi<sup>2</sup> (101 km<sup>2</sup>) in area, with a peak elevation of 584 ft (178 m) at Lasso Hill (Engbring <em>et al.</em> 1986, p. 5). The island of Tinian has a population of over 3,000 residents. Tinian's climate is the same as that of Guam (see “<em>The Mariana Islands,”</em> above). The island is predominantly limestone with low-lying plateaus and ridges, and lacks surface streams (Stafford <em>et al.</em> 2005, p. 15; Engbring <em>et al.</em>
 1986, p. 5). There are two small wetland areas, heavily overgrown with 
no open water, Hagoi Marsh and Marpo Swamp, which serve as a domestic 
water source (Engbring <em>et al.</em> 1986, p. 5). Tinian has lost most
 of its primary (native) forest, due initially to clearing for 
agriculture by the Chamorro, followed by agricultural endeavors of 
German colonialists in the early 1900s (<em>e.g.,</em> coconut plantations) and then by Japanese settlers after 1914 (<em>e.g.,</em> sugarcane plantations) (Berger <em>et al.</em>
 2005, pp. 36-37). Impacts to Tinian's native vegetation were then 
compounded by impacts from military activities during World War II 
(Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg 1998, p. 262; Russell 1998, p. 98; 
CNMI-SWARS 2010, pp. 6-7, 28-29). Currently, approximately 5 percent of 
primary (native) forest remains on Tinian (Engbring <em>et al.</em> 
1986, p. 25), predominantly along the southeastern portion of Tinian 
(Spaulding 2013, in litt.; Spaulding 2015, in litt.). Tinian supports 
the forest and cave ecosystems. Tinian currently has no designated 
conservation areas.

          <h4 id="h-21">Saipan</h4>

          <p id="p-58" data-page="59432">Located approximately 3 mi (4.5
 km) northeast of Tinian, Saipan is the second largest and second most 
populous of the Mariana Islands, measuring 44 mi<sup>2</sup> (115 km<sup>2</sup>)
 with a peak elevation of 1,555 ft (474 m) at Mt. Tapochau 
(Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg 1998, p. 256). The island is composed 
primarily of terraced limestone peaks, with exposed volcanic ridges and 
slopes (Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg 1998, p. 256). Saipan supported a 
large population of Chamorro people for thousands of years, followed by 
the Spanish, Germans, Japanese, and the U.S. military forces, and was 
also heavily impacted by World War II. Saipan is the site of one of the 
largest battles in the Pacific between U.S. and Japanese forces. Much of
 Saipan's forests were destroyed during World War II, with only pockets 
of native forest surviving (Engbring <em>et al.</em> 1986, pp. 3-5, 10-12; Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005, pp. 38-39). Due to this widespread destruction of native forests and subsequent erosion, the nonnative tree <em>Leucaena leucocephala</em> (tangantangan) was seeded for erosion control (Berger <em>et al.</em>
 2005, p. 32). Tangantangan is now a dominant tree species on the 
island, and the CNMI Division of Forestry has suggested it forms a 
unique mixed forest habitat on Saipan not reported from the other 
islands (CNMI-SWARS 2010, p. 7). There are six conservation areas on 
Saipan: (1) Bird Island Wildlife Conservation Area; (2) Kagman Wildlife 
Conservation Area and Forbidden Island Sanctuary; (3) Marpi Commonwealth
 Forest; (4) Nightingale Reed-Warbler Conservation Area; (5) Micronesian
 Megapode Conservation Area; and (6) the Saipan Upland Mitigation Bank 
(Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005, p. 14). Ecosystem types on Saipan include 
forest, savanna, and cave. One of the 23 species addressed in this final
 rule occurs on Saipan, the humped tree snail. The plants <em>Bulbophyllum guamense, Dendrobium guamense,</em> and <em>Solanum guamense,</em> the Pacific sheath-tailed bat (Mariana subspecies), and the Mariana eight-spot butterfly were known from Saipan historically.</p>
          <h4 id="h-22">Pagan</h4>

          <p id="p-59" data-page="59432">Located 42 mi (68 km) from 
Agrihan and 30 mi (48 km) from Alamagan, Pagan is the fifth largest 
island in the Marianas archipelago, and the largest of the northern 
Mariana Islands, with an area of 19 mi<sup>2</sup> (48 km<sup>2</sup>) 
(Ohba 1994, p. 17). Four volcanoes comprise Pagan: Mt. Pagan in the 
north, and an unnamed complex of three older volcanoes to the south 
(Ohba 1994, p. 17; Smithsonian Institution 2014a, in litt.). These 
volcanoes are connected by a narrow isthmus. The highest point on this 
island is Mt. Pagan, which rises 1,870 ft (570 m) above sea level. Mt. 
Pagan is one of the most active volcanoes in the Mariana Islands, with 
its most recent eruption in 2012 (Smithsonian Institution 2014b, in 
litt.). The largest eruption during historical times took place in 1981,
 when lava buried 10 percent of the island, and ash covered the entire 
island, forcing the 53 residents to flee to Saipan (Smithsonian 
Institution 2014b, in litt.). The island of Pagan supports the forest 
and savanna ecosystems. Two of the 23 species are known to occur on 
Pagan, the animals Slevin's skink and the humped tree snail. The tree <em>Cycas micronesica</em> also likely occurs on Pagan; however, this is not yet confirmed (see <em>Cycas micronesica</em> under Description of the 23 Mariana Islands Species, below). The plant <em>Bulbophyllum guamense</em> occurred historically on Pagan.</p>

          <h2 id="h-23">An Ecosystem-Based Approach to Organizing This Listing Rule</h2>
          <p id="p-61" data-page="59432">In the Mariana Islands, as 
within most archipelagos, native species that occur in the same habitat 
types (ecosystems) depend on many of the same biological features and 
the successful functioning of that ecosystem to survive. We have, 
therefore, organized the species addressed in this final rule by common 
ecosystems. Although the listing determination for each species is 
analyzed separately, we have organized the individual analysis for each 
species within the context of the broader ecosystem in which it occurs 
for efficiency and to reduce repetition for the reader. In addition, 
native species that share ecosystems often face a suite of common 
factors that may be a threat to them, and ameliorating or eliminating 
these threats for each individual species often requires the same 
management actions in the same areas. Cost-effective management of these
 threats often requires implementation of conservation actions at the 
ecosystem level to enhance or restore critical ecological processes and 
provide long-term viability of species and their habitat. Organizing the
 23 Mariana Islands species by shared ecosystems may also set the stage 
for a conservation management approach of protecting, restoring, and 
enhancing critical ecological processes at an ecosystem scale for the 
long-term viability of all associated native species in a given 
ecosystem type and locality, thus potentially preventing the future 
imperilment of any additional species that may require protection.</p>

          <p id="p-62" data-page="59432">Based on the best available 
scientific and commercial data, including information received during 
the comment period on our proposed rule (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/79-FR-59364">79 FR 59364</a>; October 1, 2014), we are listing the plants <em>Eugenia bryanii, Hedyotis megalantha, Heritiera longipetiolata, Phyllanthus saffordii, Psychotria malaspinae, Solanum guamense,</em> and <em>Tinospora homosepala;</em>
 and the animals Pacific sheath-tailed bat (Mariana subspecies), 
Slevin's skink, Mariana eight-spot butterfly, Mariana wandering

          <p id="p-64" data-page="59433">For each species, we identified
 and evaluated those factors that are threats to each individual species
 specifically (species-specific threats), as well as those factors which
 pose common threats to all of the species of a given ecosystem type 
(ecosystem-level threats). For example, the degradation of habitat by 
nonnative ungulates is considered a direct or indirect threat to 17 of 
the 23 species listed as endangered or threatened in this final rule. We
 have labeled such threats that are shared by all species within the 
same ecosystem as “ecosystem-level threats,” because they impact all 
species inhabiting that ecosystem type in terms of the nature of the 
impact, its severity, timing, and scope. Beyond ecosystem-level threats,
 we further identified and evaluated species-specific threats that may 
be unique to certain species, and not shared by all other species in the
 same ecosystem. For example, the threat of predation by nonnative 
flatworms is unique and specific to the four tree snails addressed in 
this final rule.</p>

            <em>Mariana Islands Ecosystems</em>
          </h3>

          <p id="p-65" data-page="59433">As noted above, for the 
purposes of organizing our threats discussion for the 23 species by 
shared habitats, we have identified four broad Mariana Islands 
ecosystems: forest, savanna, stream, and cave, based on physical 
features, elevation, substratum, vegetation type, and hydrology (see <em>The Mariana Islands,</em> above; and the proposed rule (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/79-FR-59364">79 FR 59364</a>; October 1, 2014)). We acknowledge the presence of other ecosystems (<em>e.g.,</em>
 coastal, wetland) in the Mariana Islands, however, we limit our 
discussion to these four because they are the relevant ecosystems that 
support the 23 species listed as endangered or threatened species in 
this final rule. These four ecosystems are described in the proposed 
rule (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/79-FR-59364">79 FR 59364</a>;
 October 1, 2014) and these descriptions are hereby incorporated into 
this final rule, with the exception of a revised description of the 
forest ecosystem, below; see Table 2 (above) for a list of the species 
that occur in each ecosystem type.</p>
          <h4 id="h-25">Forest Ecosystem</h4>

          <p id="p-66" data-page="59433">There are two substrate types in the forest ecosystem, limestone and volcanic (Stone 1970, pp. 9, 14, 18-24; Falanruw <em>et al.</em>
 1989, pp. 6-9; Ohba 1994, pp. 19-29; Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg 1998, 
p. 243). The annual rainfall in the forest ecosystem lies within the 
archipelago average, ranging from 78 to 100 inches (in) (2,000 to 2,500 
millimeters (mm)), with a rainy season from June or July through October
 or November. The temperature of the forest ecosystem mirrors the 
archipelago monthly averages, between 75 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) and 82 
°F (24 degrees Celsius (°C) and 28 °C), with extremes of 64 °F and 95 °F
 (18 °C and 35 °C). There are multiple plant species present throughout 
the forest ecosystem, and on most of the islands; however, variations in
 species structure are observed (Fosberg 1960, pp. 37, 56-59, plates 
1-40; Falanruw <em>et al.</em> 1989, pp. 6-9; Ohba 1994, pp. 19-29; Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg 1998, pp. 257, 268, 270-271).</p>

          <p id="p-67" data-page="59433">Native canopy species in the forest ecosystem (as defined here) include but are not limited to: <em>Artocarpus mariannensis, Barringtonia asiatica,</em>

            <em>Phyllanthus marianus,</em> and <em>Piper guamense</em> (Falanruw <em>et al.</em>
 1989, pp. 6-9; Ohba 1994, pp. 19-29; Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg 1998, 
pp. 247, 268). Further, in select areas of the forest ecosystem, usually
 where the forest is situated such that it receives and retains more 
moisture, the canopy trees are covered in various mosses and epiphytic 
ferns and orchids (Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg 1998, p. 268).</p>

          <p id="p-68" data-page="59433">Dominant canopy, subcanopy, and
 understory species can vary from one location to the next on the same 
island, and from island to island. These species can be endemic to one 
island, occur on one or more of the southern islands, or occur on one or
 more of the northern islands. In addition, biologists have <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59434"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59434" data-page="59434" data-text="Start Printed Page 59434" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59434}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59434</span></span></span>observed
 overlap of forest species on limestone and volcanic substrata, 
suggesting that physical properties may be more important than chemical 
properties of these substrates in determining vegetation characteristics
 (Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg 1998, p. 243). Elevation also contributes 
to variations in vegetation, as observed on Mt. Alutom, Mt. Almagosa, 
Mt. Lamlam, and Mt. Bolanus on Guam; the Rota Sabana; and on the slopes 
of the northern islands (Stone 1970, pp. 9, 14, 18-24; Falanruw 1989, 
pp. 4-6; Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg 1998, pp. 262-264); although in 
some cases there is no definite correlation with elevation (<em>i.e.,</em>
 the moisture-retaining, moss- and epiphyte-covered sections of the 
forest ecosystem are found near the coast in some areas and also at mid 
to high elevations) (Fosberg 1960, p. 30). Additionally, biologists have
 observed a change in distribution of <em>Hernandia</em> species with elevation. For example, <em>H. sonora,</em> dominant on the coastal side of the forest ecosystem, changes distinctly to <em>H. labyrinthica</em> as the elevation increases (Falanruw <em>et al.</em>
 1989, p. 8; Amidon 2000, p. 49). The significance of these 
interpretations of forest-associated species in the Mariana archipelago 
to the 14 plants in this rule is not adequately definitive to 
subclassify a forest type for each of the species in this rule; 
therefore, we describe a general forest ecosystem here, with the 
substrate, temperatures, precipitation, and associated native canopy, 
subcanopy, and understory species, listed above. The forest ecosystem 
supports 20 of the 23 species listed as endangered or threatened species
 in this final rule (all except the plants <em>Hedyotis megalantha</em> and <em>Phyllanthus saffordii,</em> which occur only in the savanna ecosystem, and the Rota blue damselfly, which occurs only in the stream ecosystem).</p>

          <h3 id="h-27">Plants</h3>

          <p id="p-69" data-page="59434">In order to avoid confusion regarding the number of populations of each species (<em>i.e.,</em>
 because we do not consider an individual plant to represent a viable 
population), we use the word “occurrence” instead of “population.” 
Additionally, we use the word occurrence to refer only to wild (<em>i.e.,</em>
 not propagated and outplanted) individuals because of the uncertainty 
of the persistence to at least the second generation (F2) of the 
outplanted individuals. A population consists of mature, reproducing 
individuals forming populations that are self-sustaining (as indicated, 
for example, by the presence of individuals representing multiple 
life-history stages). Also, there is a high potential that one or more 
of the outplanted populations may be eliminated by normal or random 
adverse events, such as fire, nonnative plant invasion, or disease, 
before a seed bank can be established.</p>
          <p id="p-70" data-page="59434">
            <em>Bulbophyllum guamense</em> (siboyas halumtanu, siboyan 
halom tano), an epiphyte in the orchid family (Orchidaceae), is known 
from widely distributed occurrences on the southern Mariana Islands of 
Guam and Rota, in the forest ecosystem (Ames 1914, p. 13; Raulerson and 
Rinehart 1992, p. 90; Costion and Lorence 2012, pp. 54, 66; Global 
Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) 2012a—<em>Online Herbarium Database;</em> Zarones <em>et al.</em> 2015c, in litt.). <em>Bulbophyllum guamense</em>
 was recorded historically on Guam from clifflines encircling the 
island, and on the slopes of Mt. Lamlam and Mt. Almagosa. As recently as
 1992, this species was reported to occur in large mat-like formations 
on trees “all over the island,” (Guam) (Raulerson and Rinehart 1992, p. 
90). Currently, there are 12 known occurrences (3 on Guam and 9 on Rota)
 totaling fewer than 250 individuals on Guam and at least 261 
individuals on Rota. At the time of the proposed rule, our information 
indicated that there were likely fewer than 30 individuals of this 
species on Rota. However, a recent survey team on Rota reported at least
 261 individuals of <em>B. guamense</em> along the Sabana tableland and 
slopes above 980 ft (300 m) elevation with a population structure 
consisting of seedlings, juveniles, and flowering adults. This survey 
team estimated the overall number of individuals could be as high as 
16,000. This latter estimate appears to be an assumption based on the 
premise that <em>B. guamense</em> is uniformly distributed across the region in preferred habitat areas (Zarones <em>et al.</em> 2015c, in litt.).</p>

          <p id="p-71" data-page="59434">The Service does not concur 
that there are enough data to determine that this species is uniformly 
distributed across the Sabana, and subsequently cannot support the 
extrapolation of numbers for this species to be as high as 16,000, 
although it is possible. The healthy population structure of <em>B. guamense</em>
 recently observed on Rota, with multiple generations of plants present,
 does show that the status of this species is better on this island than
 previously understood. Historically, there are a couple of herbarium 
records of <em>B. guamense</em> occurring on Pagan (last observed in 
1984) and Saipan (last observed in 1970), however, these are considered 
outliers and not within the accepted endemic range of <em>B. guamense.</em>
 Due to the common occurrence of errors detected throughout the herbaria
 records and literature, the Service recognizes Guam and Rota as the 
most scientifically credible range for this species. <em>Bulbophyllum guamense</em>
 has declined in number of populations and individuals on Guam, which 
represents half of its known range, and the species exists in a 
specialized niche habitat within the forest ecosystem on Rota. The 
remaining individuals of <em>B. guamense</em> are vulnerable to the 
effects of continued habitat loss and destruction from agriculture, 
urban development, nonnative animals and plants, fires, and typhoons, 
combined with predation by nonnative invertebrates such as slugs. We 
anticipate the effects of climate change will further exacerbate many of
 these threats in the future.</p>

            <em>Cycas micronesica</em> (fadang, faadang), a cycad in the
 cycad family (Cycadaceae), is known from Guam, Rota, and tentatively on
 Pagan, as well as Palau (politically the independent Republic of Palau)
 and Yap (geographically part of the Caroline Islands; politically part 
of the Federated States of Micronesia), in the forest ecosystem (Hill <em>et al.</em> 2004, p. 280; Keppel <em>et al.</em> 2008, p. 1,006; Cibrian-Jaramillo <em>et al.</em> 2010, pp. 2,372-2,375; Marler 2013, in litt.).</p>
          <p id="p-73" data-page="59434">Just 10 years ago, <em>Cycas micronesica</em> was ubiquitous on the island of Guam, and similarly common on Rota. <em>Cycas micronesica</em> is currently under attack by a nonnative insect, the cycad aulacaspis scale (<em>Aulacaspis yasumatsui</em>) that is causing rapid mortality of plants at all locations (Marler 2014, in litt.). As of January 2013, <em>C. micronesica</em>
 mortality reached 92 percent on Guam, and cycads on Rota are 
experiencing a similar fate (Marler 2013, in litt.). All seedlings of <em>C. micronesica</em> in a study area were observed to die within 9 months of infestation by <em>A. yasumatsui</em> (see “<em>Factor C. Disease and Predation,”</em>
 below for further discussion) (Marler and Muniappan 2006, p. 3; Marler

on Pagan; however, this is not yet confirmed. On Guam and Rota there are
 fewer than 630,000 (Marler 2013, pers. comm.). These totals do not 
distinguish between successfully reproducing adults and juveniles

 because of the effects of the cycad aulacaspis scale, implies that the 
number of extant individuals that can successfully reproduce is much 
lower. On Guam, there are four fragmented occurrences, totaling fewer 
than 516,000 individuals: One occurrence along the shoreline to the base
 of the limestone cliffs on the north side; a second occurrence 
beginning at the forest edge along the cliffs and continuing into the 
forest on the north side; a third occurrence on the northern plateau; 
and a fourth occurrence along the ravines and rock outcrops on the 
southern side, with a few individuals occurring across the savanna.</p>
          <p id="p-75" data-page="59435">On Rota, there are four known 
occurrences within the forest ecosystem, totaling fewer than 111,500 
individuals (Marler 2013, in litt.). On the northeast shore the first 
occurrence totals fewer than 25,500 individuals; the second occurrence, 
on the northwest shore, totals fewer than 21,600 individuals; the third 
occurrence on the south shore totals fewer than 63,600 individuals; and 
the fourth occurrence on Wedding Cake peninsula totals fewer than 300 
individuals.</p>

          <p id="p-76" data-page="59435">There are likely a relatively limited number of individuals of <em>Cycas micronesica</em> on Pagan. In recent surveys, Pratt (2011, pp. 33-42) reported finding <em>Cycas circinalis</em> in a ravine on the southwest part of the island. Cycas <em>micronesica</em> was once merged with <em>C. rumphii</em> or <em>C. circinalis,</em> but is now considered a separate species (Hill 1994, pp. 543-567; Hill <em>et al</em> 2004, p. 280). It is more likely that this cycad species on Pagan is <em>C. micronesica;</em> however, until identification is confirmed, we consider this a tentative location.</p>

          <p id="p-77" data-page="59435">Yap consists of a group of four
 islands, three of which are separated by water but share a common reef,
 with a total land area of 39 mi<sup>2</sup> (102 km<sup>2</sup>). On Yap, there are three occurrences of <em>Cycas micronesica,</em>
 totaling 288,450 individuals (Marler 2013, in litt). Palau consists of 
three larger islands, Babeldaob, Koror, and Ngeruktabel, and between 250
 and 300 smaller islands referred to as the “Rock Islands.” The total 
land area is 177 mi<sup>2</sup> (458 km<sup>2</sup>). On Palau, there are four occurrences of <em>C. micronesica</em>
 totaling fewer than 2,500 individuals: (1) Two occurrences on 
Ngeruktabel Island, totaling fewer than 900 individuals, (2) one 
occurrence on Ngesomel Island totaling fewer than 600 individuals, and 
(3) possibly as many as 1,000 individuals scattered on the Rock Islands 
(Marler 2013, in litt.). The aulacaspis scale was observed on the main 
islands of Palau in 2008 (Marler 2014, in litt.), and is expected to 
reach Yap as well (Marler 2013, in litt.).</p>

          <p id="p-78" data-page="59435">The nonnative cycad aulacaspis scale quickly causes mortality of all life stages of <em>C. micronesica,</em> preventing reproduction of <em>C. micronesica,</em>
 and leading to its extirpation (see “Factor C. Disease and Predation,” 
below). The magnitude of the ongoing threats of predation by the scale 
and nonnative animals, secondary infestations by other insects, and loss
 of habitat due to development, typhoons, and direct damage and 
destruction by military live-fire training is large, and these threats 
are imminent. We anticipate the effects of climate change will further 
exacerbate many of these threats in the future. Although <em>C. micronesica</em>
 presently is found in relatively high numbers, the factors affecting 
this species can result in very rapid mortality of large numbers of 
individuals. A study by Marler and Lawrence (2012, pp. 239—240) shows 
that if the ongoing negative population density trajectory for <em>C. micronesica</em> established over 4 years is sustained, extirpation of <em>C. micronesica</em>
 from Guam and Rota will occur by 2019. Marler and Lawrence's data show 
that it is reasonable to conclude that, unless an effective biocontrol 
is discovered, the scale will similarly impact the three populations of <em>C. micronesica</em>
 in the Rock Islands of Palau within several years. Additionally, 
frequent travel between Guam and Yap increases the likelihood that the 
scale will reach Yap in the foreseeable future.</p>

            <em>Dendrobium guamense</em> (no common name (NCN)), an 
epiphyte and occasional lithophyte in the orchid family (Orchidaceae), 
is known from the forest ecosystem on Guam, Rota, Saipan (historically),
 and Tinian, and was recently recorded for the first time on Aguiguan 
(Ames 1914, p. 14; Raulerson and Rinehart 1992, p. 98; Quinata 1994, in

Zarones <em>et al.</em> 2015a, in litt.; Zarones <em>et al.</em> 2015c, in litt.). Raulerson (2006, in litt.) cites <em>D. guamense</em>
 as also occurring on Agrihan, however, a voucher record or survey 
report to support this location could not be found. As recently as the 
1980s, this species was common in trees on Guam and Rota, with more than
 12 occurrences on Guam and 17 occurrences on Rota (Raulerson and 
Rinehart 1992, p. 98; Consortium Pacific Herbarium (CPH) 2012a—<em>Online Herbarium Database,</em> 5 pp.).</p>

          <p id="p-80" data-page="59435">Currently, there are at least 
21 occurrences totaling approximately 1,250 individuals distributed on 
the islands of Guam, Rota, Tinian, and Aguiguan; this is more than twice
 as many individuals as were known at the time of the proposed rule. On 
Guam, there are 4 occurrences totaling fewer than 250 individuals 
(Quinata <em>et al.</em> 1994, p. 8; Harrington <em>et al.</em> 2012, in litt). On Rota, at least 15 occurrences of <em>D. guamense</em> are now known, and a recent survey team reported more than 700 individuals of <em>D. guamense</em> on the western third of Rota, represented by seedlings, juveniles, and flowering adults (Harrington <em>et al.</em> 2012, in litt.; Zarones <em>et al.</em> 2015c, in litt.). The presence of multiple generations in a healthy population structure indicates that the status of <em>D. guamense</em> on Rota is better than previously known. This survey team indicated that <em>D. guamense</em>
 is abundant across its preferred habitat on Rota, and subsequently 
suggested that the actual number of individuals could be as high as 
35,000 (Zarones <em>et al.</em> 2015c, in litt.). The Service supports the finding that the number of <em>D. guamense</em>
 individuals on Rota is in the thousands, although we do not agree that 
it is reasonable to assume the species is evenly distributed across the 
island. However, this species is the most abundant of the three 
epiphytic orchids listed as threatened species in this final rule.</p>
          <p id="p-81" data-page="59435">Additionally, Zarones <em>et al.</em> (2015a, in litt.) discovered three individuals of <em>D. guamense</em> on the island of Aguiguan, a new island record for this species. Zarones <em>et al.</em>
 (2015a, in litt.) hypothesize that more individuals may be found on 
Aguiguan and other northern islands within CNMI if more in-depth surveys
 were attempted. There are two reported occurrences on the island of 
Tinian, with an unknown number of individuals (Quinata 1994, in litt.; 
Raulerson 2006, in litt.; CPH 2012a—<em>Online Herbarium Database,</em> 5 pp.). Historically, <em>D. guamense</em> was also known from Saipan, in the forest ecosystem (Raulerson 1987, in litt.; Raulerson 2006, in litt.; CPH 2012a—<em>Online Herbarium Database,</em> 5 pp.). Formerly relatively common on Guam, the remaining few populations of <em>D. guamense</em> and habitat for population enhancement or restoration on Guam is at risk; additionally, <em>D. guamense</em>
 occurrences are limited to just a few individuals on Tinian and 
Aguiguan, with no confirmed individuals on Saipan at this time. <em>Dendrobium guamense</em>
 appears stable and healthy on Rota, however, Raulerson and Rinehart 
(1992, p. 87) warned that, although the endemic orchids on Rota appear 
abundant, they occupy specialized habitat that are in fact rare.</p>

reported solely from Guam; however, because several herbarium records 
reported this species on Rota and Saipan, we investigated other reports 
and taxonomic and genetic analyses concerning the range of this species.
 We believe the Rota and Saipan reports are misidentifications or 
herbarium errors of one or more of the other <em>Hedyotis</em> species also found in the Mariana Islands (Fosberg <em>et al.</em> 1993, pp. 63-79; CPH 2012b—<em>Online Herbarium Database;</em> World Checklist of Select Plant Families (WCSP) 2012a—<em>Online Herbarium Database</em>).

conclude that these few outlying occurrences are actually <em>H. littoralis,</em> not <em>H. longipetiolata</em>

 By 1997, there were about 1,000 individuals on Guam, several hundred on
 Tinian, and fewer than 100 on Saipan, with no known remaining 
individuals on Rota at that time (Wiles in International Union for

eat seedlings of <em>H. longipetiolata</em> (Guam Comprehensive Wildlife

Guam's endangered species list, listed as Vulnerable on IUCN's Red List 
of Threatened Species, and is also a species of concern for Guam's Plant
 Extinction Prevention Program. With roughly 200 individuals remaining 
across its range (Guam, Saipan, Tinian, and Rota), both <em>Heritiera longipetiolata</em>
 and habitat for the recovery of this species are at risk due to ongoing
 habitat loss and destruction from agriculture, urban development, 
nonnative animals and plants, and typhoons. We anticipate the effects of

 Several voucher specimens (preserved and labeled representative whole

The presence of multiple generations of the species indicates that the status of <em>M. walkeri</em> is much better on Rota than previously understood. The number of individual <em>Maesa walkeri</em>
 plants on Rota has been estimated to be in the thousands across the 
Sabana region in small canopy gaps amidst the Pandanus forest and along 
the forest edge; however, this is assuming <em>M. walkeri</em> is evenly distributed (Ulloa 2015, pers. comm. cited in Liske-Clark <em>et al.</em> 2015, in litt.; Liske-Clark <em>et al.</em> 2015, in litt.).</p>

          <p id="p-91" data-page="59437">The Service supports the 
conclusion that there may be several thousand more individuals across 
the Sabana. The cumulative data indicate that <em>Maesa walkeri</em> was
 once relatively abundant on Guam and Rota, and has since declined 
substantially on Guam. The only healthy extant population of <em>M. walkeri</em>
 remains on the Rota Sabana within a very specialized niche habitat that
 is experiencing habitat loss and degradation from nonnative animals 
(deer and rats) and plants, and fire; and is at risk from impacts 
associated with typhoons and future climate change (<em>e.g.,</em> 
potential shift in range to accommodate changes in temperature, 
precipitation, humidity, etc., until the range no longer exists). 
Additionally, habitat on Guam that is essential for the recovery of <em>M. walkeri</em>
 continues to be affected by ongoing habitat loss and destruction from 
agriculture, urban development, nonnative animals and plants, fires, and
 typhoons. The effects of future climate change will likely exacerbate 
many of these impacts. <em>Maesa walkeri</em> is a species of concern for Guam's Plant Extinction Prevention Program.</p>

            <em>Nervilia jacksoniae</em> (NCN), a small herb in the orchid family (Orchidaceae), is found only in the Mariana Islands. Historically, <em>N. jacksoniae</em>
 occurred on the islands of Guam and Rota, in the forest ecosystem, and

(Rinehart and Fosberg 1991, pp. 81-85; Raulerson and Rinehart 1992, p.

          <p id="p-93" data-page="59437">Zarones <em>et al.</em> (2015d, in litt.) recently conducted a small survey on Rota, reporting 167 individuals of <em>N. jacksoniae</em>
 along four transects in just 1.5 hours, and estimated that there may be
 as many as 100,000 individuals distributed across the Pandanus forest 
on the Rota Sabana. This estimate, however, appears to be based on the 
premise that this species is uniformly distributed across area. There 
are also a few scattered occurrences along the areas adjacent to the 
Sabana (Zarones <em>et al.</em> 2015d, in litt.). Our records indicate 
that this species occurs in a more patchy distribution, in specialized 
niche habitat (Harrington <em>et al.</em> 2015, in litt.). Similarly, Falanruw <em>et al.</em>
 (1989, pp. 6-7) noted variation in the distribution of native species 
across the Sabana, referring to the observed variations in forest 
structure as phases of limestone forest. However, we do concur that the 
number of <em>N. jacksoniae</em> individuals is likely to be much higher
 than what has been observed by field biologists on Rota in the past, as
 this species can occur deep within forested areas in the Sabana region 
that are difficult to access due to extremely rugged karst and thick <em>Pandanus</em> forest. Thus, although exact numbers are not known, the best available scientific data do indicate that <em>N. jacksoniae</em> is likely more abundant than was understood at the time of the proposed rule. Nonetheless, the habitat for <em>N. jacksoniae</em> in the Sabana region is experiencing habitat destruction and modification by nonnative animals (<em>i.e.,</em> Philippine deer and rats) and plants, fire, and typhoons.

          <p id="p-97" data-page="59438">In summary, the species <em>Psychotria malaspinae,</em>
 a single island endemic, has been reduced to an estimated five

individuals or small occurrences such as that recently discovered; 
however, these remaining individuals are at risk, due to continued 
habitat loss and destruction from agriculture, urban development, 
nonnative animals and plants, and typhoons. We anticipate the effects of
 climate change will further exacerbate many of these threats in the 
future. Herbivory by pigs and deer, damage by ordnance and live-fire 
training, combined with the effects of low numbers of individuals, which
 results in loss of vigor and genetic representation, and limits its 
ability to compete with other species and adapt to changes in

            <em>Solanum guamense</em> (Biringenas halumtanu, birengenas 
halom tano), a small shrub in the nightshade family (Solanaceae), is 
known only from the Mariana Islands (Merrill 1914, pp. 139-140; Stone 
1970, p. 521; Costion and Lorence 2012, p. 89). Historically, <em>S. guamense</em> was reported from Guam, Rota, Saipan, Tinian, Asuncion, Guguan, and Maug (Stone 1970, p. 521; GBIF 2012e—<em>Online Database;</em> Bishop Museum 2014—<em>Online Database</em>). Currently, <em>S. guamense</em> is known from a single occurrence of one individual on Guam, in the forest ecosystem (Perlman and Wood 1994, pp. 135-136).</p>
          <p id="p-99" data-page="59438">Once ranging across multiple islands, <em>Solanum guamense</em>
 is now highly vulnerable to extinction, as there is only one known 
extant individual of this species. There is a possibility that remaining
 individuals of <em>S. guamense</em> may occur on Asuncion, Guguan, or 
Maug; or any combination of these three islands, possibly even on 
Uracas, as these four islands are designated Wildlife Conservation Areas
 (also referred to as sanctuary islands) by the CNMI constitution 
(Article IX[2]) (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2009, p. 3). This article 
states that no hunting, habitation, nor introduction of any nonnative 
species is allowed (2NMIAC § 85-30.1 330) (Williams <em>et al.</em> 
2009, p. 3). Further, Maug, Asuncion, Guguan, and Uracas are not 
frequently visited for scientific purposes due to their remoteness and 
the associated logistical challenges of planning and cost. <em>Solanum guamense,</em>
 and habitat for its recovery on Guam, Rota, Saipan, and Tinian, are at 
risk, due to continued habitat loss and destruction from agriculture, 
urban development, nonnative animals and plants, and typhoons. We 
anticipate the effects of climate change will further exacerbate many of
 these threats in the future. Herbivory by pigs and deer, combined with 
the effects of low numbers of individuals, which results in loss of 
vigor and genetic representation, and limits its ability to compete with
 other species and adapt to changes in environmental conditions, 
contribute to the decline of <em>S. guamense.</em>

            <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis</em> (NCN), a small to 
medium-sized tree in the dogbane family (Apocynaceae), is historically 
known from Guam and Rota, in the forest ecosystem (University of Guam 
(UOG) 2007, p. 6). The genus is widespread throughout tropical and 
subtropical regions. We originally proposed to list <em>T. rotensis</em> in January of 2004 (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/69-FR-1560">69 FR 1560</a>, January 9, 2004); however, in April 2004 (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/69-FR-18499">69 FR 18499</a>)
 we declined to do so because an authoritative monographic work on the 
genus incorporated this species into an expansive interpretation of the 
widespread species <em>T. pandacaqui.</em> In 2011, a genetic study was 
conducted on specimens from Rota, Guam, Asia, and the Pacific, to 
determine if those individuals on the Mariana Islands are a monophyletic
 lineage. The study determined that <em>T. rotensis</em> is a valid species, distinct from the widespread <em>T. pandacaqui</em> (Reynaud 2012, 27 pp. + appendices).</p>
          <p id="p-101" data-page="59438">In 2004, <em>T. rotensis</em> was known from 8 individuals on Rota, and at least 250 individuals on Guam (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/69-FR-1560">69 FR 1560</a>;
 January 9, 2004). In 2007, more than 21,000 individuals were found 
throughout Andersen AFB on Guam, with a population structure 
representing seedling, juveniles, and reproductive, mature individuals 
(UOG 2007 p. 4). In 2014, the CNMI DLNR completed a survey of all known 
locations of naturally occurring and outplanted individuals of <em>T. rotensis</em>
 on Rota, and found nine living naturally occurring individuals and one 
dead individual (CNMI DLNR 2014, in litt.). These were spread across the
 western, southern, and eastern parts of the island. Additionally, there
 are 30 surviving outplanted individuals, ranging in size from 4 to 23 
ft (1.3 to 7 m), spread out across the island (J. Manglona, T. Reyes, R.
 Ulloa, pers. comm. 2014 cited in CNMI DLNR 2014, in litt.). Therefore, 
the best scientific data currently available indicate that on Guam, <em>T. rotensis</em>
 is known from 6 occurrences totaling approximately 21,000 individuals 
(M and E Pacific, Inc. 1998, p. 61; UOG 2007, pp. 32-42), and on Rota, <em>T. rotensis</em> is known from 9 individuals (CNMI DLNR 2014, in litt.).</p>
          <p id="p-102" data-page="59438">Despite the increased number of known individuals of <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis,</em>
 populations of this species on Guam and Rota are at risk due to 
continued habitat loss and destruction from agriculture, urban 
development, nonnative animals and plants, fires, and typhoons; combined
 with ordnance and live-fire training. We anticipate the effects of 
climate change will further exacerbate many of these threats in the 
future. The greatest concern regarding this species is not of population
 size or structure, but the close proximity of occurrences to an area 
that is likely to be developed according to the proposed AFB and Navy 
base expansions (UOG 2007, p. 5; JGPO-NavFac Pacific 2010a, 2010b;

There is discussion among botanists as to whether or not <em>T. homosepala</em> is either the same as a commonly occurring species found throughout Malaysia and the Philippines or a variety of that species (<em>T. glabra</em>) (Costion and Lorence 2012, pp. 92-93; Gawel <em>et al.</em> 2013, in litt.). <em>Tinospora homosepala</em> differs from <em>T. glabra</em>
 in having equal-sized sepals (petal-like structures of the calyx) as 
opposed to the outer sepals being much smaller than inner sepals as in <em>T. glabra</em>

          <p id="p-104" data-page="59439">While these discussions note that additional research on the taxonomy of <em>Tinospora homosepala</em>
 is appropriate to address questions, no changes to the currently 
accepted taxonomy have been proposed. Though Forman (1981, p. 419) notes
 that if fruits of <em>T. homosepala</em> are discovered and they are indistinguishable from <em>T. glabra,</em> it may be preferable to reduce <em>T. homosepala</em> to subspecific rank under <em>T. glabra.</em>
 It should also be noted that any future reduction in rank from full 
species status to that of a subspecies or variety would not, in itself, 
disqualify this taxon from protection under the Act. All known 
individuals of <em>T. homosepala</em> on Guam are said to be males that reproduce clonally (Yoshioka 2008, p. 15; Gawel <em>et al.</em>
 2013, in litt.). Clonal reproduction limits genetic diversity, reducing
 the ability of the species to form new genetic combinations to fit 
changing environmental conditions (Stebbins 1957, p. 352).</p>
          <p id="p-105" data-page="59439">In summary, the species <em>T. homosepala,</em>
 a single island endemic, has been reduced to roughly 30 individuals on 
Guam, and it is possible that no female representatives of this species 
remain. These few remaining individuals of the species are at risk of 
extinction, due to continued habitat loss and destruction from nonnative
 animals and plants, and typhoons, and by genetic limitations as a 
result of the possible loss of potential sexual reproduction. We 
anticipate the effects of climate change will further exacerbate many of
 these threats in the future.</p>

            <em>Tuberolabium guamense</em> (NCN) (<em>Trachoma guamense</em> is a synonym), an epiphyte in the orchid family (Orchidaceae), is known only from the Mariana Islands. Historically, <em>T. guamense</em> was reported from the islands of Guam, Rota, Tinian, and Aguiguan (Raulerson and Rinehart 1992, p. 127; CPH 2012f—<em>Online Herbarium Database;</em> GBIF 2012f—<em>Online Database</em>). The Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew's online database (WCSP 2012d—<em>Online Database</em>) describes the range for <em>T. guamense</em>
 as the Mariana Islands and the Cook Islands; however, we were unable to
 confirm this with herbarium specimens as there is not a single voucher 
that cites the Cook Islands as a collection site (CPH 2012f—<em>Online Herbarium Database;</em> GBIF 2012f—<em>Online Database;</em> Smithsonian Institution 2014—<em>Online Herbarium Database</em>). In 1992, <em>T. guamense</em>
 was found in “trees and shrubs all over the island” (Raulerson and 
Rinehart 1992, p. 127), and the Consortium of Pacific Herbaria has 
records of 22 collections from Guam, 5 collections from Rota, 15 
collections from Tinian, and 3 collections from Aguiguan (CPH 2012f—<em>Online database</em>).</p>
          <p id="p-107" data-page="59439">Currently, <em>T. guamense</em>
 is known from seven occurrences: one occurrence of one individual on 
Guam and six occurrences on Rota, in the forest ecosystem (Gawel <em>et al.</em> 2013, in litt.; Harrington <em>et al.</em> 2012, in litt.; Zarones <em>et al.</em>
 2015c, in litt.). It is possible that a few more individuals are 
scattered across native forests on Guam. The number of occurrences on 
Rota represents an increase over those known at the time of the proposed
 rule. A recent survey on Rota (Zarones <em>et al.</em> 2015c, in litt.) reported finding 239 individuals of <em>Tuberolabium guamense</em>
 along 6 of 18 transects surveyed on the Sabana, with a healthy 
population structure consisting of seedlings, juveniles, and flowering 
adults. Zarones <em>et al.</em> (2015c, in litt.) estimate that the actual number of <em>T. guamense</em> individuals on the Sabana may be as high as 14,600; however, this appears to assume that <em>T. guamense</em>
 is evenly distributed across the Sabana region. The Service does not 
concur that this species is evenly or uniformly distributed across the 
Sabana, consequently we conclude that 14,600 individuals is likely an 
overestimate. For example, a particularly noteworthy observation from 
these recent surveys is that <em>T. guamense</em> seems to occur solely in native canopy trees, with the majority of individuals found on <em>Hernandia labyrinthica, Premna obtusifolia,</em> and <em>Elaeocarpus joga</em> (Zarones <em>et al.</em> 2015c, in litt.). As these native canopy trees are not distributed uniformly across the landscape, neither would we expect <em>T. guamense</em> to be evenly or continuously distributed across the Sabana. However, we do agree that the survey results of Zarones <em>et al.</em> (2015c, in litt.) indicate that the species <em>Tuberolabium guamense</em> is currently more abundant on Rota than previously known.</p>
          <p id="p-108" data-page="59439">In summary, populations of <em>Tuberolabium guamense</em> are decreasing from their initial abundance observed on Guam, and although new data show a higher number of <em>T. guamense</em> individuals than previously thought on Rota, <em>T. guamense</em>
 still occupies very specialized niche habitat in the Sabana region. 
More than 20 years ago, Raulerson and Rinehart (1992, p. 87) stated that
 although the orchids may appear abundant on the limestone ridges of 
Guam and Rota, “the habitats are limited and in reality these orchids 
are very rare.” Additionally, they wrote, “The islands are small and 
habitats are rapidly being destroyed by human activity” (Raulerson and 
Rinehart 1992, p. 87). Although numbers of <em>T. guamense</em> are estimated to be possibly in the thousands on Rota (Zarones <em>et al.</em>
 2015c, in litt.), because of the specialized niche habitat occupied by 
this species we are not in full agreement with this estimate, which 
relies on an assumption of uniform distribution. Furthermore, habitat 
for the recovery of this species is considered at risk across its range.
 The remaining representatives of this species and its habitat are 
vulnerable to ongoing threats posed by the continued habitat loss and 
destruction from agriculture, urban development, nonnative animals and 
plants, fires, typhoons, and herbivory by slugs. We anticipate the 
effects of climate change will further exacerbate many of these threats 
in the future.</p>

          <h4 id="h-29">Pacific Sheath-Tailed Bat (Mariana Subspecies)</h4>
          <p id="p-109" data-page="59439">The Mariana subspecies of the Pacific sheath-tailed bat (<em>Emballonura semicaudata rotensis</em>) (payeyi, paischeey) is a small, insectivorous (insect-feeding), sac-winged bat in the family <em>Emballonuridae,</em>
 an old-world group with an extensive tropical distribution. It is a 
relatively small bat species with an approximate forearm length of about
 1.8 in (45 mm) long. Males weigh 0.2 ounces (oz.) (5.5 grams (g)) on 
average, and females weigh about 0.24 oz. (6.9 g) (Wiles <em>et al.</em>
 2011, p. 303). The pelage varies in color from brown to dark brown 
dorsally with a paler underbody (Walker and Paradiso 1983, p. 211). The 
common name “sheath-tailed” bat refers to the nature of the tail 
attachment, which involves a short, narrow tail emerging from a more 
anterior sheath-like membrane (Walker and Paradiso 1983, p. 209).</p>

          <p id="p-110" data-page="59439">Taxonomically, four subspecies of Pacific sheath-tailed bats are currently recognized: <em>Emballonura semicaudata rotensis,</em> endemic to the Mariana Islands (Guam and the CNMI, referred to here as the Mariana subspecies); <em>E. s. sulcata</em> in Chuuk and Pohnpei (Pohnpei subspecies); <em>E. s. palauensis</em> in Palau (Palau subspecies); and <em>E. s. semicaudata</em>
 in American and Independent Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, and Vanuatu (South 
Pacific subspecies) (Koopman 1997, pp. 358-360; Oyler-McCance <em>et al.</em> 2013, pp. 1,030-1,036). Recent genetic analysis conducted by Oyler-McCance <em>et al.</em> (2013, p. 1,030) found notable genetic differences between <em>E. s. rotensis, E. s. palauensis,</em> and <em>E. s. semicaudata;</em> the magnitude of these differences was greater than what is typically reported between <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59440"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59440" data-page="59440" data-text="Start Printed Page 59440" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59440}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59440</span></span></span>mammalian
 subspecies. In addition to divergence from the other three subspecies, 
which would argue against reintroduction efforts based on translocations
 of individuals between subspecific localities, the study found no 
genetic variation between the 12 <em>E. s. rotensis</em> individuals collected and examined (Oyler-McCance <em>et al.,</em> 2013, p. 1,035), which increases the risks associated with small number of individuals and populations.</p>

          <p id="p-111" data-page="59440">Once common and widespread 
throughout Polynesia and Micronesia, the Pacific sheath-tailed bat, 
represented by the four subspecies, is the only insectivorous bat 
recorded from a large part of this area (Hutson <em>et al.</em> 2001, p. 138; Gorresen <em>et al.</em> 2009, p. 331; Wiles <em>et al..</em> 2011, p. 299; Oyler-McCance <em>et al.</em> 2013, p. 1,030; Valdez <em>et al.</em> 2013, p. 301). In the Caroline Islands, large numbers of individuals of the sheath-tailed bat subspecies <em>Emballonura semicaudata palauensis</em> were readily observed by Wiles <em>et al.</em>
 during studies in the 1990s (1997, p. 224). However, the other three 
subspecies of the bat have declined dramatically, including in 
Independent and American Samoa and Fiji (Bruner and Pratt 1979, p. 3; 
Grant <em>et al.</em> 1994, pp. 133-134; Wiles <em>et al.</em> 1997, pp.
 222-223; Wiles and Worthington 2002, pp. 17-19). In American Samoa, a 
decrease in populations of the sheath-tailed bat subspecies <em>E. s. semicaudata</em> was noted as early as the 1970s (Grant <em>et al.</em>
 1994, pp. 133-134). Researchers have identified several possible 
factors for the past and ongoing decline of the Pacific sheath-tailed 
bat throughout its range, including human disturbance of caves for guano
 mining and shelter during World War II, bombing and shelling during 
World War II, indiscriminate use of pesticides, predation by monitor 
lizards, rats, and brown treesnakes, increasingly isolated populations, 
and loss of foraging habitat due to human conversion and destruction and
 alteration by typhoons and nonnative plants and animals (Gorresen <em>et al.</em> 2009, p. 339; Valdez <em>et al.</em> 2011, p. 302; Wiles <em>et al.</em> 2011, pp. 306-307; and Oyler-McCance <em>et al.</em> 2013, p. 1,035).</p>

          <p id="p-112" data-page="59440">In the Mariana Islands, fossil evidence indicates the Mariana subspecies (<em>Emballonura semicaudata rotensis</em>)
 (hereafter simply referred to as the Pacific sheath-tailed bat or 
simply “bat,” unless noted otherwise), was common on both Guam and Rota,
 and somewhat less common on the island of Tinian (Steadman 1999, p. 
321; Wiles and Worthington 2002, pp. 1-3; Wiles <em>et al.</em> 2011, p. 299). Historically, populations of the Pacific sheath-tailed bat were reported from Saipan (Wiles <em>et al.</em>
 2011, p. 299), and possibly on Anatahan and Maug as well (Lemke 1986, 
pp. 743-745). The Mariana subspecies of the Pacific sheath-tailed bat is
 now restricted to a single remaining population on the small (2.7 
square-mile (sq mi; 7 square-kilometer (sq km)) island of Aguiguan, 
where it was first observed in 1984 (Wiles <em>et al.</em> 2011, p. 
299). The bat has clearly experienced a precipitous reduction from its 
wider historical range in the Mariana Islands (formerly Guam, Rota, 
Saipan, Tinian, and Aguiguan), which can reasonably be assumed to be 
coincident with a significant decline in abundance of individuals.</p>

          <p id="p-113" data-page="59440">Currently, the Aguiguan bat 
population consists of several roosting colonies estimated to number 
between 359 to 466 individuals (Wiles and Worthington 2002, p. 15; Wiles
 2007, pers. comm.; O'Shea and Valdez 2009, pp. 2-3; Wiles <em>et al.</em> 2011, p. 299; Oyler-McCance <em>et al.</em> 2013, p. 1,030). During several field surveys between 1995 and 2008, Wiles <em>et al.</em>
 (2011, pp. 299-305), examined a total of 114 caves on the island, of 
which approximately 8 caves contained roosting bats, with 4 caves 
consistently occupied during the 13-year study period. Colonies ranged 
in size from 333 bats in the largest colony, to between 1 and 64 one 
bats in the other colonies (Wiles <em>et al.</em> 2011, pp. 301-303).</p>

          <p id="p-114" data-page="59440">Despite observed declines in 
populations of most Pacific sheath-tailed bat subspecies elsewhere, as 
well as with the Marianas subspecies in general across the Marianas 
Archipelago, researchers have recorded a small increase in the observed 
number of bats on Aguiguan in past years, starting with 98 individuals 
in 1995, up to 285 to 364 bats in 2003, and 359 to 466 bats in 2008 
(Wiles <em>et al.</em> 2011, p. 304). The researchers used population 
growth models to ensure that this apparent increase is biologically 
plausible, as opposed to a potential artifact of variable survey 
methods; they conclude that the increase is most likely real, while 
cautioning that additional data and analysis are needed. They also 
suggest that the single remaining population of the Mariana subspecies 
of Pacific sheath-tailed bat on Aguiguan is more likely limited by 
foraging habitat, and not by roosting habitat (Wiles <em>et al.</em> 
2011, pp. 304-305). Although this very small population on the tiny 
island of Aguiguan appears to be relatively healthy, it has limited 
foraging habitat, which is threatened by feral goats, nonnative plants, 
development, and typhoons; and the bats are at risk from predation by 
rats, monitor lizards, and brown treesnakes.</p>

          <p id="p-115" data-page="59440">Breeding of Pacific 
sheath-tailed bats is timed to coincide with offspring born during the 
onset of the rainy season when there are predictably greater numbers of 
insect prey. Pacific sheath-tailed bat females produce one pup per 
litter annually, which translates into relatively low fecundity for the 
species (Wiles <em>et al.</em> 2011, p. 303). The bats are nocturnal and
 roost during the day in a wide range of cave-types, including 
overhanging cliffs, limestone solution caves, crevices, and lava tubes, 
(Grant <em>et al.</em> 1994, pp. 134-135; O'Shea and Valdez 2009, pp. 105-108), and emerge shortly before sunset to forage on insects (Craig <em>et al.</em> 1993, p. 51; Wiles and Worthington 2002, p. 13; Wiles <em>et al.</em> 2011, pp. 301-303). Unlike the Pohnpei subspecies, which utilizes hollow trees for roosting (Wiles <em>et al.</em>
 2011, p. 305), the Mariana subspecies of the Pacific sheath-tailed bat 
appears to be cave-dependent on Aguiguan, which has approximately 114 
caves of various sizes classified from small to large (Wiles <em>et al.</em>
 2011, pp. 301-302). On the Northern Mariana Islands, which contain far 
fewer caves due to their relatively young geologic age and volcanic 
origin, it is possible that the presence of the predatory monitor lizard
 may preclude the use of hollow trees as roosting sites by the Pacific 
sheath-tailed bat (Wiles 2011, p. 306).</p>

          <p id="p-116" data-page="59440">The Pacific sheath-tailed bat is also known to share roosting caves with Mariana swiftlets (birds, <em>Aerodramus</em> spp.) (Lemke 1986, pp. 744-745; Tarburton 2002, pp. 106-107; and Wiles and Worthington 2002, pp. 7, 13; Wiles <em>et al.</em> 2011, p. 302). During several field studies between 1995 and 2008, Wiles <em>et al.</em>
 (2011, pp. 302-303), observed Mariana swiftlets roosting in seven out 
of eight caves co-occupied by the bat, albeit within somewhat segregated
 portions of the cave. In the same 1995-2008 study, Wiles <em>et al.</em> (2011, p. 302) also determined that bats on Aguiguan prefer caves characterized as “large” (over 1,076 ft<sup>2</sup> (100 m<sup>2</sup>) in floor area with ceiling heights reaching 16 to 98 ft (5 to 30 m)) (see “Cave Ecosystem,” in the proposed rule (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/79-FR-59364">79 FR 59364</a>;
 October 1, 2014), for further cave description). Researchers also found
 occupied caves to be fairly constant in both temperature and humidity, 
with conditions homogenous and consistent between occupied caves, 
including most seemingly suitable, unoccupied caves (Wiles <em>et al.</em> 2011, p. 305).</p>

          <p id="p-117" data-page="59440">Some information about the 
Pacific sheath-tailed bat's biology and life history, including

 the bat's small size, secretive habits, difficulty of capture, 
non-specific roosting sites, and—following its extirpation from most of 
the islands in its range in the Marianas—the remoteness of the sole 
remaining population (Wiles and Worthington 2002, p. 19; Esselstyn <em>et al.</em> 2004, p. 304; Wiles <em>et al.</em> 2011, p. 305). Funded by the Department of the Navy and the Service, more recent studies including Gorresen <em>et al.</em> 2009 (pp. 331-340), O'Shea and Valdez 2009 (pp. 95-97), Valdez <em>et al.</em> 2011 (pp. 301-309), Wiles <em>et al.</em> 2011 (pp. 299-309), and Oyler-McCance <em>et al.</em>
 2013 (pp. 1,030-1,036), have provided us with new information about the
 species. For example, we now know from fecal pellets collected from 
caves on Aguiguan that Pacific sheath-tailed bats there consume a 
diverse array of small-sized (0.078-0.314 in (2-8 mm)) insects, 
including ants, bees, and wasps (Hymenoptera), moths (Lepidoptera), and 
beetles (Coleoptera), as their primary prey (O'Shea and Valdez 2009, pp.
 63-65; Valdez <em>et al.</em> 2011, pp. 301-307).</p>

          <p id="p-118" data-page="59441">Earlier surveys of habitat use
 on Aguiguan in 2003 revealed that the Pacific sheath-tailed bat forages
 almost entirely in native and nonnative forests near their roosting 
caves, ignoring non-forested habitats on the island (Esselstyn <em>et al.</em>
 2004, p. 307). Outside of the Mariana Islands, Bruner and Pratt (1979, 
p. 3) observed similar behavior, with the other subspecies of Pacific 
sheath-tailed bats (<em>Emballonura semicaudata semicaudata, E. s. sulcata,</em> and <em>E. s. palauensis</em>)
 foraging only in native forests. New evidence from recent studies 
appears to confirm prior observations regarding the association between 
bat foraging and native limestone forest. For example, the 
aforementioned dietary study by Valdez <em>et al.</em> 2011 (pp. 
301-307), showed that the bat feeds on certain insects, including 
barklice (Pscoptera) and fungus-feeding beetles, each very specific to 
forest habitat on Aguiguan. A 2008 study analyzed the bat's specific 
method of echolocation (use of sonar to navigate) and flight pattern, 
both of which are similar to other insect-eating, forest-foraging bats, 
to identify a correlation between foraging activity and roosting site 
proximity to native forest canopy and the height and nature of that 
forest canopy (O'Shea and Valdez 2009, pp. 105-108; Gorresen <em>et al.</em> 2009, p. 331). The Gorresen <em>et al.</em> study (2009, p. 336) as well as Wiles <em>et al.</em>
 (2011 p. 305), point to the high number of unoccupied caves on Aguiguan
 and suggest it is likely the amount of native forest cover, not the 
number of suitable roost sites, that may be the main factor currently 
limiting the island's Pacific sheath-tailed bat population. Some 
researchers go further to point out that insectivorous bats relying on 
forested areas for foraging are at greater risk of extinction than those
 which employ a wider range of foraging methods (Gorresen <em>et al.</em>
 2009, p. 339). Researchers familiar with the status of the Pacific 
sheath-tailed bat readily identify an almost complete lack of native 
forest regeneration on Aguiguan and the ever-present possibility of 
forest destruction by hurricanes as two factors threatening the species'
 continued existence in the Mariana Islands (Gorresen <em>et al.</em> 2009, p. 339; Wiles <em>et al.</em> 2011, pp. 306-307).</p>

          <p id="p-119" data-page="59441">In summary, the Mariana subspecies of the Pacific sheath-tailed bat (<em>Emballonura semicaudata rotensis</em>),
 now reduced to a single, remaining population on Aguiguan, has shown a 
clear and significant decline from its original wide range across at 
least four, and possibly as many as six, of the Mariana Islands. With 
recent research suggesting inter-genetic homogeneity within its own 
population, we now understand that the Mariana Islands Pacific 
sheath-tailed bat is at especially great risk due to its small 
population size and isolation from other subspecies. Despite the small 
increases in abundance of the sole remaining population noted in recent 
years, the Mariana subspecies of the Pacific sheath-tailed bat faces 
threats of continued habitat loss and destruction. Additionally, 
predation by monitor lizards, and potential predation by the brown 
treesnake, may contribute to the further decline of the species.</p>
          <h4 id="h-30">Slevin's Skink</h4>
          <p id="p-120" data-page="59441">Slevin's skink (<em>Emoia slevini,</em>
 gualiik halumtanu, ghóluuf) is a small lizard in the reptile family 
Scincidae, the largest lizard family in number of worldwide species. 
Slevin's skink was first described in 1972 by Walter C. Brown and 
Marjorie V.C. Falanruw, which is the most recent and accepted taxonomy 
(Brown and Falanruw 1972, p. 107). It is the only lizard endemic to the 
Mariana Islands and is on the Government of Guam's Endangered Species 
List (Fritts and Rodda 1993, p. 3; Rodda <em>et al.</em> 1997, p. 568; 
Rodda 2002, p. 2; CNMI Division of Fish and Wildlife (DFW) 2005, p. 174;
 GDAWR 2006, p. 107; Guam Department of Agriculture 2014, in litt.). 
Slevin's skink previously occurred on the southern Mariana Islands 
(Guam, Cocos Island, Rota, Tinian, and Aguiguan), where it is now 
extirpated, except from Cocos Island off Guam, where it was recently 
rediscovered (Fritts and Rodda 1993, p. 2; Steadman 1999; Lardner 2013, 
in litt.). Local skink experts hypothesize that the individuals on Cocos
 Island may be a distinct species or subspecies from Slevin's skinks in 
the northern islands, and are currently conducting a genetic analysis to
 determine the taxonomic status (Reed 2015, in litt.).</p>

          <p id="p-121" data-page="59441">Surveys conducted in the 1980s
 and 1990s show that Slevin's skink was once present on the northern 
islands of Sarigan, Guguan, Alamagan, Pagan, and Asuncion (Vogt 1997, in
 litt.; Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005, pp. 174-175; GDAWR 2006, p. 107); 
however, none were captured on Anatahan or Agrihan or ever reported 
historically from these islands (Rodda <em>et al.</em> 1991, p. 202; Berger <em>et al.</em>
 2005, p. 175). The skink has not yet been reported from the southern 
island of Saipan, or the northern islands of Farallon de Medinilla, 
Maug, or Uracas. The densest population was on Alamagan (island area of 
2,800 ac; 1,130 ha) in the early 1990s, but researchers believe that 
overgrazing by introduced ungulates may preclude the long-term viability
 of that population (Fritts and Rodda 1993, p. 1; Rodda 2002, pp. 1-3). 
The most recent surveys of Alamagan were completed in 2000. Based on 
their survey efforts, Cruz <em>et al.</em> (2000, pp. 24, 26) reported a
 capture rate of approximately 0.019 Slevin's skinks per trap hour for 
Alamagan, which was lower than the capture rate of 0.033 per trap hour 
reported by McCoid <em>et al.</em> (1995, as cited in Cruz <em>et al.</em>
 2000, p. 24) 5 years earlier. The authors state that this may be 
indicative of a decline in the population of Slevin's skink on the 
island, but also note that it may be due to seasonal fluctuations 
(sampling was limited to only 2 nights at a single location in June 
2000); they conclude that more surveys are needed (Cruz <em>et al.</em> 2000, p. 26).</p>

          <p id="p-122" data-page="59441">After the eradication of feral
 ungulates from the island of Sarigan in 1998, the catch rate of skinks 
(number of lizards captured per hour) roughly quadrupled in a survey 
conducted in 2007 (Vogt 2007, p. 5-5; Kessler 2011, p. 322), which 
indicates the skinks are doing much better on Sarigan and that ungulates
 played a role in their prior decline. Numbers of Slevin's skinks 
trapped on Asuncion in surveys conducted in 2008 were quite low; only 3 
individuals were captured following 350 hours of effort at 20 trap 
stations, translating to 0.008 per trap hour (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2008, pp. 36). Recent intensive surveys on Pagan conducted in 2010 by Reed <em>et al.</em>
 (2010, pp. 22, 27) found no Slevin's skinks, leading some experts to 
postulate that Slevin's skink may be potentially extirpated on Pagan, <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59442"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59442" data-page="59442" data-text="Start Printed Page 59442" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59442}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59442</span></span></span>if
 not certainly rare, but ultimately concluding that it is too early to 
make a definitive judgment (Rodda 2014, in litt.). The current status of
 Slevin's skink on Guguan is unknown.</p>
          <p id="p-123" data-page="59442">Slevin's skink measures 3 in 
(77 mm) from snout to cloaca vent (the opening for reproductive and 
excretory ducts), although length can vary slightly (Vogt and Williams 
2004, p. 65). Fossil remains indicate its prehistoric size was much 
larger, up to 4.3 in (110 mm) in length (Rodda 2010, p. 3). Slevin's 
skink is darkly colored, from olive to brown, with darker flecks in a 
checkerboard pattern, and a light orange to bright yellow underside 
(Vogt and Williams 2004, p. 65). Their skin tends to be shiny, and is 
very durable and tough. Juveniles may appear cream-colored (Vogt and 
Williams 2004, p. 65; Rodda 2010, p. 3).</p>

          <p id="p-124" data-page="59442">Slevin's skink is a 
fast-moving, alert, insectivorous lizard, typically found on the ground 
or at ground level, and is active during the day. The species occurs in 
the forest ecosystem, with most individuals observed on the forest floor
 using leaf litter as cover (Brown and Falanruw 1972, p. 110; Cruz <em>et al.</em>
 2000, p. 21; GDAWR 2006, p. 107; Lardner 2013, in litt.). Occasionally,
 individuals were observed in low hollows of tree trunks (Brown and 
Falanruw 1972, p. 110). It is a social species, seen often in the 
company of other individuals, including other nonnative skink species 
(Vogt and Williams 2004, pp. 59, 65). The females are oviparous, with a 
normal clutch size of two (Zug 2013, p. 184; Rodda 2014, in litt.). 
Other specific life-history or habitat requirements of Slevin's skink 
are not well documented (Rodda 2002, p. 3; Zug 2013, p. 184).</p>

          <p id="p-125" data-page="59442">Slevin's skink was most 
numerous in the Mariana Islands before the introduction of other 
competing lizards and predators, and loss of native forest (Vogt and 
Williams 2004, p. 65; Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005, p. 175). After World 
War II, Slevin's skink had notably vanished from the larger southern 
Mariana Islands (Fritts and Rodda 1993, p. 4), which suggests the 
species may be sensitive to habitat destruction or changes in land use 
practices (Fritts and Rodda 1993, p. 4; Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005, p. 
174). Likewise, as noted above, the observed four-fold increase in 
captures of Slevin's skink on Sarigan following the removal of nonnative
 ungulates from that island (Vogt 2007, p. 5-5; Kessler 2011, p. 322) 
indicates that nonnative ungulates have a negative impact on the 
species. Slevin's skink had not been recorded on Guam since 1945 and had
 not been observed on Cocos Island since the early 1990s (Rodda and 
Fritts 1992, p. 171; Campbell 2011, in litt.), until a specimen was 
captured on Cocos Island in January of 2011 (following eradication of 
rats from that island; Campbell 2011, pers. comm.). Over half of Cocos 
Island is developed for a hotel, and it is a tourist destination (Fritts
 and Rodda 1993, p. 2). Only about 25 ac (10 ha) of suitable habitat for
 Slevin's skink is available on Cocos Island, and this is periodically 
overwashed during typhoons (Fritts and Rodda 1993, pp. 2, 5), thus there
 is little if any stable suitable habitat permanently available on the 
island.</p>
          <p id="p-126" data-page="59442">The northern islands of its 
known occurrence provide less than 19,843 ac (8,030 ha) of land area, 
not all of which is suitable habitat. Slevin's skink is no longer found 
on the larger southern islands of Guam, Rota, and Tinian, which, 
combined, provided the great majority of its formerly occupied range, 
totaling an estimated 179,900 ac (72,800 ha). Even without considering 
its potential recent extirpation from Pagan, based on these numbers it 
is apparent that Slevin's skink has likely been reduced to just 10 
percent of its overall historical range, and its remaining suitable 
habitat is a subset of that area.</p>

          <p id="p-127" data-page="59442">In summary, once widespread, 
the remaining known populations of Slevin's skink are made up of a few 
individuals on Cocos Island, where habitat is limited and subject to 
overwashing, and occurrences of undetermined numbers of individuals on 
Alamagan, Guguan, Sarigan, and Asuncion. Slevin's skink persists in low 
numbers observed on Cocos Island, is possibly extirpated from Pagan, and
 has not been reobserved on Guam, Rota, Tinian, or Aguiguan. Of the nine
 islands from which it was formerly known, Slevin's skink is known to be
 recovering to some degree from the effects of past threats (nonnative 
ungulates) only on the island of Sarigan; however, other threats remain 
on this island (<em>e.g.,</em> rats). Overall, Slevin's skink has been 
lost from 90 percent of its former range. Because populations are 
reduced in distribution and likely small, we conclude the remaining 
populations of Slevin's skink are at risk, due to continued habitat loss
 and destruction from agriculture, development, nonnative animals (feral
 pigs, cows, and goats), and typhoons. We anticipate the effects of 
future climate change will further exacerbate many of these threats in 
the future. Predation by rats, monitor lizards, and possible predation 
by the brown treesnake (if the snake is introduced to other islands), 
also pose ongoing threats to Slevin's skink.</p>
          <h4 id="h-31">Mariana Eight-Spot Butterfly</h4>
          <p id="p-128" data-page="59442">The Mariana eight-spot butterfly (<em>Hypolimnas octocula marianensis</em>)
 (abbabang, libweibwogh), a butterfly in the Nymphalidae family, is 
known solely from the islands of Guam and Saipan, in the forest 
ecosystem (Schreiner and Nafus 1996, p. 2; Schreiner and Nafus 1997, p. 
26). It may be extirpated from Saipan (Schreiner and Nafus 1997, p. 26).
 This subspecies was originally described by Butler and is recognized as
 a distinct taxon in Swezey (1942, p. 35), the most recent and accepted 
taxonomy for this species. Like most nymphalid butterflies, orange and 
black are the two primary colors exhibited by this subspecies. The males
 are smaller than the females by at least a third or more in size. Males
 are predominantly black with an orange stripe running vertically on 
each wing. The stripe on the hindwings exhibits small black dots in a 
vertical row. Overall, the females appear more orange in color than the 
males, and black bands across the apical (top) margins of both pair of 
wings are exhibited. Along the inner margin of these black bands, large 
white spots are exhibited across the entire length of the wings 
(Schreiner and Nafus 1997, pp. 15, 26-27). The caterpillar larva of this
 species is black in color with red spikes and a black head, 
differentiating it from similar-appearing caterpillars including <em>Hypolimnas bolina</em> and <em>H. anomala</em> (Schreiner and Nafus 1996, p. 10; Schreiner and Nafus 1997, p. 26).</p>
          <p id="p-129" data-page="59442">The larvae of this butterfly feed on two native plants, <em>Procris pedunculata</em> (no common name) and <em>Elatostema calcareum</em>
 (tapun ayuyu) (Schreiner and Nafus, 1996, p. 1). Both of these forest 
herbs (family Urticaceae) are found only on karst substrate within the 
forest ecosystem, draped over boulders and small cliffs (Schreiner and 
Nafus 1996, p. 1; Rubinoff 2013, in litt.). Surveys show that these two 
host plants are no longer observed in places where nonnative ungulates 
can reach them easily, and in the rare case that a plant grows long 
enough to extend beyond the protection of the extremely rugged limestone
 karst, browsing damage is observed (Rubinoff 2013, in litt.; Lindstrom 
and Benedict 2014, pp. 29, 32-35; Rubinoff 2014, in litt.). The 
eradication of ungulates would allow these host plants to expand their 
range onto less rugged karst, consequently increasing their availability
 for the Mariana eight-spot butterfly. When adult butterflies were 
observed, they were always in proximity to the host plants (Rubinoff 
2011, in litt.; Rubinoff 2013, p. 1). The two host plants have <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59443"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59443" data-page="59443" data-text="Start Printed Page 59443" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59443}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59443</span></span></span>been
 recorded on the islands of Guam, Rota, Saipan, and Tinian (Schreiner 
and Nafus 1996, p. 2; Schreiner and Nafus 1997, p. 26; Harrington <em>et al.</em>
 2012, in litt.; Rubinoff and Haines 2012, in litt.; Rubinoff, in litt. 
2013). However, despite recent surveys (2011-2013) on Rota, Tinian, and 
Saipan, the Mariana eight-spot butterfly is currently known only from 
the island of Guam (Schreiner and Nafus 1996, p. 2; Schreiner and Nafus 
1997, p. 26; Rubinoff and Haines 2012, in litt.; Rubinoff 2013, in 
litt.).</p>

          <p id="p-130" data-page="59443">Recent surveys conducted 
across Guam confirmed the occurrence of the Mariana eight-spot butterfly
 in six areas on the island (Lindstrom and Benedict 2014, p. 9). This 
survey report did not provide estimates for the number of individuals 
per population. Lindstrom and Benedict (2014, p. 9) stated that there 
are currently only 6 populations of this species, not the 11 populations
 cited in the October 1, 2014, proposed rule (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/79-FR-59364">79 FR 59364</a>).
 We do not believe this difference reflects a reduction in the number of
 populations since the publication of the proposed rule, however. In 
part, this discrepancy in numbers may lie in the definition of a 
“current population.” We distinguish populations as separate if they are
 3,280 ft (1,000 m) or more apart, and define <em>current</em> as a 
report within 20 years from the present date. In addition, although 
quite extensive, the surveys conducted by Lindstrom and Benedict and 
colleagues (2014, pp. 1-44) did not survey all previously cited current 
occurrences for the Mariana eight-spot butterfly on Guam (Schreiner and 
Nafus 1996, p. 2; Schreiner and Nafus 1997, p. 26; Rubinoff 2011, in 
litt.; Rubinoff and Haines 2012, in litt.; Rubinoff 2013, in litt.), so 
some may have been overlooked. Finally, a lack of observation on select 
transects at previously reported sites does not necessarily translate to
 a complete absence of the species at that location; the lack of 
observation may be more indicative that the species exists in very low 
numbers. Especially if the site is visited only once, it is easy to miss
 an observation if individuals are quite rare.</p>

          <p id="p-131" data-page="59443">On Saipan, several areas were 
found that supported host plants in 2011 and 2012; however, no 
individuals of the Mariana eight-spot butterfly were seen, and it may be
 extirpated on Saipan (Schreiner and Nafus 1997, p. 26; Harrington <em>et al.</em>
 2012, in litt., p. 19; Rubinoff 2014, in litt.). It is possible that 
small undetected populations of the Mariana eight-spot butterfly still 
occur on islands previously recorded (Lindstrom and Benedict 2014, p. 
34), or even on the more isolated northern islands on which it has not 
previously been recorded (Rubinoff 2014, in litt.); however, without any
 evidence, this remains postulation.</p>
          <p id="p-132" data-page="59443">In summary, the Mariana 
eight-spot butterfly is now found in only six populations on the island 
of Guam. This butterfly is dependent upon two relatively rare host plant
 species, both of which are susceptible to the effects of ungulate 
grazing. The Mariana eight-spot butterfly is vulnerable to the impacts 
of continued habitat loss and destruction from agriculture, urban 
development, nonnative animals and plants, and typhoons. We anticipate 
the effects of climate change will further exacerbate many of these 
threats in the future. Herbivory of its host plants by nonnative 
animals, combined with direct predation by ants and parasitic wasps, 
contribute to the decline of the Mariana eight-spot butterfly.</p>
          <h4 id="h-32">Mariana Wandering Butterfly</h4>
          <p id="p-133" data-page="59443">The Mariana wandering butterfly (<em>Vagrans egistina</em>)
 (abbabang, libweibwogh) is endemic to the islands of Guam and Rota in 
the Mariana archipelago, in the forest ecosystem. This butterfly was 
originally named <em>Issoria egistina</em> (Swezey 1942, p. 35). In 1934, Hemming published the genus <em>Vagrans</em> as a replacement name for the genus <em>Issoria.</em> Schreiner and Nafus (1997) recognize this species as <em>Vagrans egistina,</em> which is the most recent and accepted taxonomy.</p>
          <p id="p-134" data-page="59443">Like most nymphalid 
butterflies, the Mariana wandering butterfly is primarily orange and 
black in coloration. This species is largely black in appearance with a 
prominent orange irregular pattern extending from the forewings to the 
hindwings. Obvious stripes or rows of spots are lacking (Schreiner and 
Nafus 1997, plate 9). The caterpillar larva life stage of this species 
is brown in color with black-colored spikes (Schreiner and Nafus 1996, 
p. 10).</p>

          <p id="p-135" data-page="59443">Mariana wandering butterflies 
are known to be good fliers, and in earlier times, probably existed as a
 series of meta-populations (Harrison <em>et al.</em> 1988, p. 360), 
with considerable movement and interbreeding between local and stable 
populations and continued colonization and extinction in disparate 
localities. The larvae of this butterfly feed on the plant species <em>Maytenus thompsonii</em>
 (luluhut) in the Celastraceae family, which is endemic to the Mariana 
Islands (Swezey 1942, p. 35; Schreiner and Nafus 1996, p. 1). The host 
plant <em>M. thompsonii</em> is known to occur within the forest ecosystem on Guam, Rota, Saipan, and Tinian (Vogt and Williams 2004, p. 121).</p>

          <p id="p-136" data-page="59443">Historically, the Mariana 
wandering butterfly was originally collected and described from the 
island of Guam where it was considered to be rare, but widespread 
(Swezey 1942, p. 35). The species has not been observed on Guam since 
1979, where it was last collected in Agana. Currently, it is considered 
likely extirpated from Guam (Schreiner and Nafus 1996, pp. 1-2; Rubinoff
 2013, in litt.). The Mariana wandering butterfly was first collected on
 Rota in the 1980s (Schreiner and Nafus 1996, p. 10). During several 
1995 surveys on Rota, it was recorded at only one location among six 
different sites surveyed (Schreiner and Nafus 1996, pp. 1-2). From June 
through October 2008, extensive surveys for the Mariana wandering 
butterfly were conducted on the island of Tinian under the direction of 
the Service. While several <em>Maytenus thompsonii</em> host plant 
population sites were identified in limestone forest habitat, no life 
stages of the Mariana wandering butterfly were observed (Hawley in 
litt., 2008, pp. 1-9). Despite extensive surveys on Guam in 2013 for the
 Mariana wandering butterfly and several other candidate species, no 
evidence (<em>i.e.,</em> egg, larva, or adult) of the Mariana wandering butterfly was found (Lindstrom and Benedict 2014, pp. 21-41).</p>
          <p id="p-137" data-page="59443">Although considered extirpated
 from Guam, whether the Mariana wandering butterfly continues to exist 
on Rota is unknown, since the island has not been surveyed specifically 
for this butterfly since 1995. It is possible this species occurs on the
 northern islands where host plants are found (Rubinoff 2014, in litt.),
 although there is no record of its presence. Several years of seasonal 
surveys are needed to determine the status of this species, but if it 
persists, it is likely in very low numbers as it has not been observed 
in many years. Any remaining populations of the Mariana wandering 
butterfly continue to be at risk from ongoing habitat loss and 
destruction by rats and typhoons. We anticipate the effects of climate 
change will further exacerbate many of these threats in the future. 
Herbivory of its host plant by nonnative animals, combined with direct 
predation by ants and parasitic wasps, contribute to the decline of the 
Mariana wandering butterfly.</p>

          <p id="p-138" data-page="59443">The Rota blue damselfly (<em>Ischnura luta</em>)
 (dulalas Luta, dulalas Luuta) is a small damselfly endemic to the 
island of Rota and found within the stream ecosystem. Grouped together 
with dragonflies in the order Odonata, damselflies fall within the 
suborder <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59444"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59444" data-page="59444" data-text="Start Printed Page 59444" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59444}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59444</span></span></span>Zygoptera.
 The Rota blue damselfly belongs to the family Coenagrionidae, and it is
 the only known damselfly species endemic to the Mariana Islands. This 
species was first described in 2000 (Polhemus <em>et al.</em> 2000, pp. 
1-2) based upon specimens collected in 1996. The species is relatively 
small in size, with males measuring 1.3 in (34 mm) in body length, with 
forewings and hindwings 0.7 in (18 mm) and 0.67 in (17 mm) in length, 
respectively. Both sexes are predominantly blue in color, particularly 
the thorax and portions of the male's abdomen are brilliant, iridescent 
blue. Both sexes have a yellow and black head with some yellow 
coloration on the abdomen. Females of this species may be distinguished 
by their slightly smaller size and somewhat paler blue body color 
(Polhemus <em>et al.</em> 2000, pp. 1-8).</p>
          <p id="p-139" data-page="59444">Resembling slender 
dragonflies, damselflies are readily distinguished by their trait of 
folding their wings parallel to the body while at rest rather than 
holding them out perpendicular to the body. The general biology of 
narrow-winged damselflies includes territorial males that guard areas of
 habitat where females will lay eggs (Moore 1983a, p. 89; Polhemus and 
Asquith 1996, pp. 2-7). During copulation, and often while the female 
lays eggs, the male grasps the female behind the head with terminal 
abdominal appendages to guard the female against rival males; thus males
 and females are frequently seen flying in tandem. Adult damselflies are
 predaceous and feed on small flying insects such as midges and other 
flies.</p>

          <p id="p-140" data-page="59444">The immature larval life 
stages (naiads) of the vast majority of damselfly species are aquatic, 
breathe through flattened abdominal gills, and are predaceous, feeding 
on small aquatic invertebrates or fish (Williams 1936, p. 303). Females 
lay eggs in submerged aquatic vegetation or in mats of moss or algae on 
submerged rocks, and hatching occurs in about 10 days (Williams 1936, 
pp. 303, 306, 318; Evenhuis <em>et al.</em> 1995, p. 18). Naiads may 
take up to 4 months to mature (Williams 1936, p. 309), after which they 
crawl out of the water onto rocks or vegetation to molt into winged 
adults, typically remaining close to the aquatic habitat from which they
 emerged. Adults have been observed in association only with the single 
perennial stream on Rota; therefore, we believe the larval stage of the 
Rota blue damselfly is aquatic.</p>

          <p id="p-141" data-page="59444">The Rota blue damselfly was 
first discovered in April 1996, when a few individuals were observed and
 one male and one female specimen were collected outside the Talakhaya 
Water Cave (also known as Sonson Water Cave) located below the Sabana 
plateau (Camacho <em>et al.</em> 1997, p. 4; Polhemus <em>et al.</em> 
2000, pp. 1-8). The size of the population at the time of discovery was 
estimated to be small and limited to the stream area near the mouth of 
the cave. The primary source of the stream is spring water emerging at 
the limestone-basalt interface below the highly permeable limestone of 
the Sabana plateau (Polhemus <em>et al.</em> 2000, pp. 1-8; Keel <em>et al.</em> 2011, p. 1). This spring also serves as the main source of fresh water supply for the population of Rota (Polhemus <em>et al.</em> 2000, pp. 1-8; Keel <em>et al.</em>
 2011, p. 1). A concrete collection structure with associated piping has
 been built into and surrounding the entrance of the water cave. This 
catchment system and a smaller, adjacent catchment deliver approximately
 2.7 to 3.8 million liters-per-day (0.7 to 1 million gallons) of water 
to Rota's municipal system (Keel <em>et al.</em> 2011, pp. 29-30) (see “Stream Ecosystem,” in the proposed rule (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/79-FR-59364">79 FR 59364</a>; October 1, 2014), and Water Extraction under <em>Factor E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Their Continued Existence,</em> below, for further discussion).</p>

          <p id="p-142" data-page="59444">Eighteen years elapsed between
 the original discovery of the species in 1996 and the next known survey
 for the Rota blue damselfly. In January 2014, two male specimens were 
observed flying above a portion of the stream located at approximately 
770 ft (235 m) in elevation, and below the Talakhaya (Sonson) Water Cave
 (Richardson 2014, in litt.). No specimens were observed immediately in 
the vicinity of the water cave entrance, and no fish were observed in 
the stream immediately below the cave entrance (Richardson 2014, in 
litt.). This is a notable observation because many damselfly species 
endemic to Pacific islands are known to be susceptible to predation by 
nonnative fish species that eat the naiad life stage of the damselfly. 
In November 2015, Zarones <em>et al.</em> (2015b, in litt.) conducted a 
survey on Rota looking for the Rota blue damselfly and found one 
individual along a stream 744 yards (680 m) to the west of Water Cave 
area, not connected to the stream at the Water Cave. Zarones <em>et al.</em> (2015b, in litt.) did not report whether or not any native or nonnative fish were observed in the stream.</p>

          <p id="p-143" data-page="59444">Predation by nonnative fish is a serious threat to the Hawaiian <em>Megalagrion</em>
 damselfly naiads (Englund 1999, pp. 235-236). Eggs laid in vegetation 
or on rocks in streams hatch in about 10 days and develop into naiads. 
Naiads take approximately 4 months to mature before emerging from the 
water (Williams 1936, pp. 303, 306, 309, 318). Fish predation has been 
an important factor in the evolution of behavior in damselfly naiads in 
continental systems (Johnson 1991, p. 8), and damselflies in the 
wider-ranging <em>Ishnura</em> (as opposed to the Hawaiian <em>Megalagrion</em>)
 may have developed avoidance behaviors (Polhemus 2014, pers. comm.). On
 a survey of the stream (Okgok River, also known as Babao) fed by the 
Talakhaya (Sonson) Water Cave, the presence of four native fish species 
was noted: The eel <em>Anguilla marmorata,</em> the mountain gobies <em>Stiphodon elegans</em> and <em>Sicyopus leprurus,</em> and the flagtail, or mountain bass, <em>Kuhlia rupestris</em> (Camacho <em>et al.</em>
 1997, p. 8). Densities of these native fish were low, especially in 
areas above the waterfall. Gobies can maneuver in areas of rapidly 
flowing water by using ventral fins that are modified to form a sucking 
disk (Ego 1956, in litt.). The flagtails were abundant only in the lower
 reach of the stream. Freshwater gobies in Hawaii are primarily browsers
 and bottom feeders, often eating algae off rocks and boulders, with 
midges and worms being their primary food items (Ego 1956, in litt.; 
Kido <em>et al.</em> 1993, p. 47). It can only be speculated that the 
Rota blue damselfly may have adapted its behavior to avoid the benthic 
feeding habits of native fish species. The release of aquarium fish into
 streams and rivers of Guam is well documented, but currently, no 
nonnative fish have been found in the Rota stream (Tibbatts 2014, in 
litt.).</p>

          <p id="p-144" data-page="59444">The Rota blue damselfly 
appears to be extremely limited in range and researchers remain 
perplexed by its absence from other Mariana Islands (Polhemus <em>et al.</em>
 2000, p. 8). Particularly striking is the fact that it has never been 
collected on Guam, despite the islands' larger size and presence of over
 100 rivers and streams. The Rota blue damselfly's population site 
(Talakhaya watershed area) is afforded some protection from human impact
 by its remote and relatively inaccessible location; however, a 
reduction or removal of stream flow due to increased interception for 
municipal usage, and from lower water quantities resulting from the 
effects of future climate change, could eliminate one of the only two 
known populations of the species (see “Stream Ecosystem,” in the 
proposed rule (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/79-FR-59364">79 FR 59364</a>; October 1, 2014), and Water Extraction under <em>Factor E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Their Continued Existence,</em>
 below, for further discussion). Introduction of nonnative fish into the
 stream could also impact or eliminate the Rota blue damselfly <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59445"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59445" data-page="59445" data-text="Start Printed Page 59445" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59445}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59445</span></span></span>naiads,
 leading to its extirpation. In addition, low numbers of individuals 
results in loss of vigor and genetic representation, and contributes to 
the vulnerability of the single known population of the Rota blue 
damselfly.</p>
          <h4 id="h-34">Humped Tree Snail</h4>
          <p id="p-145" data-page="59445">The humped tree snail (<em>Partula gibba;</em>
 akaleha, denden), in the Partulidae family, is endemic to the forest 
ecosystem on the Mariana Islands of Guam, Rota, Saipan, Tinian, 
Aguiguan, Anatahan, Sarigan, Alamagan, and Pagan. The humped tree snail 
was first collected on Guam in 1819 by Quoy and Gaimard during the 
Freycinet Uranie expedition of 1817-1819 and was once considered the 
most abundant tree snail on Guam (Crampton 1925, pp. 8, 25, 60). 
Currently, the humped tree snail is known from the islands of Guam, 
(Hopper and Smith 1992, p. 81; Smith <em>et al.</em> 2009, pp. 10, 12, 
16), Rota (Smith 1995, p. 1; Bauman 1996, pp. 15, 18), Saipan (Hadfield 
2010, pp. 20-21), Tinian (NavFac, Pacific 2014, pp. 5-5—5-7), Sarigan 
(Hadfield 2010, p. 21), Alamagan (Bourquin 2002, p. 30), and Pagan 
(Hadfield 2010, pp. 8-14), in the forest ecosystem. The humped tree 
snail may occur on Aguiguan, but was not relocated on a survey by Smith 
in 2006 (Smith 2013, p. 14). This species is no longer extant on 
Anatahan due to volcanic activity in 2003 and 2005 (Kessler 2011, pp. 
321, 323).</p>

          <p id="p-146" data-page="59445">The shell of the humped tree 
snail can be left- or right-coiling, conic-ovate, translucent, with 
evenly spaced spiral sculpturing (Cowie 2014, in litt.). The color 
ranges from white to brown, and a pointed apex is colored rose-red, with
 a milky white suture. Adult snails are from 0.6 to 0.7 in (14 to 18 mm)
 long, and 0.4 to 0.6 in (10 to 14 mm) wide, with 4.5 whorls, the last 
of which is the largest (Pilsbry 1909-1910, in Crampton 1925, p. 60; 
Smith <em>et al.</em> 2009, p. 2). In general, partulid snails may live 
up to 5 years. They reproduce in less than 1 year, at which time they 
can produce up to 18 young each year. Partulids are ovoviviparous (give 
birth to live young), more mobile during higher ambient humidity and 
precipitation and less mobile during dry periods, live on bushes or 
trees, and feed primarily on dead or decaying plant material (Cowie 
1992, p. 167; Hopper 2014, in litt.).</p>

          <p id="p-147" data-page="59445">The humped tree snail occurs 
in cool, shaded forest habitat as first observed by Crampton (Crampton 
1925, pp. 31, 61), with high humidity and reduced air movement that 
prevents excessive water loss. Crampton (1925, pp. 31, 61) described the
 habitat requirements of the partulid tree snails as having 
“sufficiently high and dense growth to provide shade, to conserve 
moisture, and to effect the production of a rich humus. Hence the limits
 to the areas occupied by tree snails are set by the more ultimate 
ecological conditions which determine the distribution of suitable 
vegetation.” Crampton further notes that the Mariana Islands partulid 
tree snails live on subcanopy vegetation and are not found in high 
canopy. Although tree snails in the Mariana Islands likely evolved to 
live upon native vegetation, there is no clear indication of obligate 
relationships with any particular type of tree or plant (Fiedler 2014, 
in litt.). Further, Mariana partulid snail species are observed to use 
nonnative “home plants” to which they have apparently adapted (Fiedler 
2014, in litt.). Although it has been suggested that native crabs may 
prey on Mariana partulid snails (Fiedler 2014, in litt.), they are not 
regarded as a major threat to these tree snails compared to alien 
carnivorous flatworms (<em>i.e.,</em> the manokwari flatworm) and snails (<em>i.e.,</em> the rosy wolf snail <em>Euglandina rosea</em> and <em>Gonaxis</em>
 spp.) (Cowie 1992, p. 175). Nonnative mites and ants have also raised 
some concerns about their impacts on Mariana partulid snails (Fiedler 
2014, in litt.); however, these are only potential threats at this time.</p>

          <p id="p-148" data-page="59445">Following is a brief 
historical overview of the humped tree snail in the Mariana archipelago.
 Crampton (1925, pp. 8, 25, 60) first observed the humped tree snail on 
Guam, in at least 39 sites, totaling more than 3,000 individuals. In 
1989, Hopper and Smith (1992, p. 81) resurveyed 34 of Crampton's 39 
sites and did not locate any live individuals; however, they discovered 
individuals at a new site not noted by Crampton. In 2009, the number of 
individuals of the humped tree snail on Guam was thought to have 
declined from hundreds to fewer than 50 individuals (Smith <em>et al.</em>
 2009, p. 11); however, in 2014, a previously undocumented population 
consisting of approximately 100 individuals was discovered (Fiedler 
2014, in litt.; Myounghee Noh and Associates 2014, pp. 1-28, and 
Appendices A and B), which brings the total number of confirmed 
individuals on Guam to fewer than 150.</p>
          <p id="p-149" data-page="59445">Bauman (1996, pp. 15, 18) 
surveyed Rota and reported finding live humped tree snails at 5 out of 
25 former sites. The largest of these populations may have totaled as 
many as 1,000 snails. However, this population was located along the 
main road of Rota and was subsequently cleared for development (Miller 
2007, pers. comm.), thus we conclude this population is no longer extant
 since its suitable habitat at this site was removed. Four other 
populations on Rota in 2007 were small and totaled fewer than 600 
individuals, collectively. Crampton was unable to visit Tinian, although
 he states that tree snails were known from that island (Crampton 1925, 
p. 6). Smith reported finding only very old shells on two surveys (2006 
and 2008) of Tinian (Smith 2013, p. 6). The humped tree snail was 
thought to be extirpated from Tinian, until a recent survey located a 
single colony in a very isolated spot on the island (NavFac 2014, pp. 
5-5—5-7).</p>
          <p id="p-150" data-page="59445">The humped tree snail was 
discovered on Aguiguan in 1952, in six colonies (biologists often refer 
to snail populations as “colonies”) (Kondo 1970, pp. 75, 81). In 1992, 
two separate surveys reported snails observed at four locations on 
Aguiguan (Craig and Chandran 1992, p. 8; Smith 1995, pp. 13-14), but by 
2008, no live snails were found on this island (Smith 2013, p. 14). On 
Saipan, Crampton collected almost 7,000 humped tree snails in 1925 
(Crampton 1925, p. 62). By 1991, Smith and Hopper (1994, p. 11) could 
not find any live snails at 12 sites visited on the island; however, 2 
small populations were later discovered, one in 2002, in the central 
forest area, and another in a mangrove wetland in 2010 (Bourquin 2002, 
in litt.; Hadfield 2010, pp. 20-21).</p>

          <p id="p-151" data-page="59445">In 1994, Kurozumi reported 
approximately 20 individuals from Anatahan; however, these were possibly
 extirpated due to violently destructive volcanic eruptions between 2003
 and 2005 (Kessler 2011, p. 321). Kurozumi also reported humped tree 
snails from Sarigan in 1994, and the population appears to be increasing
 as a result of the removal of ungulates. A survey of Sarigan in 2006 
found the healthiest population in native forest at an elevation of 
approximately 1,300 ft (400 m) (Smith 2006 in Martin <em>et al.</em> 
2008, p. 8-1). The species was first reported on Alamagan by Kondo in 
1949, with over 50 individuals collected from wet forest (Easley 1970, 
p. 87). The populations have declined on Alamagan by more than 70 
percent for individuals and approximately 27 percent for populations 
since that time (Kurozumi 1994, pp. 115-116). The humped tree snail was 
first reported from Pagan by Kondo in 1949 (Easley 1970, p. 87). 
Populations persist on Pagan, although declines similar to those on 
Alamagan have been observed (Kurozumi 1994, pp. 115-116).</p>

          <p id="p-152" data-page="59445">In summary, populations of the
 humped tree snail are rapidly decreasing from initial numbers observed,
 and with continued habitat loss and predation by nonnative species, are
 at risk. The effects of future climate change are likely to have 
negative <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59446"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59446" data-page="59446" data-text="Start Printed Page 59446" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59446}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59446</span></span></span>impacts
 on the habitat of the humped tree snail, and further exacerbate other 
threats to the species, such as threats from typhoons to small, isolated
 populations. The populations on Sarigan may be relatively more stable 
due to the removal of ungulates (see “Conservation Efforts to Reduce 
Habitat Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Range,” below),
 but predation by rats remains a threat on that island (Kessler 2011, p.
 320), as does the potential introduction of other harmful nonnative 
species (Hopper 2014, in litt.). Collecting of snail shells for trade 
may also contribute to the decline of the humped tree snail (USFWS 2012,
 in litt.).</p>

          <p id="p-153" data-page="59446">Preliminary new data, soon to 
be published but still under review, suggest that the individuals 
identified as humped tree snails on Rota may be a different species 
(Hadfield 2010, pp. 20-21; Sischo and Hadfield 2015, under review). The 
species description for this newly identified partulid on Rota, 
tentatively named <em>Partula lutaensis,</em> will be published in a 
separate paper currently being drafted (Sischo 2015, in litt.). However,
 we must make our determination based on the best scientific data 
available, and at this point in time the humped tree snail is recognized
 as a single species. Our determination is that the humped tree snail, 
as currently described, warrants listing as an endangered species. If 
taxonomic changes are made in the future, we may reevaluate the status 
of any newly recognized species or subspecies at that point in time.</p>
          <h4 id="h-35">Langford's Tree Snail</h4>
          <p id="p-154" data-page="59446">Langford's tree snail (<em>Partula langfordi;</em>
 akaleha, denden), in the Partulidae family, is endemic to the forest 
ecosystem of the island of Aguiguan. Langford's tree snail was first 
collected and described by Kondo while working on biological control 
agents in the early 1950s (Kondo 1970, 18 pp.). Kondo's taxonomic work 
is the most recent and accepted taxonomy for this species. This tree 
snail has not been observed in the wild since 1992, when one live 
individual was observed on the northwest terrace of the island (Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005, p. 154). Surveys conducted in 2006 and 2008 revealed only old shells of dead <em>P. langfordi</em> (Smith 2013, p. 14).</p>
          <p id="p-155" data-page="59446">Langford's tree snail has a 
dextral (to the right or clockwise from the opening of the shell at the 
lower right, as opposed to sinistral, to the left, or counterclockwise) 
shell, described by Kondo (1970, pp. 75-77) as being ovate-conic and 
moderately thin. The holotype of this species has a length of 0.6 in (14
 mm), a diameter of 0.4 in (9 mm), and an aperture length of 0.3 in (8 
mm). It has a spire of five whorls that are slightly convex, with an 
obtuse apex. Its aperture is oblong-ovate with the white mouth 
projections thickened and expanded. It is buff colored superimposed by 
maroon.</p>

          <p id="p-156" data-page="59446">Although much less studied 
than related partulid snails from the Mariana Islands, the biology of 
Langford's tree snail is believed to be the same. See “Humped tree snail
 (<em>Partula gibba</em>),” above, for details.</p>
          <p id="p-157" data-page="59446">Historically, Langford's tree 
snail is known only from the island of Aguiguan. In the 1970 survey of 
Aguiguan, it was noted that Langford's tree snail was collected from an 
area where it occurred sympatrically with the humped tree snail (Easely 
1970, p. 89). The mixed populations were not uniformly distributed, but 
occurred in small colonies with large unoccupied areas between the 
colonies. In five of the sites, the Langford's tree snail outnumbered 
the humped tree snail, and it appeared that humped tree snails were more
 numerous and dominant in the western portion of the site while 
Langford's tree snails were dominant in the eastern portion of the site 
(Kondo 1970, p. 81). Three other colonies of Langford's tree snail were 
collected, two on the north coast and one on the west end of Aguiguan 
(Kondo 1970, p. 81). A total of 464 adults were collected from 7 sites 
(Kondo 1970, p. 81). In 1985, five adult Langford's tree snails were 
collected from the west end of the island (Smith 1995). The last survey 
in which the species was detected in the wild was conducted in 1992, and
 one live snail was observed on the northwest terrace of the island 
(Smith 1995). Surveys of Aguiguan in 2006 and 2008 failed to locate any 
live Langford's tree snails (Smith 2013, p. 14).</p>

          <p id="p-158" data-page="59446">In 1993, the University of 
Nottingham in England had six young and four adult Langford's tree 
snails in captivity. By 1994, two adult snails remained. Unfortunately, 
at the end of 1994, the last two Langford's tree snails died 
(Pearce-Kelly <em>et al.</em> 1995, pp. 647-660).</p>

          <p id="p-159" data-page="59446">The 2005 Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy for CNMI (Division of Fish and Wildlife) (Berger <em>et al.</em>
 2005) states that “all partulid snails are selected as a species of 
special conservation need” (p. 153), and that “[Crampton] found as many 
as 31 snails on the underside of a single leaf of caladium” (p. 155) 
(demonstrating that it would be easy to miss a large number of snails if
 that one particular leaf were missed during a survey). This strategy 
outlines conservation actions for Langford's tree snail, including more 
numerous and intensive surveys, removal of goats from Aguiguan island, 
control of nonnative species, and reforestation with native plants 
(Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005, pp. 158-159). Given that so few surveys 
have been conducted on Aguiguan, and only previously surveyed sites were
 ever revisited, it is possible Langford's tree snail may be found.</p>

          <p id="p-160" data-page="59446">In summary, Langford's tree snail is at risk from threats associated with small numbers of individuals and populations (<em>e.g.,</em>
 population declines through loss of vigor and genetic representation), 
habitat loss and degradation by nonnative animals (goats and rats) and 
development, and predation by nonnative animals (rats and flatworms). 
Due to the small number of individuals and populations, natural events 
such as typhoons also pose a threat, as a single catastrophic event 
could potentially result in the extinction of the species. Further, the 
collection of snail shells for trade may also contribute to the decline 
of the humped tree snail (USFWS 2012, in litt.). Although not all of the
 negative impacts that will result from climate change can be predicted,
 the cumulative data suggest that climate change will impact Langford's 
tree snails, likely by means of alteration of habitat to less favorable 
conditions.</p>
          <h4 id="h-36">Guam Tree Snail</h4>
          <p id="p-161" data-page="59446">The Guam tree snail (<em>Partula radiolata;</em>
 akaleha, denden), in the Partulidae family, is endemic to the forest 
ecosystem of Guam; this species is not found on any other island. The 
Guam tree snail was first collected by Quoy and Gaimard during the 
French <em>Astrolabe</em> expedition of 1828 and was initially named <em>Bulimus</em> (<em>Partula</em>) <em>radiolatus</em> by Pfeiffer in 1846, which he changed to <em>Partula radiolata</em> in 1849 (Crampton 1925, p. 34). Crampton's 1925 taxonomic work is the most recent and accepted taxonomy for this species.</p>

          <p id="p-162" data-page="59446">The shell of the Guam tree 
snail is pale straw-colored with darker streaks and brown lines, and has
 impressed spiral lines. Adult length is 0.5 to 0.7 in (13 to 18.5 mm), 
width is 0.3 to 0.5 in (8 to 12 mm), with five slightly convex whorls 
(Pilsbry 1909-1910 in Crampton 1925, p. 35; Smith <em>et al.</em> 2008 in Kerr 2013, p. 10). Juvenile Guam tree snails are sometimes mistakenly identified as <em>Samoana fragilis</em>
 (Fielder 2014, in litt.). The biology of the Guam tree snail is very 
similar to that of the humped tree snail (see “Humped tree snail (<em>Partula gibba</em>),”
 above, for further description). The Guam tree snail prefers the same 
cool, shaded forest habitat as the humped tree snail and Langford's tree
 snail, described above.</p>

          <p id="p-163" data-page="59446">Historically, suitable habitat for the Guam tree snail was widely available <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59447"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59447" data-page="59447" data-text="Start Printed Page 59447" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59447}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59447</span></span></span>prior
 to World War II, and included strand vegetation, forested river 
borders, and lowland and highland forests; as Crampton (1925, pp. 36-37)
 described, “it occurs almost everywhere on the island where suitable 
vegetation exists,” although historical population numbers are unknown. 
Crampton (1925, pp. 38-40) found the Guam tree snail at 37 of 39 sites 
surveyed on Guam and collected a total of 2,278 individuals. The actual 
population sizes were probably considerably larger since the purpose of 
Crampton's collections was to evaluate geographic differences in shell 
patterns and not to assess population size. In 1989, Hopper and Smith 
(1992, p. 78) resurveyed 34 of Crampton's 39 sites on Guam and an 
additional 13 new sites. They observed that 9 of the original 34 sites 
resurveyed supported these snails; however, the Crampton site identified
 as having the largest remaining population of the Guam tree snail 
(estimated at greater than 500 snails) had been completely eliminated by
 the combined effects of land clearing for a residential development and
 a subsequent series of typhoons in 1990, 1991, and 1992 (Smith 1995, 
pp. 6-11).</p>
          <p id="p-164" data-page="59447">Of the 13 new sites surveyed 
by Hopper and Smith in 1989, 7 supported populations of the Guam tree 
snail. One of these populations was eliminated by wildfires that burned 
into ravine forest occupied by the snails in 1991 and 1992 (Smith and 
Hopper 1994, pp. 10-11). Further surveys by Smith (1995, pp. 1-25) 
revealed five new populations of the Guam tree snail. According to 
Smith, by 1995, there were 20 sites that still supported small 
populations of the Guam tree snail. Snails were moved from 1 of these 20
 sites to a new location due to the development of a golf course (Smith 
1995, pp. 6-11). In 2003 an additional small colony (fewer than 100 
snails) was found on the U.S. Naval Base (Smith 2006, pers. comm.). A 
smaller colony (20 to 25 snails) was found in 2004 along the Lonfit 
River (Smith 2006, pers. comm.). Additionally, surveys on the Guam Naval
 Magazine located another new population, with shells of tree snails in 
abundance on the ground at all locations (Miller 2006, pers. comm.; 
JGPO-NavFac 2014 apps, pp. 27, 59).</p>

          <p id="p-165" data-page="59447">Further surveys of lands 
leased by the Navy in 2009 indicated a decline in densities of tree 
snails by about half, which was attributed to a loss of native 
understory (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2009, pp. 13-14). In 2011, a survey of
 Andersen AFB revealed a single colony of Guam tree snail (Joint 
Regional Marianas Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan 
Appendices 2012, p. 15). In 2013, a survey team on Guam observed small 
colonies of the Guam tree snail (ranging from 10 to 150 individuals per 
colony) at approximately 20 sites around the island (Lindstrom and 
Benedict 2014, p. 27). A 2014 study conducted solely at the Haputo 
Ecological Reserve Area (HERA) and adjacent forested areas counted 
almost 1,500 live Guam tree snails (Myounghee Noh and Associates 2014, 
pp. 1-28, and Appendices A and B); however, there are nonnative 
ungulates (pigs and deer) and the manokwari flatworm in the area 
(Lindstrom and Benedict 2014, pp. 32-33; Myounghee Noh and Associates 
2014, p. B-8), all of which pose threats to the Guam tree snail. Some 
snail experts who frequently conduct fieldwork in the Mariana Islands 
have reported there are at least 26 populations of the Guam tree snail; 
however, they also note that habitat destruction and the manokwari 
flatworm still pose significant threats to this species, which is 
particularly vulnerable as a single-island endemic (Fiedler 2014, in 
litt.).</p>

          <p id="p-166" data-page="59447">Lindstrom and Benedict (2014, 
p. 27) conducted a genetic analysis using snail slime collected at 20 
sites around Guam. The results from this genetic analysis showed the 
Guam tree snail has a very low degree of genetic diversity between all 
the surveyed populations, which makes this species vulnerable to 
extinction pressures associated with low numbers of individuals and 
populations (<em>e.g.,</em> disease). Additionally, despite being the 
most widespread partulid on Guam, Lindstrom and Benedict's data (2014, 
pp. 27, 31, 32) show that Guam tree snails are still disappearing 
compared to historical abundance (Lindstrom and Benedict 2014, p. 32).</p>
          <p id="p-167" data-page="59447">Overall, populations of the 
Guam tree snail continue to decline, from first observations of at least
 37 populations as observed by Crampton, down to 26 colonies or fewer 
today. Continued loss of habitat due to development and removal of 
native plants by ungulates contribute to this loss, trade of shells by 
collectors may be a threat, and predation by the invasive manokwari 
flatworm is likely a significant source of mortality (see Summary of 
Biological Status and Threats Affecting the 23 Mariana Islands Species, 
below). We anticipate the effects of climate change will further 
exacerbate many of these threats in the future.</p>
          <h4 id="h-37">Fragile Tree Snail</h4>
          <p id="p-168" data-page="59447">The fragile tree snail (<em>Samoana fragilis;</em>
 akaleha dogas, denden), in the Partulidae family, is known from the 
forest ecosystems of Guam and Rota. This species was first described as <em>Partula fragilis</em> by Férussac in 1821 (Crampton 1925, p. 30). It is the only species representing the genus of <em>Samoana</em>
 in the Mariana Islands. The fragile tree snail was first collected on 
Guam in 1819 by Quoy and Gaimard during the Freycinet Uranie expedition 
of 1817 to 1819 (Crampton 1925, p. 30). Crampton's 1925 taxonomic work 
for this species is the most recent and accepted taxonomy for this 
species.</p>

          <p id="p-169" data-page="59447">The conical shell of the 
fragile tree snail is 0.5 to 0.6 in (12 to 16 mm) long, 0.4 to 0.5 in 
(10 to 12 mm) wide, and is formed by four whorls that spiral to the 
right. The common name is derived from the thin, semi-transparent nature
 of the shell. The shell has delicate spiral striations intersected by 
transverse growth striations. The background color is buff, tinted by 
narrow darker marks and whitish banding that are derived from the 
internal organs of the animal that are visible through the shell 
(Mollendorff 1894 in Crampton 1925, p. 31). Sometimes the Guam tree 
snail and fragile tree snail are difficult to distinguish from one 
another and DNA comparison is necessary to determine the identity 
(Fiedler 2014, in litt.). The biology and habitat for this partulid tree
 snail are the same as those described for the three partulid species 
described above (see the “Humped tree snail (<em>Partula gibba</em>),” above).</p>

          <p id="p-170" data-page="59447">Historically, the fragile tree
 snail was known from 13 populations on Guam and 1 population on Rota 
(Crampton 1925, p. 30; Kondo 1970, pp. 86-87). Easely (1970, p. 86) 
documented the 1959 discovery of the fragile tree snail on Rota by R.P. 
Owen. The same area had been surveyed just 7 years earlier by Benavente 
and Kondo, in 1952, but the fragile tree snail was not observed (Easley 
1970, p. 87). In 1989, Hopper and Smith (1992, p. 78) resurveyed 
Crampton's original sites plus 13 more, all on Guam. At that time, they 
found fragile tree snails at only six sites. The most recent surveys on 
Guam for the fragile tree snail were conducted in 2008, 2011, 2013, and 
2014. Currently, two colonies are known on Guam (Smith <em>et al.,</em> 
2009, pp. 7, 13; Myounghee Noh and Associates 2014, pp. 1-28, and 
Appendices A and B; Lindstrom and Benedict 2014, pp. 1-44, and 
Appendices A-E). Lindstrom and Benedict (2014, p. 30) found no genetic 
heterogeneity between the two populations on Guam, indicative of a small
 population that has undergone a population bottleneck, which makes this
 species less resilient evolutionarily and more vulnerable to extinction
 pressures. The original site where this species was found on Rota was 
converted to agricultural fields, and no <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59448"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59448" data-page="59448" data-text="Start Printed Page 59448" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59448}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59448</span></span></span>living
 snails were found there in 1995; however, in 1996, a new colony was 
found on Rota in a different location (Bauman 1996, pp. 18, 21).</p>
          <p id="p-171" data-page="59448">We lack quantitative estimates
 of population sizes for the fragile tree snail (Bauman 1996, p. 21), 
but Crampton (1925, p. 30) originally described this species as rare and
 low in numbers. Available data indicate the number of known colonies 
has declined between 1925 and the present, from approximately 14 
colonies to only 3 colonies.</p>
          <p id="p-172" data-page="59448">In summary, populations of the
 fragile tree snail are decreasing from initial numbers observed on Guam
 and Rota, and are at risk, due to continued habitat loss and 
destruction from agriculture, urban development, nonnative animals and 
plants, and typhoons. We anticipate the effects of climate change will 
further exacerbate many of these threats in the future. Trade of shells 
by collectors, combined with direct predation by rats and flatworms, 
also contribute to the decline of the fragile tree snail. Low numbers of
 individuals likely contribute to population declines through loss of 
vigor and genetic representation.</p>
          <h2 id="h-38">Summary of Biological Status and Threats Affecting the 23 Mariana Islands Species</h2>
          <p id="p-173" data-page="59448">Section 4 of the Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=16&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1533&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">16 U.S.C. 1533</a>) and its implementing regulations (<a class="cfr external" href="https://www.federalregister.gov/select-citation/2015/10/01/50-CFR-424">50 CFR part 424</a>)
 set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal Lists of 
Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants. A species may be 
determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more 
of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1) of the Act: (A) The 
present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its 
habitat or range; (B) overutilization for commercial, recreational, 
scientific, or educational purposes; (C) disease or predation; (D) the 
inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; and (E) other natural or 
manmade factors affecting its continued existence. Listing actions may 
be warranted based on any of the above threat factors, singly or in 
combination. Each of these factors is discussed below.</p>
          <p id="p-174" data-page="59448">In considering what factors 
might constitute threats to a species, we must look beyond the exposure 
of the species to a particular factor to evaluate whether the species 
may respond to that factor in a way that causes actual impacts to the 
species. If there is exposure to a factor and the species responds 
negatively, the factor may be a threat, and, during the status review, 
we attempt to determine how significant a threat it is. The threat is 
significant if it drives, or contributes to, the risk of extinction of 
the species such that the species warrants listing as an endangered or 
threatened species as these terms are defined in the Act. However, the 
identification of factors that could impact a species negatively may not
 be sufficient to warrant listing the species under the Act. The 
information must include evidence sufficient to show that these factors 
are operative threats that act on the species to the point that the 
species meets the definition of an endangered or threatened species 
under the Act.</p>

          <p id="p-175" data-page="59448">If we determine that the level
 of threat posed to a species by one or more of the five listing factors
 is such that the species meets the definition of either endangered or 
threatened under section 3 of the Act, that species may then be proposed
 for listing as an endangered or threatened species. The Act defines an 
endangered species as “in danger of extinction throughout all or a 
significant portion of its range,” and a threatened species as “likely 
to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout
 all or a significant portion of its range.” The threats to each of the 
individual 23 species listed as endangered or threatened species in this
 final rule are summarized in Table 3, and discussed in detail below. 
Since there are 15 islands in the Mariana Islands, Table 4 (below) is 
provided as a supplement to Table 3, to allow the reader to better 
understand the presence of nonnative species addressed in this final 
rule that negatively impact the 23 species on an island-by-island basis.<span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59449"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59449" data-page="59449" data-text="Start Printed Page 59449" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59449}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59449</span></span></span>

          <p id="p-176" data-page="59450">The available scientific 
research on each of the species listed as endangered or threatened 
species in this final rule is limited because of their rarity and the 
challenging logistics associated with conducting fieldwork in the 
Mariana Islands (<em>i.e.,</em> areas are typically remote, difficult to
 access and work in, and expensive to survey in a comprehensive manner).
 However, there is information available on many of the threats that act
 on Mariana Island ecosystems, and, for some ecosystems, these threats 
are well studied and understood. Each of the native species that occur 
in the Mariana Islands ecosystems suffers from exposure to these threats
 because each species that depends upon a shared ecosystem requires many
 of the same physical and biological features and the <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59451"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59451" data-page="59451" data-text="Start Printed Page 59451" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59451}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59451</span></span></span>successful
 functioning of their specific ecosystem to survive, and in some cases, 
this information is the best and only information available to assess 
threats to the species. In addition, in some cases we have identified 
species-specific threats—threats that affect only a particular species 
or subset of species within a shared ecosystem—such as predation of tree
 snails by nonnative invertebrates. The species discussed in this final 
rule, which are dependent on the native ecosystems that are affected by 
these threats, have in turn shown declines in either number of 
individuals, number of occurrences, or changes in species abundance and 
species composition. These declines can reasonably be attributed 
directly or indirectly to the threats discussed below. By indirectly, we
 mean that where there are threats to the ecosystem that negatively 
affect the ecosystem, the species in that ecosystem that depend upon it 
for survival are negatively affected as well.</p>

list of ecosystem-scale threats that affect the 23 species addressed in 
this final rule, in the four described ecosystems on the Mariana

 support native plant communities, bury or damage native plants, and 
have adverse effects on water quality due to runoff over exposed soils 
(Cuddihy and Stone 1990, p. 63; Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005, pp. 42, 44, 138, 156-157; CNMI-SWARS 2010, pp. 9-10; Kessler 2011, p. 323).</p>
          <p id="p-179" data-page="59451">(2) Ungulate destruction of 
seeds and seedlings of native plant species through foraging and 
trampling facilitates the conversion of disturbed areas from native to 
nonnative vegetative communities (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, p. 65).</p>
          <p id="p-180" data-page="59451">(3) Disturbance of soils by 
feral pigs from rooting can create fertile seedbeds for alien plants, 
some of them spread by ingestion and excretion by pigs (Cuddihy and 
Stone 1990, p. 65; Kessler 2011, pp. 320, 323).</p>
          <p id="p-181" data-page="59451">(4) Increased nutrient 
availability as a result of pigs rooting in nitrogen-poor soils, which 
facilitates establishment of alien weeds. Introduced vertebrates are 
known to enhance the germination of alien plants through seed 
scarification in digestive tracts or through rooting and fertilization 
with feces of potential seedbeds (Stone 1985, p. 253). In addition, 
alien weeds are more adapted to nutrient-rich soils than native plants 
(Cuddihy and Stone 1990, p. 65), and rooting activity creates open areas
 in forests, allowing alien species to completely replace native stands.</p>
          <p id="p-182" data-page="59451">(5) Rodent damage to plant 
propagules, seedlings, or native trees, which changes forest composition
 and structure (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, p. 67).</p>
          <p id="p-183" data-page="59451">(6) Feeding or defoliation of 
native plants by nonnative insects, which can reduce geographic ranges 
of some species, because the damage caused by these insects weakens the 
plants, making them more susceptible to disease or other predators and 
herbivores (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, p. 71).</p>
          <p id="p-184" data-page="59451">(7) Nonnative insect predation
 on native insects, which affects native plant species by preventing 
pollination and seed set and dispersal, and can directly kill native 
insects (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, p. 71).</p>
          <p id="p-185" data-page="59451">(8) Nonnative animal (rat, 
snake, and monitor lizard) predation on native birds, tree snails, bats,
 and skinks causes island extirpations or extinctions, in addition to 
altering seed dispersal of native plants (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, pp. 
72-73).</p>
          <p id="p-186" data-page="59451">(9) Future effects from 
climate change. Although we do not have specific information on the 
impacts of the effects of climate change to the 23 species, projected 
increases in ambient temperature and precipitation, as well as increased
 severity of typhoons, will likely exacerbate other threats to these 
species as well as provide additional stresses on their habitats. The 
probability of species extinction as a result of climate change impacts 
increases when its range is restricted, habitat decreases, and numbers 
of populations decline (IPCC 2007, p. 48), as is the case for the 23 
species under consideration here.</p>

          <p id="p-187" data-page="59451">Each of the above threats is 
discussed in more detail below, and summarized above in Table 3. The 
most-often cited effects of nonnative plants on native plant species are
 competition and displacement. Competition may be for water, light, or 
nutrients, or it may involve allelopathy (chemical inhibition of growth 
of other plants). Alien plants may displace native species of plants by 
preventing their reproduction, usually by shading and taking up 
available sites for seedling establishment. Alien plant invasions may 
also alter entire ecosystems by forming monotypic stands, changing fire 
characteristics of native communities, altering soil-water regimes, 
changing nutrient cycling, or encouraging other nonnative organisms 
(Vitousek <em>et al.</em> 1987, pp. 224-227; Smith 1989, p. 62).</p>

          <p id="p-188" data-page="59451">The consequences of past land 
use practices, such as agricultural or urban development, have resulted 
in little or no native vegetation remaining throughout the inhabited 
islands of the Mariana archipelago, largely impacting the forest, 
savanna, stream, and cave ecosystems (Steadman 1990, pp. 207-215; 
Steadman 1995, pp. 1,123-1,131; Fritts and Rodda 1998, pp. 119-120; 
Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund 2007, pp. i-viii, 1-127). Areas once
 used for agriculture by the Chamorro are now being converted into 
residential areas, left fallow, or are being burned by hunters to 
attract deer (GDAWR 2006, p. 30; Boland 2014, in litt.). Guam's 
projected population increase by 2040 to 230,000 is an increase of 
almost 70 percent from that in 2010 (World Population Review 2014, in 
litt.). CNMI's current population of a little more than 51,000 is a 
decrease from that in 2010, due to collapse of the local garment 
industry (Eugenio 2009, in litt.). In their 2015 Final SEIS (<em><a date="10/01/2015" href="http://guambuildupeis.us/">http://guambuildupeis.us/​</a></em>)
 (see “Historical and Ongoing Human Impacts,” above), the U.S. 
Department of Navy states that approximately 5,000 Marines will be 
relocated from Okinawa to Guam, accompanied by approximately 1,300 
dependents, with a concurrent introduction of support staff and 
development of infrastructure, and increased use of resources such as 
water (Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005, p. 347; JGPO-NavFac, Pacific 2015, p. ES-3).</p>

          <p id="p-189" data-page="59451">The military buildup on Guam 
was originally valued in excess of $10 billion (2.5 times the size of 
the current Guam economy), and was planned to take place over 4 years 
(Guam Economic Development Authority 2011, p. 58). The scope of the 
relocation of personnel has decreased since this estimate in 2011, but 
the relocation will still greatly affect infrastructure and resource 
needs (JGPO-NavFac, Pacific 2015, p. ES 3; CJMT EIS-OEIS 2015, pp. 
ES-1-ES-77; <em><a date="10/01/2015" href="http://www.cnmijointmilitarytrainingeis.com/">http://www.cnmijointmilitarytrainingeis.com/​</a></em>).
 The current preferred alternative sites on Guam for cantonment and

 guamense, Cycas micronesica, Dendrobium guamense, Eugenia bryanii, 
Heritiera longipetiolata, Maesa walkeri, Nervilia jacksoniae, Psychotria
 malaspinae, Solanum guamense, Tabernaemontana rotensis,</em> and <em>Tuberolabium guamense;</em>
 and 5 of the 9 animals: The Mariana eight-spot butterfly, the Mariana 
wandering butterfly, the Guam tree snail, the humped tree snail, and the
 fragile tree snail), and additionally includes the host plants <em>Procris pendunculata</em> and <em>Elatostema calcareum</em> for the Mariana eight-spot butterfly and the host plant <em>Maytenus thompsonii</em>
 for the Mariana wandering butterfly. Further, the Navy is planning 
jungle training at the Naval Munitions Site (NMS) on Guam, which will 
require the establishment of foot trails within the southern portion of 
the NMS due to repeat use during maneuvering training. At least 5 of the
 23 species (the plants <em>Cycas micronesica, Maesa walkeri, Psychotria malaspinae,</em> and <em>Tuberolabium guamense;</em> and the Guam tree snail) are known to occur on the Naval Magazine.</p>

          <p id="p-190" data-page="59452">The inhabited island of Tinian
 and the uninhabited island of Pagan are planned to be used for military
 training with live-fire weapons and presence of military personnel (see
 “Historical and Ongoing Human Impacts,” above). The northern two-thirds
 of Tinian are leased by the U.S. Department of Defense, and the 
development of these lands and effects from live-fire training will 
directly impact the tree <em>Heritiera longipetiolata</em> and the 
humped tree snail, and their habitat in the forest ecosystem. Pagan is 
occupied by Slevin's skink, the humped tree snail, and tentatively <em>Cycas micronesica;</em> and is historical habitat of <em>Bulbophyllum guamense,</em>
 all of which will be negatively impacted by direct destruction by 
live-fire weapons or possible wildfires caused by them and by trampling 
and destruction by military personnel.</p>

          <p id="p-191" data-page="59452">Most private lands on the 
island of Rota are on flat or low sloping ground. Low sloping grounds 
comprise approximately 66 percent of Rota's land base, and at least 75 
percent of these lands are, or will soon be, committed to private use 
(CNMI Talakhaya-Sabana Conservation Action Plan (TSCAP)-CNMI Division of
 Environmental Quality (CNMI DEQ) 2012, p. 7). CNMI government programs 
call for the transfer of portions of public lands from public to private
 ownership through agriculture or village homestead programs (TSCAP-CNMI
 DEQ 2012, p. 7). In November 2007, the people of Rota voted to legalize
 casino gambling to increase tourism, and two development projects have 
been proposed. First, the Treasure Island Casino, which will build upon 
the existing Rota Hotel (CNMI Tourism Master Plan 2012, pp. 128-129; 
Zotomayor 2014, in litt.); and second, a casino designed around the 
existing Rota Resort and Country Club. Rota currently has seven 
operational hotels, and tourism is one of the island's primary 
industries, although a lack of reliable transportation currently limits 
the amount of visitors (CNMI Tourism Master Plan 2012, pp. 128-129). The
 2012 CNMI Tourism Master Plan outlines ways to increase tourism and 
improve infrastructure on Saipan, Tinian, and Rota. Further development 
on Rota will cause an increase of water use, which will subsequently 
impact the Talakhaya Springs and the streams fed by the springs, as the 
Talakhaya Springs are the primary source of water used for human 
development on Rota. Specifically, dewatering of the streams on Rota 
could lead to elimination of the only known population of the Rota blue 
damselfly (see “Water Extraction,” below). Additionally, development 
around and within forested areas on Rota will also directly impact the 
forest habitat and individuals of <em>Bulbophyllum guamense, Cycas micronesica, Dendrobium guamense, Heritiera longipetiolata,</em>
            <em>Maesa walkeri, Nervilia jacksoniae,</em>
            <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis,</em> and <em>Tuberolabium guamense;</em> and the habitat and host plants of the Mariana wandering butterfly, and the humped tree snail and fragile tree snail.</p>

          <p id="p-192" data-page="59452">Other urban development 
(primarily involving housing development) will further impact the 
ecosystems that support native species. On Guam, a housing development 
is proposed for the Sigua highlands, where two of the plant species (<em>Hedyotis megalantha</em> and <em>Phyllanthus saffordii</em>)
 addressed in this rule are known to occur (Kelman 2013, in litt.). In 
addition, the island of Aguiguan is proposed to be developed as an 
ecotourism resort (Eugenio 2013, in litt.). If developed, this 
ecotourism resort will negatively impact the forest and cave ecosystems 
that support three of the animals (the Pacific sheath-tailed bat, the 
humped tree snail, and Langford's tree snail) listed as endangered 
species in this final rule, by causing destruction of the forest 
ecosystem (and associated food sources for the Pacific sheath-tailed 
bat) for development of tourist facilities for transportation and 
accommodation, by associated introduction of nonnative predators and 
herbivores, and by causing direct disturbance by visitation of caves.</p>
          <p id="p-193" data-page="59452">The total land area for all of the northern islands (within these species' current and historical range) is only 62 mi<sup>2</sup> (160 km<sup>2</sup>), and 44 mi<sup>2</sup> (114 km<sup>2</sup>)
 of this land area is on islands with volcanic activity, which could 
impact the species and their habitat. The larger land area on the 
southern islands (332 mi<sup>2</sup> (857 km<sup>2</sup>)), within these species' current and historical range, is undergoing increased human use, as described above.</p>

          <p id="p-194" data-page="59452">In summary, development, 
military training, urbanization (Guam DAWR 2006, p. 69), and the 
associated destruction or degradation of habitat through loss of forest 
and savanna areas, disturbance of caves, and dewatering of streams, are 
serious threats to 13 of the 14 plants (<em>Bulbophyllum guamense, Cycas
 micronesica, Dendrobium guamense, Eugenia bryanii, Hedyotis megalantha,
 Heritiera longipetiolata, Maesa walkeri, Nervilia jacksoniae, 
Phyllanthus saffordii, Psychotria malaspinae, Solanum guamense, 
Tabernaemontana rotensis,</em> and <em>Tuberolabium guamense</em>), and 
to 8 of the 9 animals (the Pacific sheath-tailed bat, Slevin's skink, 
the Mariana eight-spot butterfly, the Rota blue damselfly, the Guam tree
 snail, the humped tree snail, Langford's tree snail, and the fragile 
tree snail) that are dependent on these ecosystems. We do not have 
sufficient information specific to 2 of the 23 species, <em>Tinospora homosepala</em>
 and the Mariana wandering butterfly, that would lead us to conclude 
that habitat loss as a result of development, military training, or 
urbanization is a threat to these species. For a more thorough 
discussion of previous occupations and current U.S. military activities,

          <h4 id="h-42">Habitat Destruction and Modification by Nonnative Animals</h4>

          <p id="p-195" data-page="59452">Animal species introduced by 
humans, either intentionally or accidentally, are responsible for some 
of the greatest negative impacts to the four Mariana Islands ecosystems 
described here (Stone 1970, pp. 14, 32; Intoh 1986 in Conry 1988, p. 26;
 Fritts and Rodda 1998, p. 130). Although there are numerous reports of 
myriad introduced animal species that have negatively impacted the four 
described Mariana Islands ecosystems, ranging from ungulates to insects 
(including such diverse animals as the musk shrew (<em>Suncus murinus</em>), dogs (<em>Canis lupis familiaris</em>), cats (<em>Felis catus</em>), and black drongoes (birds; <em>Dicrurus macroercus</em>)), <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59453"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59453" data-page="59453" data-text="Start Printed Page 59453" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59453}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59453</span></span></span>we
 have focused our efforts here on the negative impacts of those species 
that impose the greatest harmful effects on the four ecosystems (see 
Tables 3 and 4, above). In addition, we address the compounding effects 
on these ecosystems that arise when the pressure of two or more 
individual negative impacts is greater than the sum of their parts (<em>i.e.,</em>
 synergistic effects). Below we discuss the negative impacts of various 
nonnative animals, including feral pigs, goats, cattle, and water 
buffalo, as well as Philippine deer, rats, and the brown treesnake, 
which impose the greatest adverse impacts on one or more of the 4 
described Mariana Islands ecosystems (forest, savanna, stream, and cave)
 that support the 23 species addressed in this final rule (Stone 1970, 
pp. 14, 32; Intoh 1986 in Conry 1988, p. 26; Fritts and Rodda 1998, pp. 
130-133; Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005, pp. 42, 44, 138, 156-157; 
CNMI-SWARS 2010, pp. 7, 24). Because most of the islands in the Mariana 
archipelago are small (Guam being the largest), the negative impacts 
associated with a destructive nonnative animal species affect the entire
 island. The mild climate of the islands, combined with the lack of 
competitors or predators, has led to the successful establishment of 
large populations of these introduced animals, to the detriment of the 
native Mariana Island species and ecosystems. These effects are 
discussed in more detail, below.</p>
          <h4 id="h-43">Habitat Destruction and Modification by Introduced Ungulates</h4>

          <p id="p-196" data-page="59453">Like most oceanic islands, the
 Mariana Islands, and greater Micronesia, did not support indigenous 
populations of terrestrial mammalian herbivores prior to human 
colonization (Wiles <em>et al.</em> 1999, p. 194). Although agriculture 
and land use by the Chamorro clearly altered the landscape and 
composition of native biota in the Mariana Islands, starting more than 
3,500 years ago (Perry and Morton 1999, p. 126; Steadman 1995, pp. 
1,126-1,127), impacts to the native species and ecosystems of the 
Marianas accelerated following the arrival of Magellan in the 1500s 
(Pregill 1998, p. 66; Perry and Morton 1999, pp. 126-127). The Spanish 
and subsequent explorers intentionally introduced pigs, cattle, goats, 
water buffalo, and Philippine deer to serve as food sources (Fosberg 
1960, p. 54; Conry 1988, pp. 26-28). The isolation of the Mariana 
Islands allowed plant species to evolve without defenses to browsing and
 grazing animals, such as secondary metabolites and spines, making them 
highly susceptible to herbivory (Bowen and Van Vuren 1997, p. 1,249; 
Wiles <em>et al.</em> 1999, p. 194). Introduced mammals have profoundly 
influenced many insular ecosystems around the globe through alteration 
of the physical environment, culminating in the decline and loss of 
native biota (Stone 1970, pp. 14, 32; Scowcroft and Giffin 1983 in Wiles
 <em>et al.</em> 1999, p. 194; Stone 1985, pp. 251, 253-263; Campbell 
and Donlan 2004, pp. 1,363, 1,365), including the Mariana Islands 
ecosystems (Conry 1988, pp. 27-28; Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg 1998, pp.
 250-252, 264; Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005, pp. 42, 44, 138, 156-157; CNMI-SWARS 2010, pp. 7, 24).</p>

          <p id="p-197" data-page="59453">The presence of alien mammals 
is considered one of the primary factors underlying the alteration and 
degradation of native plant communities and habitats on the Mariana 
Islands. The destruction or degradation of habitat due to nonnative 
ungulates, including pigs, goats, cattle, water buffalo, and deer, is 
currently a threat to 17 of the 23 species addressed in this final rule,
 in 2 of the 4 ecosystems (forest and savanna) on 7 of the 15 Mariana 
Islands (Guam, Rota, Aguiguan, Tinian, Alamagan, Pagan, and Agrihan). 
Habitat degradation or destruction by ungulates is a threat to 10 of the
 14 plant species (<em>Cycas micronesica, Eugenia bryanii,</em>
            <em>Hedyotis megalantha, Heritiera longipetiolata,</em>
            <em>Maesa walkeri, Nervilia jacksoniae,</em>
            <em>Phyllanthus saffordii, Psychotria malaspinae,</em>
            <em>Solanum guamense,</em> and <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis</em>),
 and 7 of the 9 animal species (the Pacific sheath-tailed bat, Slevin's 
skink, the Mariana eight-spot butterfly, the Guam tree snail, the humped
 tree snail, Langford's tree snail, and the fragile tree snail) 
addressed in this final rule (Table 3) (Stone 1970, pp. 14, 32; Perlman 
and Wood 1994, pp. 135-136.; Fritts and Rodda 1998, pp. 130-133;

litt.; Marler 2014, in litt.). The three epiphytic orchids (<em>Bulbophyllum guamense, Dendrobium guamense,</em> and <em>Tuberolabium guamense</em>), the vine <em>Tinospora homosepala,</em> the Mariana wandering butterfly and its host plant <em>Maytenus thompsonii,</em>
 and the Rota blue damselfly are not reported to be vulnerable to 
habitat modification and destruction caused by nonnative ungulates.</p>
          <p id="p-198" data-page="59453">
            <em>Pigs—</em> The destruction or degradation of habitat due
 to nonnative feral pigs is currently a threat in 2 (forest and savanna)
 of the 4 Mariana Islands ecosystems and their associated species on 4 
of the 15 islands (Guam, Alamagan, Pagan, and Agrihan) (Berger <em>et al.</em>
 2005, pp. 37-38, 40-44, 51, 95, 114; CNMI-SWARS 2010, p. 15; Kessler 
2011, pp. 320, 323; Pratt 2011, pp. 2, 36). Pigs are present on other 
islands in the archipelago not noted above (<em>i.e.,</em> Rota, Saipan,
 and Tinian); however, they are present in very low numbers, primarily 
on farms and, therefore, not considered a threat on these islands at 
this time.</p>

          <p id="p-199" data-page="59453">Feral pigs are known to cause 
deleterious impacts to ecosystem processes and functions throughout 
their worldwide distribution (Aplet <em>et al.</em> 1991, p. 56; 
Anderson and Stone 1993, p. 201; Campbell and Long 2009, p. 2,319). 
Feral pigs are extremely destructive and have both direct and indirect 
impacts on native plant communities. While rooting in the earth in 
search of invertebrates and plant material, pigs directly impact native 
plants by disturbing and destroying vegetative cover, and trampling 
plants and seedlings. It has been estimated that at a conservative 
rooting rate of 2 square yards (yd<sup>2</sup>) (1.7 m<sup>2</sup>) per minute, with only 4 hours of foraging a day, a single pig could disturb more than 1,600 yd<sup>2</sup> (1,340 m<sup>2</sup>) (or approximately 0.3 ac, or 0.1 ha) of groundcover per week (Anderson <em>et al.</em>
 2007, in litt.). Pigs may also reduce or eliminate plant regeneration 
by damaging or eating seeds and seedlings (further discussion of 
predation by nonnative ungulates is provided under “<em>Factor C. Disease and Predation,”</em>
 below). Pigs are a major vector for the establishment and spread of 
competing invasive, nonnative plant species by dispersing plant seeds on
 their hooves and fur, and in their feces (Diong 1982, pp. 169-170, 
196-197), which also serves to fertilize disturbed soil (Siemann <em>et al.</em>
 2009, p. 547). In addition, pig rooting and wallowing contributes to 
erosion by clearing vegetation and creating large areas of disturbed 
soil, especially on slopes (Smith 1985, pp. 190, 192, 196, 200, 204, 
230-231; Stone 1985, pp. 254-255, 262-264; Tomich 1986, pp. 120-126; 
Cuddihy and Stone 1990, pp. 64-65; Aplet <em>et al.</em> 1991, p. 56; Loope <em>et al.</em> 1991, pp. 18-19; Gagne and Cuddihy 1999, p. 52; Nogueira-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2009, p. 3,681; CNMI-SWARS 2010, p. 15; Dunkell <em>et al.</em>
 2011, pp. 175-177; Kessler 2011, pp. 320, 323). Erosion, resulting from

          <p id="p-200" data-page="59454">In the Hawaiian Islands, pigs 
have been described as the most pervasive and disruptive nonnative 
influence on the unique native forests, and are widely recognized as one
 of the greatest current threats to Hawaii's forest ecosystems (Aplet <em>et al.</em>
 1991, p. 56; Anderson and Stone 1993, p. 195). The negative impacts 
from pig rooting and wallowing described above negatively affects 2 of 
the 4 described ecosystems (forest and savanna), and 14 of the 23 
species (9 plants: <em>Cycas micronesica, Hedyotis megalantha, Heritiera
 longipetiolata, Maesa walkeri, Nervilia jacksoniae, Phyllanthus 
saffordii, Psychotria malaspinae, Solanum guamense,</em> and <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis;</em>
 and 5 animals: Slevin's skink, the Mariana eight-spot butterfly, and 
the Guam tree snail, the humped tree snail, and the fragile tree snail) 
listed as endangered or threatened species in this final rule (Conry 
1988, pp. 27-28; Vogt and Williams 2004, p. 88; Berger <em>et al.</em>

          <p id="p-201" data-page="59454">
            <em>Goats—</em> Habitat destruction or degradation of 
habitat due to nonnative feral goats is currently a threat to three of 
the species addressed in this final rule in two (forest and cave) of the
 four Mariana Islands ecosystems, on the islands of Aguiguan, Alamagan, 
Pagan, and Agrihan (Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005, pp. 36, 38, 40, 42-47; 
CNMI-SWARS 2010, p. 15; Kessler 2011, pp. 320-323; Pratt 2011, pp. 2, 
36). Goats are presumably present on other islands (<em>e.g.,</em> Guam 
and Saipan, and possibly Rota), but these individuals are primarily on 
farms and, therefore, are not considered a threat at this time (Kremer 
2013, in litt.). Three of the 23 species listed as endangered or 
threatened species in this rule (the Pacific sheath-tailed bat, the 
humped tree snail, and Langford's tree snail), within the forest and 
cave ecosystems on the above-mentioned islands, are negatively affected 
by feral goats.</p>

          <p id="p-202" data-page="59454">The feral goat population on 
Aguiguan increased from a handful of animals in 1992 to more than 1,000 
in 2002, which led to the general destruction of the forest ecosystem 
due to lack of regeneration of native plants and almost complete loss of
 understory plants, leaving only two native plants that are unpalatable,
 <em>Cynometra ramiflora</em> and <em>Meiogyne cylindrocarpa</em> (Wiles and Worthington 2002, p. 7; Cruz <em>et al.</em>
 2008, p. 243). In addition, feral goats on Aguiguan have been observed 
entering caves for shelter, which disrupts the endangered Mariana 
swiftlet colonies and is believed to disturb the Pacific sheath-tailed 
bat (Wiles and Worthington 2002, p. 17; Cruz <em>et al.</em> 2008, p. 
243). Researchers found that if caves suitable for bats were occupied by
 goats, there were no bats present in the caves (GDAWR 1995, p. 95). 
Goats are widely recognized to have almost limitless ranges, and are 
able to access, and forage in, extremely rugged terrain (Clarke and 
Cuddihy 1980, pp. C-19, C-20; Culliney 1988, p. 336; Cuddihy and Stone 
1990, p. 64).</p>

          <p id="p-203" data-page="59454">Goats have completely 
eliminated some plant species from islands (Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg 
1998, p. 250; Atkinson and Atkinson 2000, p. 21). Goat browsing 
negatively impacts the habitat that supports the humped tree snail (on 
Aguiguan, Alamagan, and Pagan), and the fragile tree snail and 
Langford's tree snail (on Aguiguan) in the forest ecosystem by altering 
the essential microclimate, leading to increased desiccation and 
disruption of plant decay processes (Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg 1998, 
p. 250). On Agrihan, goats have destroyed much of the shrubs that make 
up the subcanopy, and the herbs in the understory (Ohba 1994, p. 19). In
 addition, goats eat the seeds and seedlings of one of the dominant 
Micronesian (Mariana Islands and Palau) endemic canopy species, <em>Elaeocarpus joga,</em>
 preventing its regeneration (Ohba 1994, p. 19; Ritter and Naugle 1999, 
pp. 275-281). None of the 23 species addressed in this final rule are 
known to currently occur on Agrihan; however, this island may be 
involved in future recovery efforts for 1 or more of the 23 species, and
 2 other listed species, the Mariana fruit bat (<em>Pteropus mariannus mariannus</em>) and the Micronesian megapode (<em>Megapodius laperouse</em>), occur there.</p>
          <p id="p-204" data-page="59454">
            <em>Cattle—</em> Habitat destruction or degradation of 
habitat by feral cattle is currently a threat to one species addressed 
in this final rule (the humped tree snail) in the forest ecosystem on 
the islands of Alamagan and Pagan (Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005, pp. 114,
 218; Kessler 2011, p. 320). Cattle grazing damages the native 
vegetation and contributes to loss of native plant species, and also 
alters the essential microclimate leading to increased desiccation and 
disruption of plant decay processes necessary to support the humped tree
 snail, which currently occurs on the islands of Alamagan and Pagan 
(Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg 1998, p. 261; Pratt 2011, pp. 2, 36; 
Hadfield 2010, 23 pp.; Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005, pp. 114, 218). Feral
 cattle eat native vegetation, trample roots and seedlings, cause 
erosion, create disturbed areas into which alien plants invade, and 
spread seeds of alien plants in their feces and on their bodies. The 
forest in areas grazed by cattle degrades to grassland pasture, and 
plant cover is reduced for many years following removal of cattle from 
an area. Feral cattle have also roamed the island of Tinian for 
centuries and are reported to have negatively affected habitat across 
the island by grazing, trampling plants, and exposing soil, thereby 
changing the microclimate and composition of vegetation (Wiles <em>et al.</em> 1990, pp. 167-180; Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) 2015, in litt.).</p>

          <p id="p-205" data-page="59454">At present the number of feral
 cattle on Tinian is very low, and we do not consider feral cattle to 
currently pose a significant threat to the two species that occur on the
 island (the plant <em>Heritiera longipetiolata,</em> and the humped 
tree snail). However, cattle ranching is gaining in popularity, and in 
the future the number of cattle is expected to double from 1,500 
individuals (Bagnol 2014, in litt.; NRCS 2015, in litt.). The number of 
cattle ranchers on Tinian has risen from 10 or 12 in 2010, to 49 
ranchers by 2014 (Bagnol 2014, in litt.). As numbers of cattle and 
ranchers increase on Tinian, there may be a somewhat greater risk of 
cattle potentially escaping and becoming feral. Both feral and domestic 
cattle can drastically alter the landscape (Wiles <em>et al.</em> pp. 
176-177), and depending on the location and amount of land designated as
 pasture land for domestic cattle, negative impacts to the forest 
ecosystem may be observed in the future. The Pacific sheath-tailed bat, 
and the plants <em>Dendrobium guamense, Solanum guamense,</em> and <em>Tuberolabium guamense,</em> occurred historically on Tinian.</p>

            <em>Water buffalo—</em> Several herds of Asiatic water 
buffalo or carabao roam southern Guam and the Naval Magazine area, and 
cause damage to the forest and savanna ecosystems that support 10 of the
 23 species listed as endangered or threatened species (6 plants: <em>Cycas micronesica, Heritiera longipetiolata, Maesa walkeri, Nervilia jacksoniae, Psychotria malaspinae,</em> and <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis;</em>
 4 animals: The Mariana eight-spot butterfly, the Guam tree snail, the 
humped tree snail, and the fragile tree snail) (Conry 1988, pp. 27-28; 
Harrington <em>et al.</em> 2012, in litt.). Water buffalo create mud 
wallows and trample vegetation (Conry 1988, p. 27). Wallowing pools can 
cover as much as 0.3 ac (0.1 ha) and reach a depth of 3 ft (1.0 m) 
(Conry 1988, p. 27), and <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59455"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59455" data-page="59455" data-text="Start Printed Page 59455" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59455}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59455</span></span></span>trampling
 denudes land cover, leaving erosion scars and slumping (Conry 1988, pp.
 27-28). Water buffalo negatively impact the Mariana eight-spot 
butterfly by damaging the habitat that supports its two host plants (<em>Procris pendunculata</em> and <em>Elatostema calcareum</em>). Although four additional species (the three epiphytic orchids (<em>Bulbophyllum guamense, Dendrobium guamense,</em> and <em>Tuberolabium guamense</em>), and the Mariana wandering butterfly and its host plant <em>Maytenus thompsonii</em>)
 may occur on the Naval Magazine, these four species are not as 
vulnerable to the negative impacts associated with water buffalo.</p>
          <p id="p-207" data-page="59455">
            <em>Deer—</em> Habitat destruction or degradation due to 
Philippine deer is currently a threat to 13 of the 23 species found in 2
 of the 4 described Mariana Island ecosystems (forest and savanna) on 
the islands of Guam and Rota (Wiles <em>et al.</em> 1999, pp. 198-200). 
Philippine deer have caused extensive damage resulting in changes in the
 forest structure, including erosion, grazing to the point of clearing 
the entire herbaceous understory, consumption of seeds and seedlings 
preventing regeneration of native plants and the spread of invasive 
plant species, and other physical damage (<em>e.g.,</em> trunk rubbing) (Schreiner 1997, pp. 179-180; Wiles <em>et al.</em> 1999, pp. 193-215; Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005, pp. 36, 45-46, 100; CNMI-SWARS 2010, p. 24; JGPO-NavFac, Pacific 2010b, p. 3-33; SWCA 2011, pp. 35, 42; Harrington <em>et al.</em>
 2012, in litt.). At least 34 native plant species in the forest 
ecosystem have been documented as known food of the deer on the islands 
of Guam and Rota, including: (1) Genera of 5 plant species addressed in 
this final rule (<em>Cycas</em> spp. (<em>e.g., C. micronesica</em>), <em>Eugenia</em> spp. (<em>e.g., E. bryanii</em>), <em>Heritiera</em> spp. (<em>e.g., H. longipetiolata</em>), <em>Psychotria</em> spp. (<em>e.g., P. malaspinae</em>), and <em>Solanum</em> spp. (<em>e.g., S. guamense</em>); and genera of the 2 host plants, <em>Procris</em> spp. and <em>Elatostema</em> spp., that support the Mariana eight-spot butterfly; (2) several keystone ecosystem species: <em>Artocarpus mariannensis</em> (dokdok, seeded bread fruit), <em>Discocalyx megacarpa</em> (otot), <em>Merrilliodendron megacarpum</em> (faniok), <em>Piper</em> spp., <em>Pipturus argenteus,</em> and <em>Premna obtusifolia</em> (false elder); and (3) the listed plant species <em>Serianthes nelsonii</em> (Wiles <em>et al.</em>
 1999, pp. 198-200, 203; Rubinoff and Haines 2012, in litt.). Philippine
 deer degrade the habitats that support 12 of the 23 species listed as 
endangered or threatened species in this final rule, in the forest and 
savanna ecosystems on the islands of Guam and Rota (8 plants: <em>Cycas 
micronesica, Eugenia bryanii, Heritiera longipetiolata, Maesa walkeri, 
Nervilia jacksoniae, Psychotria malaspinae, Solanum guamense,</em> and <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis;</em> and 4 animals: The Mariana eight-spot butterfly (including the two host plants <em>Procris pendunculata</em> and <em>Elatostema calcareum</em>), the Guam tree snail, the humped tree snail, and the fragile tree snail).</p>

          <p id="p-208" data-page="59455">In summary, the habitats for 
17 of the 23 species within all 4 ecosystems (forest, savanna, stream, 
and cave) identified in this rule are exposed to ongoing destruction and
 modification by feral ungulates (pigs, goats, cattle, and water 
buffalo), and Philippine deer (10 plants: <em>Cycas micronesica, Eugenia
 bryanii, Hedyotis megalantha, Heritiera longipetiolata, Maesa walkeri, 
Nervilia jacksoniae, Phyllanthus saffordii, Psychotria malaspinae, 
Solanum guamense,</em> and <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis;</em> and 7 animals: The Pacific sheath-tailed bat, Slevin's skink, the Mariana eight-spot butterfly (and its two host plants <em>Procris pendunculata</em> and <em>Elatostema calcareum</em>),
 the Guam tree snail, the humped tree snail, Langford's tree snail, and 
the fragile tree snail). The effects of these nonnative animals include:
 (1) The destruction of vegetative cover and the required microclimate 
of the 4 tree snails, (2) trampling of plants and seedlings and direct 
consumption of native vegetation and the 10 plants, as well as the host 
plants for the 2 butterflies, (3) altering the native ecosystems that 
provide habitat for the 10 plants and 7 animals by soil disturbance 
leading to erosion and sedimentation, (4) dispersal of alien plant seeds
 on hooves and coats and in feces, which contributes to invasion and 
alteration of ecosystems required by the 10 plants and 7 animals, (5) 
alteration of soil nitrogen availability, and creation of open areas 
conducive to further invasion of native ecosystems by nonnative pest 
plant species, and (6) alteration of food availability for the Pacific 
sheath-tailed bat by destruction of native forest and the associated 
insect prey. All of these impacts lead to the subsequent conversion of a
 plant community dominated by native species to one dominated by 
nonnative species (see “Habitat Destruction and Modification by 
Nonnative Plants,” below). In addition, because these nonnative animals 
inhabit terrain that is often steep and rugged (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, 
pp. 64-65; Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005, pp. 36-38, 40-47, 51, 95, 100, 
114, 218), foraging and trampling contribute to severe erosion of 
watersheds. Nonnative ungulates would thus pose a potential threat to 
the Rota blue damselfly's stream habitat, if these ungulates were 
allowed to roam freely on Rota (Dunkell <em>et al.</em> 2011, p. 192).</p>

            <em>Rats—</em> There are three rat species found in the Mariana Islands: (1) The Polynesian rat (<em>Rattus exulans</em>), the only rat found in prehistoric fossil records; (2) the Norway rat (<em>R. norvegicus</em>); and (3) a putative new southeast Asian <em>Rattus</em> species, originally thought to be <em>R. diardii</em> (synonymous with <em>R. tanezumi</em>) (Kuroda 1938 in Wiewel <em>et al.</em> 2009, p. 208; Wiewel <em>et al.</em> 2009, pp. 210, 214-216; Pages <em>et al.</em> 2010, p. 200; Pages <em>et al.</em> 2013, pp. 1,019-1,020). One or more of these rat species are present on all 15 Mariana Islands (Wiewel <em>et al.</em>
 2009, pp. 205-222; Kessler 2011, p. 320). Rats are a threat to the 
forest and savanna ecosystems that support 22 of the 23 species listed 
as endangered or threatened in this final rule (all 14 plant species and
 8 of 9 animal species—all except the Rota blue damselfly in the stream 
ecosystem), by affecting regeneration of native vegetation, thereby 
destroying or eliminating the associated flora and fauna of these 
ecosystems.</p>
          <p id="p-210" data-page="59455">Rats are recognized as one of 
the most destructive invasive vertebrates, causing significant 
ecological, economic, and health impacts (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, pp. 
68-69; Atkinson and Atkinson 2000, pp. 23-24). Rats impact native plants
 by eating fleshy fruits, seeds, flowers, stems, leaves, roots, and 
other plant parts (Atkinson and Atkinson 2000, p. 23), and can seriously
 affect plant regeneration. A New Zealand study of rats in native 
forests has demonstrated that, over time, differential regeneration of 
plants, as a consequence of rat predation, may alter the species 
composition of forested areas (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, p. 69). Rats have
 caused declines or even the complete elimination of island plant 
species (Campbell and Atkinson 1999, in Atkinson and Atkinson 2000, p. 
24). Plants with fleshy fruits are particularly susceptible to rat 
predation (Stone 1985, p. 264; Cuddihy and Stone 1990, pp. 67-69).</p>

          <p id="p-211" data-page="59455">Rats also impact the faunal 
composition of ecosystems by predation or competition with native 
amphibian, avian, invertebrate, mammalian, and reptilian species, often 
resulting in population declines or even extirpations; disruption of 
island trophic systems including nutrient cycling; and by the creation 
of novel vectors and reservoirs for diseases and parasites (Pickering 
and Norris 1996 in Wiewel <em>et al.</em> 2009, p. 205; Chanteau <em>et <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59456"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59456" data-page="59456" data-text="Start Printed Page 59456" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59456}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59456</span></span></span>al.</em> 1998 in Wiewel <em>et al.</em> 2009, p. 205; Fukami <em>et al.</em> 2006, pp. 1,302-1,303; Towns <em>et al.</em> 2006, pp. 876-877; Wiewel <em>et al.</em> 2009, p. 205).</p>

          <p id="p-212" data-page="59456">Rats are less numerous on Guam
 compared to Rota, Saipan, and Tinian, due to the presence of the brown 
treesnake (see “Brown Treesnake,” below) (Wiewel <em>et al.</em> 2009, 
p. 210). An inverse relationship has been observed between rat density 
and the density of the brown treesnake, as rats are a food source and, 
therefore, contribute toward the brown treesnake's persistence (Rodda 
and Savidge 2007, p. 315; Wiewel <em>et al.</em> 2009, p. 218). Rodda <em>et al.</em> (1991, in Berger <em>et al.</em>
 2005, p. 175) suggests that rats negatively impact native reptile 
populations, such as Slevin's skink, by aggressively competing for 
habitat. Several restoration studies have shown rapid increases in skink
 populations after removal of rats (Towns <em>et al.</em> 2001, pp. 6, 9).</p>
          <p id="p-213" data-page="59456">
            <em>Brown treesnake—</em> The brown treesnake, native to 
coastal eastern Australia and north through Papua New Guinea and 
Melanesia, was accidentally introduced to Guam shortly after World War 
II (Rodda and Savidge 2007, p. 307). This arboreal, nocturnal snake was 
first observed near the Fena Reservoir in the Santa Rita area, and now 
occupies all ecosystems on Guam (Rodda and Savidge 2007, p. 314). There 
are reported sightings of the brown treesnake on Saipan; however, there 
are no known established populations on Saipan at this time (Campbell 
2014, pers. comm.; Phillips 2014, pers. comm.). On September 3, 2014, a 
brown treesnake was captured in a snake trap along the Rota Seaport 
fence line promptly initiating extensive island-wide surveys that did 
not detect any others (Phillips 2015, in litt.). The brown treesnake is 
believed responsible for the extirpation of 13 of Guam's 22 native bird 
species (including all but 1 of its native forest bird species), and for
 contributing to the elimination of the Mariana fruit bat, the Pacific 
sheath-tailed bat, and Slevin's skink populations from the island (Rodda
 and Savidge 2007, p. 307).</p>

          <p id="p-214" data-page="59456">The loss or severe reduction 
of so many bird species and other small native animal species on Guam 
has ecosystem-wide impacts, since many of these bird and small animal 
species were responsible for seed dispersal and pollination of native 
plants (Perry and Morton 1999, p. 137; Rodda and Savidge 2007, p. 311; 
Rogers 2008, in litt.; Rogers 2011, pp. 1-75). Some report that the 
brown treesnake has eliminated virtually all native seed dispersers 
(Fritts and Rodda 1998, p. 129). Field studies have demonstrated that 
seed dispersal of selected native plant species (<em>Aglaia mariannensis, Elaeocarpus joga,</em> and <em>Premna obtusifolia</em>)
 have declined on Guam as compared to neighboring islands (Rota, Saipan,
 and Tinian), due to brown treesnake predation on native birds and other
 small native vertebrate species (Ritter and Naugle 1999, pp. 275-281; 
Rogers 2008, in litt.; Rogers 2009, in litt.; Rogers 2011, pp. 1-75). 
Almost three quarters of the native tree species on Guam were once 
dependent on birds to eat their fruits and disperse their seeds (Rogers 
2009, in litt.; Rogers 2011, pp. 1-75). Detailed studies on the native 
tree <em>P. obtusifolia</em> show that seeds handled by birds are twice 
as likely to germinate than seeds that fall off the tree and land 
directly below on the forest floor (by either simply nicking the seed 
and dropping it, or fully digesting the outer seed coat and excreting it
 in feces) (Rogers 2009, in litt.; Rogers 2011, pp. 1-75). An impact at 
one trophic level (elimination of seed dispersers) has cascading effects
 on other trophic levels, and can affect ecosystem stability (Perry and 
Morton 1999, p. 137).</p>
          <p id="p-215" data-page="59456">The brown treesnake's 
elimination of native plant seed dispersers is an indirect threat that 
negatively impacts 2 of the 4 described ecosystems (forest and savanna),
 and the habitat of 18 of the 23 species (all 14 plant species and 4 of 
the 9 animal species, including the Mariana eight-spot butterfly, the 
Guam tree snail, the humped tree snail, and the fragile tree snail) 
listed as endangered or threatened in this final rule.</p>
          <h4 id="h-45">Habitat Destruction and Modification by Nonnative Plants</h4>

          <p id="p-216" data-page="59456">Native vegetation on the 
Mariana Islands has undergone extreme alteration because of past and 
present land management practices, including ranching, the deliberate 
introduction of nonnative plants and animals, agricultural development, 
military actions, and war (Ohba 1994, pp. 17, 28, 54-69; Mueller-Dombois
 and Fosberg 1998, p. 242; Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005, pp. 45, 105, 
110, 218, 347, 350; CNMI-SWARS 2010, pp. 7, 9, 13, 16). Some nonnative 
plants were brought to the Mariana Islands by various groups of people, 
including the Chamorro, for food or cultural reasons.</p>

          <p id="p-217" data-page="59456">The native flora of the 
Mariana Islands (plant species that were present before humans arrived) 
consisted of no more than 500 taxa, 10 percent of which were endemic 
(species that occur only in the Mariana Islands). Over 100 plant taxa 
have been introduced from elsewhere, and at least one third of these 
have become pests (<em>i.e.,</em> injurious plants) (Stone 1970, pp. 
18-21; Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg 1998, pp. 242-243, 249, 262-263;

          <p id="p-229" data-page="59457">Fire is a human-exacerbated 
threat to native species and native ecosystems throughout the Mariana 
Islands, particularly on the island of Guam. Wildfires plague forest and
 savanna areas on Guam every dry season despite the island's humid 
climate, with at least 80 percent of wildfires resulting from arson 
(JGPO-NavFac, Pacific 2010b, p. 1-9). Deer hunters on Guam and Rota 
frequently create fires in order to lure deer to new growth for easier 
hunting (Boland 2014, in litt.; Kremer 2014, in litt.). It is not 
uncommon for these fires to become wildfires that spread across large 
expanses of the savanna ecosystem as well as into the adjacent forest 
ecosystem. Between 1979 and 2001, more than 750 fires were reported 
annually on Guam, burning more than 155 mi<sup>2</sup> (401 km<sup>2</sup>)
 during this time period (JGPO-NavFac, Pacific 2010b, p. 1-8). Six of 
these 750 fires burned more than 1,000 ac (405 hectares (ha)) 
(JGPO-NavFac, Pacific 2010b, p. 1-8). On the island of Rota, fires are 
often set on the Sabana by hunters, which burn into adjacent native 
forest.</p>

          <p id="p-230" data-page="59457">Fire can destroy dormant seeds
 of native species as well as plants themselves, even in steep or 
inaccessible areas. Successive fires that burn farther and farther into 
native habitat destroy native plants and remove habitat for native 
species by altering microclimate conditions to those favorable to alien 
plants. Alien plant species most likely to be spread as a consequence of
 fire are those that produce a high fuel load, are adapted to survive 
and regenerate after fire, and establish rapidly in newly burned areas. 
Grasses (particularly those that produce mats of dry material or retain a
 mass of standing dead leaves) that invade native forests and shrublands
 provide fuels that allow fire to burn areas that would not otherwise 
easily burn (Fujioka and Fujii 1980 in Cuddihy and Stone 1990, p. 93; 
D'Antonio and Vitousek 1992, pp. 70, 73-74; Tunison <em>et al.</em> 
2002, p. 122). Native woody plants may recover from fire to some degree,
 but fire shifts the competitive balance toward alien species (National 
Park Service (NPS) 1989 in Cuddihy and Stone 1990, p. 93). Another 
factor that contributes to wildfires on Guam, and other Mariana Islands 
with nonnative ungulates, includes land clearing for pasturage and 
ranching, which results in fire-prone areas of nonnative grasses and 
shrubs (Stone 1970, p. 32; CNMI-SWARS 2010, pp. 7, 20). Further, the 
danger of fire increases following intense typhoons, due to large fuel 
accumulation (Donnelly 2010, p. 6).</p>
          <p id="p-231" data-page="59457">Wildfire is a threat to nine plant species (<em>Bulbophyllum guamense, Cycas micronesica, Dendrobium guamense, Hedyotis megalantha,</em>

          <h4 id="h-47">Habitat Destruction and Modification by Typhoons</h4>

          <p id="p-232" data-page="59458">The Mariana Islands lie in the
 western North Pacific basin, which is the world's most prolific typhoon
 basin, with an annual average of 26 named tropical cyclones between 
1951 and 2010, depending on the database used (Keener <em>et al.</em> 
2012, p. 50). Typhoons are seasonal, occurring more often in the summer,
 and tend to be more intense during El Niño years (Gualdi <em>et al.</em>
 2008, pp. 5,205, 5,208, 5,226). In May 2015, Typhoon Dolphin passed 
between Guam and Rota, initiating a disaster declaration by the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for Guam and by the CNMI Governor for
 the island of Rota (FEMA 2015a, in litt.). Then, in August 2015, 
Typhoon Soudelor slammed directly into Saipan destroying buildings and 
downing trees and power lines, thus initiating a second major disaster 
declaration for the Mariana Islands this year (FEMA 2015b, in litt.). 
Additionally, in 2013, one of the strongest typhoons ever recorded 
(Typhoon Haiyan) passed just south of the Marianas and struck the 
Philippines. Between 2002 and 2005, three typhoons (Typhoon Chataan 
(2002), Typhoon Tingting (2004), and Typhoon Nabi (2005)) and two super 
typhoons (Super Typhoon Pongsona (2002) and Super Typhoon Chaba (2004)) 
struck the Mariana Islands (FEMA 2014, in litt.). In the previous 20 
years (between 1976 and 1997), only eight typhoons reached the island 
chain that caused damage warranting FEMA assistance (FEMA 2014, in 
litt.).</p>

          <p id="p-233" data-page="59458">Typhoons may cause destruction
 of native vegetation and open the native canopy, thus modifying the 
availability of light, and creating disturbed areas conducive to 
invasion by nonnative pest species and nonnative plant species that 
compete for space, water, and nutrients, and alter basic water and 
nutrient cycling processes. This process leads to decreased growth and 
reproduction for all 14 plant species addressed in this final rule (see 
Table 3, above), and for the host plants (<em>Procris pendunculata, Elatostema calcareum,</em> and <em>Maytenus thompsonii</em>)
 for the 2 butterfly species (Perlman 1992, 9 pp.; Kitayama and 
Mueller-Dombois 1995, p. 671). Additionally, typhoons initiate a large 
pulse in the accumulation of debris and often trigger landslides with 
large debris flows (Lugo 2008, pp. 368, 372), as well as induce 
defoliation and wind-thrown trees, which can create conditions favorable
 to wildfires or result in the direct damage or destruction of 
individuals of the 14 plant species addressed in this final rule. 
Further, typhoon frequency globally may decrease; however, there may be 
some regional increases (<em>e.g.,</em> in the western north Pacific), with an increase in the frequency of higher intensity events due to climate change (Emanuel <em>et al.</em> 2008, p. 361).</p>

          <p id="p-234" data-page="59458">Typhoons are a natural 
occurrence in the Pacific Islands, and the native species here have 
coevolved with such natural disturbances. However, when species have 
become greatly reduced in numbers or distribution due to other factors, 
even a natural disturbance can constitute a significant threat, and can 
result in local extirpation or even extinction. Typhoons pose a threat 
to the nine animal species listed as endangered species in this rule, 
because the associated high winds may dislodge larvae, juveniles, or 
adult individuals from their host plants, caves, or streams, thereby 
increasing the likelihood of mortality caused by lack of essential 
nutrients for proper development; increase their exposure to predators (<em>e.g.,</em> rats, brown treesnake, monitor lizards, ants) (see “<em>Factor C. Disease and Predation,”</em>
 below); destroy host plants; open up the canopy and alter the 
microclimate; or cause direct physical damage or mortality. Damage by 
subsequent typhoons could further decrease the remaining native 
plant-dominated habitat areas, and the associated food resources, that 
support the nine animal species. For plant and animal species that 
persist only in low numbers and restricted ranges, such as the 23 
Mariana Islands species addressed here, natural disasters, such as 
typhoons, can be particularly devastating (Mitchell <em>et al.</em> 
2005, p. 4-3). Although typhoons would not normally be considered a 
threat to native species, in cases such as these the species are 
vulnerable due to reductions in abundance and range as a consequence of 
other threat factors.</p>
          <h4 id="h-48">Habitat Destruction and Modification by Climate Change</h4>

          <p id="p-235" data-page="59458">Our analyses under the Act 
include consideration of ongoing and projected changes in climate. The 
terms “climate” and “climate change” are defined by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). “Climate” refers to 
the mean and variability of different types of weather conditions over 
time, with 30 years being a typical period for such measurements, 
although shorter or longer periods also may be used (Le Treut <em>et al.</em> 2007, p. 96). The term “climate change” thus refers to a change in the mean or variability of one or more measures of climate (<em>e.g.,</em>
 temperature or precipitation) that persists for an extended period, 
typically decades or longer, whether the change is due to natural 
variability, human activity, or both (Le Treut <em>et al.</em> 2007, p. 
104). Various types of changes in climate can have direct or indirect 
effects on species. These effects may be positive, neutral, or negative,
 and they may change over time, depending on the species and other 
relevant considerations, such as the effects of interactions of climate 
with other variables (<em>e.g.,</em> habitat fragmentation) (IPCC 2007, pp. 8-14, 18).</p>

          <p id="p-236" data-page="59458">Climate change will be a 
particular challenge for the conservation of biodiversity because the 
introduction and interaction of additional stressors may push species 
beyond their ability to survive (Lovejoy 2005, pp. 325-326). The 
synergistic implications of climate change and habitat fragmentation are
 the most threatening facet of climate change for biodiversity (Hannah <em>et al.</em>
 2005, p. 4). The magnitude and intensity of the impacts of global 
climate change and increasing temperatures on native Mariana Island 
ecosystems are unknown. Currently, there are no climate change studies 
that specifically address impacts to the specific Mariana Island 
ecosystems discussed here or any of the 23 individual species addressed 
in this final rule that are associated with these ecosystems. There are,
 however, climate change studies that address potential changes in the 
tropical Pacific on a broader scale. Based on the best available 
information, climate change impacts could lead to the loss of native 
species that comprise the communities in which the 23 species occur 
(Pounds <em>et al.</em> 1999, pp. 611-612; Still <em>et al.</em> 1999, p. 610; Benning <em>et al.</em> 2002, pp. 14,246-14,248; Allen <em>et al.</em> 2010, pp. 668-669; Sturrock <em>et al.</em> 2011, p. 144; Townsend <em>et al.</em>
 2011, pp. 14-15; Warren 2011, pp. 165-166). In addition, weather regime
 changes (droughts, floods, typhoons) will likely result from increased 
annual average temperatures related to more frequent El Niño episodes as
 hypothesized for other Pacific Island chains (Giambelluca <em>et al.</em>
 1991, p. iii). Future changes in precipitation and the forecast of 
those changes are highly uncertain because they depend, in part, on how 
the El Niño-La Niña weather cycle (a disruption of the ocean atmospheric
 system in the tropical Pacific having important global consequences for
 weather and climate) might change (State of Hawaii 1998, p. 2-10). <em></em>
 The 23 species listed as endangered or threatened species in this final
 rule are vulnerable to extinction due to anticipated environmental 
changes that may result from global climate change, <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59459"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59459" data-page="59459" data-text="Start Printed Page 59459" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59459}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59459</span></span></span>due
 to their small population size and highly restricted ranges. 
Environmental changes that are likely to affect these species are 
expected to include habitat loss or alteration and changes in 
disturbance regimes (<em>e.g.,</em> storms and typhoons).</p>

          <p id="p-237" data-page="59459">The range of global surface 
warming since 1979 is 0.29 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) to 0.32 °F (0.16 
degrees Celsius (°C) to 0.18 °C) per decade (Trenberth <em>et al.</em> 
2007, p. 237). Globally, the annual number of warm nights increased by 
about 25 days since 1951, with the greatest increase since the mid-1970s
 (Alexander <em>et al.</em> 2006, pp. 7-8). The bulk of the increase in 
mean temperature is related to a larger increase in minimum temperatures
 compared to the increase in maximum temperatures (Giambelluca <em>et al.</em>
 2008, p. 1). Globally averaged, 2012 ranked as the eighth or ninth 
warmest year since records began in the mid- to late 1800s (Lander and 
Guard 2013, p. S-11).</p>

          <p id="p-238" data-page="59459">To date, climate change 
indicators specific to the Mariana Islands have not been published; 
however, data collected on climate change indicators from the Pacific 
Region, (<em>e.g.,</em> the Hawaiian Islands) show that predicted 
changes associated with increases in temperature include, but are not 
limited to, a shift in vegetation zones upslope, shifts in animal 
species' ranges, changes in mean precipitation with unpredictable 
effects on local environments, increased occurrence of drought cycles, 
and increases in the intensity and number of hurricanes (<em>i.e.,</em> typhoons) (Loope and Giambelluca 1998, pp. 514-515; Emanuel <em>et al.</em> 2008, p. 365; U.S. Global Change Research Program (US-GCRP) 2009, pp. 145-149, 153; Keener <em>et al.</em> 2010, pp. 25-28; Finucane <em>et al.</em> 2012, pp. 23-26; Keener <em> et al.</em>
 2012, pp. 47-51). It is reasonable to extrapolate these predictions to 
the Mariana Islands as climate in this area is strongly influenced by 
the phase of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (Lander and Guard 
2013, pp. S192-S194). In addition, weather regime changes (<em>e.g.,</em>
 droughts, floods, and typhoons) will likely result from increased 
annual average temperatures related to more frequent El Niño episodes in
 the Mariana Islands (Keener <em>et al.</em> 2012, pp. 35-37, 47-51), and elsewhere in the Pacific (Giambelluca <em>et al.</em>
 1991, p. iii). However, despite considerable progress made by expert 
scientists toward understanding the impacts of climate change on many of
 the processes that contribute to El Niño variability, it is not 
possible to say whether or not El Niño activity will be affected by 
climate change (Collins <em>et al.</em> 2010, p. 391).</p>

          <p id="p-239" data-page="59459">As global surface temperature 
rises, the evaporation of water vapor increases, resulting in higher 
concentrations of water vapor in the atmosphere, further resulting in 
altered global precipitation patterns (U.S. National Science and 
Technology Council (US-NSTC) 2008, pp. 60-61; US-GCRP 2009, pp. 
145-146). While annual global precipitation has increased over the last 
100 years, the combined effect of increases in evaporation and 
evapotranspiration is causing land surface drying in some regions 
leading to a greater incidence and severity of drought (US-NSTC 2008, 
pp. 60-61; US-GCRP 2009, pp. 145-146). Over the past 100 years, most of 
the Pacific has experienced an annual decline in precipitation; however,
 the western North Pacific (<em>e.g.,</em> western Micronesia, including
 the Mariana Islands) has experienced a slight increase (up to 14 
percent on some islands) (US-NSTC 2008, p. 63; Keener <em>et al.</em> 
2010, pp. 53-54). Increases in rain are associated with alterations in 
faunal breeding systems and increases in disease prevalence, flooding, 
and erosion (Easterling <em>et al.</em> 2000, p. 2,073; Harvell <em>et al.</em> 2002, pp. 2,159-2,161; Nearing <em>et al.</em>
 2004, pp. 48-49). It should be noted that, although the western North 
Pacific typically experiences large amounts of rainfall annually, 
drought is a serious concern throughout Micronesia due to limited 
storage capacity and small groundwater supplies (Keener <em>et al.</em> 
2012, pp. 49, 58, 119). Future changes in precipitation in the Mariana 
Islands are uncertain because they depend, in part, on how the El 
Niño-La Niña weather cycle might change (State of Hawaii 1998, p. 2-10).
 Long periods of decline in annual precipitation result in a reduction 
in moisture availability, loss of wet forest, an increase in drought 
frequency, and a self-perpetuating cycle of invasion by nonnative 
plants, increasing fire-cycles, and increasing erosion.</p>

          <p id="p-240" data-page="59459">Climate modeling has projected
 changes in typhoon frequency and intensity due to global warming over 
the next 100 to 200 years (Emanuel <em>et al.</em> 2008, p. 360, Figure 8; Yu <em>et al.</em>
 2010, pp. 1,355-1,356, 1,369-1,370); however, there are no certain 
climate model predictions for a change in the duration of Pacific 
tropical cyclone storm season (which generally runs from May through 
November) (Collins <em>et al.</em> 2010, p. 396). A typhoon (as a 
tropical cyclone is referred to in the Northwest Pacific ocean) is the 
generic term for a medium- to large-scale, low-pressure storm system 
over tropical or subtropical waters with organized convection (<em>i.e.,</em>
 thunderstorm activity) and definite cyclonic surface wind circulation 
(counterclockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere) (Holland 1993, 
p. 7, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 2011, in 
litt.). In the north Pacific Ocean, west of the International Date Line,
 once a typhoon reaches an intensity of winds of at least 150 mi per 
hour (65 m per second), it is classified as a super typhoon (Neumann 
1993, pp. 1-2; NOAA 2011, in litt.). The high winds and strong storm 
surges associated with typhoons, particularly super typhoons, have 
periodically caused great damage to the vegetation of the Mariana 
Islands.</p>

          <p id="p-241" data-page="59459">On a global scale, sea level 
is rising as a result of thermal expansion of warming ocean water; the 
melting of ice sheets, glaciers, and ice caps; and the addition of water
 from terrestrial systems (Climate Institute 2011, in litt.). Sea level 
rose at an average rate of 0.1 in (3.1 mm) per year between 1961 and 
2003 (IPCC AR4 2007, p. 30), with a predicted increase in 2100 of 1.6 to
 4.6 ft (0.5 to 1.4 m) above the 1990 level (Rahmstorf 2007, p. 368). 
Seven of the 23 species (5 plants: <em>Bulbophyllum guamense, Cycas micronesica,</em>
            <em>Dendrobium guamense, Heritiera longipetiolata,</em> and <em>Nervilia jacksoniae;</em> and 2 animals: the humped tree snail and the Mariana eight-spot butterfly (indirectly through impacts to its 2 host plants (<em>Procris pendunculata</em> and <em>Elatostema calcareum</em>))
 have individuals that occur close to the coast in the adjacent forest 
ecosystem at or near sea-level and may be negatively impacted by 
sea-level rise and coastal inundation due to climate change; however, 
there is no specific data available on how sea-level rise and coastal 
inundation will impact these species.</p>

          <p id="p-242" data-page="59459">In summary, we conclude that 
the projected effects of climate change, including increased variability
 of ambient temperature, precipitation, typhoons, and sea-level rise and
 inundation would provide additional stresses on the 4 ecosystems and 
each of the 23 associated species because they are highly vulnerable to 
disturbance and related invasion of nonnative species, thus exacerbating
 the current threats to the species. The risk of extinction as a result 
of such factors increases when a species' range is restricted, its 
habitat decreases, and its population numbers decline (IPCC 2007, pp. 
8-11). These 23 species face this greater risk of extinction due to the 
loss of redundancy and resiliency created by their limited ranges, 
restricted habitat requirements, small population sizes, or low numbers 
of individuals. We therefore conclude <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59460"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59460" data-page="59460" data-text="Start Printed Page 59460" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59460}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59460</span></span></span>these
 23 species are vulnerable to the projected environmental impacts that 
may result from changes in climate and subsequent impacts to their 
habitats (Loope and Giambelluca 1998, pp. 504-505; Pounds <em>et al.</em> 1999, pp. 611-612; Still <em>et al.</em> 1999, p. 610; Benning <em>et al.</em>
 2002, pp. 14,246-14,248; Giambelluca and Luke 2007, pp. 13-15). Even 
natural stochastic events such as typhoons pose a heightened risk under 
such conditions, since such an event is capable of eliminating all or a 
significant proportion of remaining individuals of these species. Based 
on the above information, changes in environmental conditions that 
result from climate change are likely to negatively impact the 23 
species listed as endangered or threatened species in this rule. The 
projected effects of increasing temperature, and other aspects of 
climate change on the 23 species may be direct, such as physiological 
stress caused by increased temperature or lack of moisture, or indirect,
 such as the modification or destruction of habitat, increased 
competition by nonnative species, and changes in disturbance regimes 
that lead to changes in habitat (<em>e.g.,</em> fire, increased 
incidence or intensity of typhoons). The specific and cumulative effects
 of climate change on each of these 23 species are presently unknown, 
but we anticipate that these effects, if realized, will exacerbate the 
current threats to these species.</p>

Extinction Prevention Program (GPEPP) was formed to address conservation
 concerns for a select group of native Mariana Islands plant species, 
including three of the plant species addressed in this final rule: <em>Heritiera longipetiolata, Maesa walkeri,</em> and <em>Psychotria malaspinae.</em>
 GPEPP is a partnership between the University of Guam (UOG), multiple 
Federal agencies (USFWS, DOD, and USDA), Hawaii State DLNR, and the 
Hawaii Plant Extinction Prevention Program (Hawaii PEPP). The goal of 
GPEPP is to prevent the extinction of native Mariana Islands plant 
species that have fewer than 200 individuals remaining in the wild on 
the island of Guam (GPEPP 2014, in litt.). The group currently has 
funding limitations, so they are focusing their efforts on tree species.
 The program's main objectives are to monitor, collect, survey, manage, 
and reintroduce native plant species in the Mariana Islands. They plan 
to work with conservation partners to protect wild populations and 
preserve genetic material (GPEPP 2014, in litt.).</p>

          <p id="p-245" data-page="59460">A conservation project on

analyze the island's hydrology, with the ultimate goal of protection of 
the Sabana Watershed and Talakhaya Springs (Keel <em>et al.</em> 2007, 
pp. 5, 22-23). Erosion control, revegetation, and water source 
preservation conducted as part of this project may provide protection to
 9 of the 23 species in this final rule that currently or historically

This resulted in the removal of ungulates from Sarigan, which has 
improved native habitat that supports two species in this final rule, 
the humped tree snail and Slevin's skink, by decreasing the impacts of 
trampling and browsing on native plants. Sarigan may serve as a location
 for recovery of Slevin's skink and the humped tree snail.</p>

 Guam has been working to prevent the inadvertent spread of the snake to
 other locations, and to reduce negative impacts by the brown treesnake 
on economic and ecological resources. Experimentation with toxicant 
drops to control the brown treesnake is ongoing. The U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, Wildlife Services, is the lead agency for this work, in 
cooperation with the National Wildlife Research Center, U.S. Geological 
Survey, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the U.S. Department of 
Defense. Results of the toxicant drops are currently under review 
(Phillips 2014, in litt.). Additionally, in fiscal year (FY) 2014, the 
Navy funded $1.8 million in projects to meet objectives for control, 
suppression, and eradication of brown treesnakes to benefit native 
species, including the 23 species addressed in this rule, and their 
habitat. Funding has been programmed to continue this effort through 
2021. Also in FY2014 the Navy funded $3.3 million for control and 
containment to prevent the spread and establishment of brown treesnakes 
to new areas, including the CNMI where 17 of the 23 species addressed in
 this final rule occur.</p>

          <p id="p-248" data-page="59460">Area 50, a 59-ac (24-ha) 
exclosure on Andersen AFB on Guam containing a relictual patch of 
limestone forest, was created to exclude ungulates and the brown 
treesnake (Hess and Pratt 2006, p. 2). This enclosure was maintained for
 ecosystem and species experimental research. Several individuals of the
 tree <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis</em> occur within the enclosure, and 
would benefit from protection from predators and habitat disturbance 
(Hess and Pratt 2006, p. 7). However, researchers found the enclosure in
 a state of neglect, and invaded by nonnative plant species and pigs, 
with only 20 ac (8 ha) of undisturbed primary forest remaining by 2006 
(Hess and Pratt 2006, p. 24). We are unaware of any efforts to continue 
maintenance of this enclosure since that time. In 2014, the Air Force 
completed the construction of a 306-ac (124-ha) exclosure on Andersen 
AFB (U.S. Department of Navy (DON) 2014, in litt.); however, through the
 Joint Guam Program Office (JGPO), the U.S. Navy has proposed a 
live-fire training range within a large portion of the fenced area. 
Additionally, this exclosure is a mitigation measure for a previous DOD 
action (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance Strike Project). 
There are proposed mitigation measures associated with the new live-fire
 training range, but because they are only proposed at this time they 
are not included in this final rule. Also in 2014, the Navy also funded a
 project to examine the distribution and abundance of <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis</em> on Joint Regional Marianas (JRM) lands (DON 2014, in litt.).</p>

          <h4 id="h-50">Summary of Habitat Destruction and Modification</h4>
          <p id="p-251" data-page="59461">The threats to the habitats of
 each of the 23 Mariana Islands species are occurring throughout the 
entire range of each of the species, except where noted above, with 
consequent deleterious effects on individuals and populations of these 
species. These threats include land conversion by agriculture and 
urbanization, habitat destruction and modification by nonnative animals 
and plants, fire, the potential alteration of environmental conditions 
resulting from climate change, and compounded impacts due to the 
interaction of these threats. While the conservation measures described 
above address some threats to the 23 species, due to the pervasive and 
expansive nature of the threats resulting in habitat degradation, these 
measures are insufficient to eliminate these threats to any of the 23 
species addressed in this final rule.</p>
          <p id="p-252" data-page="59461">Development and urbanization 
represents a serious and ongoing threat to 21 of the 23 species because 
they cause permanent loss and degradation of habitat.</p>
          <p id="p-253" data-page="59461">The effects from ungulates are
 ongoing because ungulates currently occur in all 4 ecosystems that 
support the 23 species in this final rule. The threat of habitat 
destruction and modification posed by introduced ungulates is serious, 
because they cause: (1) Trampling and grazing that directly impacts 
plants, including 10 of the 14 plant species addressed in this rule, and
 the 2 host plants used by the Mariana eight-spot butterfly for shelter,
 foraging, and reproduction; (2) increased soil disturbance, leading to 
mechanical damage to individuals of 10 of the 14 plant species, and also
 the host plants for the Mariana eight-spot butterfly; (3) creation of 
open, disturbed areas conducive to weedy plant invasion and 
establishment of alien plants from dispersed fruits and seeds, which 
results over time in the conversion of a community dominated by native 
vegetation to one dominated by nonnative vegetation; and (4) increased 
erosion, leading to destabilization of soils that support native plant 
communities, elimination of herbaceous understory vegetation, and 
creation of disturbed areas into which nonnative plants invade. The 
brown treesnake and rats both negatively impact the four ecosystems by 
eating native animals that native plants rely on to disperse seeds, 
limiting the regenerative capacity of the native forest. These threats 
are expected to continue or increase without ungulate control or 
eradication.</p>
          <p id="p-254" data-page="59461">Nonnative plants represent a 
serious and ongoing threat to 20 of the 23 species addressed in this 
final rule (all 14 plant species, the Mariana eight-spot butterfly, the 
Rota blue damselfly, and all 4 tree snails) (see Table 3) through 
habitat destruction and modification, because they: (1) Adversely impact
 microhabitat by modifying the availability of light; (2) alter 
soil-water regimes; (3) modify nutrient cycling processes; (4) alter 
fire characteristics of native plant habitat, leading to incursions of 
fire-tolerant nonnative plant species into native habitat; (5) 
outcompete, and possibly directly inhibit the growth of, native plant 
species; and (6) create opportunities for subsequent establishment of 
nonnative vertebrates and invertebrates. Each of these threats can 
convert native-dominated plant communities to nonnative plant 
communities (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, p. 74; Vitousek 1992, pp. 33-36). 
This conversion has negative impacts on all 14 plant species addressed 
here, as well as the native plant species upon which the Mariana 
eight-spot butterfly and the Rota blue damselfly depend for essential 
life-history needs. For example, nonnative plants that outcompete native
 plants can destabilize streambanks, exacerbating the potential for 
landslides and rockfalls, in turn dislodging Rota blue damselfly eggs 
and naiads from streams, and also displace or destroy vegetation used 
for perching by adults, leaving them more susceptible to predation.</p>

          <p id="p-255" data-page="59461">The threat from fire to 11 of 
the 23 species in this final rule that depend on the savanna ecosystem 
and adjacent forest ecosystems (9 plant species: <em>Bulbophyllum 
guamense, Cycas micronesica, Dendrobium guamense, Hedyotis megalantha, 
Maesa walkeri, Nervilia jacksoniae, Phyllanthus saffordii, 
Tabernaemontana rotensis,</em> and <em>Tuberolabium guamense;</em> and 2
 animal species: The Guam tree snail and the humped tree snail) (see 
Table 3, above) is serious and ongoing because fire damages and destroys
 native vegetation, including dormant seeds, seedlings, and juvenile and
 adult plants. After a fire, nonnative, invasive plants, particularly 
fire-tolerant grasses, outcompete native plants and inhibit their 
regeneration (D'Antonio and Vitousek 1992, pp. 70, 73-74; Tunison <em>et al.</em> 2002, p. 122; Berger <em>et al.</em>
 2005, p. 38; CNMI-SWARS 2010, pp. 7, 20; JGPO-NavFac, Pacific 2010b, p.
 4-33). Successive fires that burn farther and farther into native 
habitat destroy native plants and animals, and remove habitat for native
 species by altering microclimatic conditions and creating conditions 
favorable to alien plants. The threat from fire is unpredictable but 
increasing in frequency in the savanna ecosystem that has been invaded 
by nonnative fire-prone grasses, and that is subject to abnormally dry 
to severe drought conditions.</p>

          <p id="p-256" data-page="59461">Natural disasters, such as 
typhoons, are a threat to native terrestrial habitats on the Mariana 
Islands in all 4 ecosystems addressed here, and to all 14 plant species 
identified in this final rule, because they result in direct impacts to 
ecosystems and individual plants by opening the forest canopy, modifying
 available light, and creating disturbed areas that are conducive to 
invasion by nonnative pest plants (Asner and Goldstein 1997, p. 148; 
Harrington <em>et al.</em> 1997, pp. 346-347; Berger <em>et al.</em> 
2005, pp. 36, 45, 71, 100, 144; CNMI-SWARS 2010, p. 10; JGPO-NavFac, 
Pacific 2010b, pp. 1-8). In addition, typhoons are a threat to the nine 
animal species in this rule because strong winds and intense rainfall 
can kill individual animals, and can cause direct damage to streams 
(Polhemus 1993, pp. 86-87). High winds and torrential rains associated 
with typhoons can also destroy the host plants for the two butterfly 
species, and can dislodge individual butterflies and their larvae from 
their host plants and deposit them on the ground where they may be 
crushed by falling debris or eaten by nonnative wasps and ants. In 
addition, the high winds can dislodge bats from their caves and cause 
individual harm or death. Typhoons pose an ongoing threat because they 
are unpredictable and can occur at any time. Although typhoons are a 
natural occurrence in the Pacific, their impact can be particularly 
devastating to the 23 species because, as a result of other threats, 
they now persist in low numbers or occur in restricted ranges and are, 
therefore, less resilient to such disturbances, rendering them highly 
vulnerable.

          <p id="p-259" data-page="59462">
            <em>Tree Snails—</em> Tree snails can be found around the 
world in tropical and subtropical regions and have been valued as 
collectibles for centuries. Evidence of tree snail trading among 
prehistoric Polynesians was discovered by analysis of the 
multi-archipelagic distribution of the Tahitian endemic <em>Partula hyalina</em> and related taxa (Lee <em>et al.</em> 2007, pp. 2,907, 2,910). In their study, Lee <em>et al.</em> (2007, pp. 2,908-2,910) found evidence that <em>P. hyalina</em>
 had been traded as far away as Mangaia in the Southern Cook Islands, a 
distance of more than 500 mi (805 km). The endemic Hawaiian tree snails 
within the family Achatinellidae were extensively collected for 
scientific as well as recreational purposes by Europeans in the 18th to 
early 20th centuries (Hadfield 1986, p. 322). Historically, tree snails 
were abundant in the Pacific Islands. During the 1800s collectors 
observed 500 to 2,000 snails per tree, and sometimes collected more than
 4,000 snails in several hours (Hadfield 1986, p. 322). Likewise, in the
 Mariana Islands, Crampton (an early naturalist in the islands) alone 
took 2,666 adult humped tree snails from 8 sites on Saipan in just 6 
days in 1925 (Crampton 1925, p. 100). Repeated collections of hundreds 
to thousands of individuals at a time by early collectors may have 
contributed to decreased population sizes and reduction of reproduction 
potential due to the removal of potential breeding adults (Hadfield 
1986, p. 327). The collection of tree snails persists to this day, and 
the market for rare tree snails serves as an incentive to collect them. A
 search of the Internet (<em>e.g.,</em> eBay and Etsy) reveals Web sites
 that offer snail shells from more than 100 land and sea snail species 
(along with corals and sand) from around the world, including rare and 
listed <em>Achatinella</em> and <em>Partulina.</em> These sites 
encourage collectors by making statements such as “These assorted land 
snail shells from the tropical regions of the world are great for 
crafters and decorations for tanks” and refer to shells with colorful 
names such as “rainbow shells from Haiti” (<em><a date="10/01/2015" href="http://www.shells-of-aquarius.com/snail-shells.html">http://www.shells-of-aquarius.com/​snail-shells.html</a></em>; <em><a date="10/01/2015" href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/search?q=tree+snail">https://www.etsy.com/​uk/​search?​q=​tree+​snail</a></em>).
 Concerned citizens alert law enforcement of Internet sales and notify 
the public about illegal sales through personal web blogs (<em><a date="10/01/2015" href="http://bioacoustics.blogspot.com/2012/04/endangered-species-on-ebay.html">http://bioacoustics.blogspot.com/​2012/​04/​endangered-species-on-ebay.html</a></em>).
 Over the past 100 years, Mariana species of partulid tree snail shells 
have been made into jewelry and purses and sold to tourists (Kerr 2013, 
p. 3). As recent as 2012, jewelry made with partulid shells has been 
observed in stores in the Mariana Islands (USFWS 2012, in litt.). Based 
on the history of collection of Pacific island tree snails, the market 
for Mariana tree snail shells, and the vulnerability of the small 
populations of the humped tree snail, Langford's tree snail, the Guam 
tree snail, and the fragile tree snail, we consider collection a threat 
to the four endemic Mariana tree snail species listed as endangered 
species in this rule.</p>

          <p id="p-262" data-page="59462">There are multiple animal 
species, ranging from mammals and rodents to reptiles and insects, 
reported to impact 17 of the 23 species listed as endangered or 
threatened species in this final rule by means of predation or herbivory
 (Table 3). Those species that have the most direct negative impact on 
the 23 species include: Feral pigs, Philippine deer, rats, the brown 
treesnake, monitor lizards, Cuban slugs (<em>Veronicella cubensis</em>), the manokwari flatworm, the cycad aulacaspis scale, ants (<em>Tapinoma minutum, Technomyrmex albipes, Monomorium floricola,</em> and <em>Solenopsis geminata</em>), and parasitoid wasps <em>(Telenomus</em> sp. and <em>Ooencyrtus</em>
 sp.). Data show these nonnative animals have caused a decline of 17 of 
the 23 species (Intoh 1986 in Conry 1988, p. 26; Fritts and Rodda 1998, 
pp. 130-133). Although feral goats, cattle, and water buffalo occur on 
one or more of the Mariana Islands and are recognized to negatively 
impact the ecosystems in which they occur (see “<em>Factor A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range,</em>”
 above), we have no direct evidence that goats, cattle, or water buffalo
 browse specifically on any of the 14 plant species addressed in this 
final rule.</p>

          <p id="p-263" data-page="59462">
            <em>Pigs—</em> Feral pigs are widely recognized to 
negatively alter ecosystems (see “Habitat Destruction and Modification 
by Introduced Ungulates,” above). In addition, feral pigs have been 
observed to eat the leaves, fruits, seeds, seedlings, or bark from 4 of 
the 14 plant species listed as endangered or threatened species in this 
final rule (<em>Cycas micronesica, Heritiera longipetiolata, Psychotria malaspinae,</em> and <em>Solanum guamense</em>) in the forest ecosystem (Perlman and Wood 1994, pp. 135-136; Harrington <em>et al.</em> 2012, in litt.; Rogers 2012, in litt.; Marler 2013, pers. comm.). Similarly, on other Pacific islands (<em>e.g.,</em>
 the Hawaiian Islands), pigs are known to eat and fell plants and remove
 the bark from a variety of native plant species, including <em>Clermontia</em> spp., <em>Cyanea</em> spp., <em>Cyrtandra</em> spp., <em>Hedyotis</em> spp., <em>Psychotria</em> spp., and <em>Scaevola</em> spp. (Diong 1982, p. 144). In addition, evidence of pigs feeding on <em>Cycas micronesica</em> has been observed, hypothesized as a means to obtain grubs <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59463"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59463" data-page="59463" data-text="Start Printed Page 59463" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59463}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59463</span></span></span>(Harrington <em>et al.</em>
 2012, in litt.). Pigs also eat standing living stems of plants, thought
 to be for the same intent (Marler 2013, pers. comm.). Feral pigs have 
been documented to eat the host plants that support the Mariana 
eight-spot butterfly (<em>Procris pendunculata</em> and <em>Elatostema calcareum</em>).</p>

          <p id="p-264" data-page="59463">In addition to deer imposing 
negative impacts on habitat at an ecosystem scale in the Mariana Islands
 on which they occur (primarily Guam and Rota), deer are known to

          <p id="p-265" data-page="59463">
            <em>Rat Predation on Tree Snails—</em> Rats (<em>Rattus</em>
 spp.) have been suggested as responsible for the greatest number of 
animal extinctions on islands throughout the world, including 
extinctions of various snail species (Towns <em>et al.</em> 2006, p. 88). Rats are known to prey upon Pacific island endemic arboreal snails (Hadfield <em>et al.</em> 1993, p. 621). In the Waianae mountains of Oahu, Meyer and Shiels (2009, p. 344) found shells of the endemic Oahu tree snail (<em>Achatinella mustelina</em>) with characteristic rat damage (<em>e.g.,</em>
 damage to the shell opening and cone tip), but noted that, since a high
 proportion of crushed shells could not reliably be collected in the 
field, the impact of rat predation on snail populations may be 
underestimated. Rat predation on tree snails has also been observed on 
the Hawaiian Islands of Lanai (Hobdy 1993, p. 208; Hadfield 2005, in 
litt, p. 4), Molokai (Hadfield and Saufler 2009, p. 1,595), and Maui 
(Hadfield 2006, in litt.). Rat populations on Guam may be limited by 
predation by the brown treesnake, thereby limiting rat predation on 
native tree snails. Because rats occur in larger numbers on the Mariana 
Islands to the north of Guam, rat predation is considered a threat to 
the three tree snail species addressed in this final rule that occur on 
the other Mariana Islands (the humped tree snail on Rota, Aguiguan, 
Saipan, Sarigan, Alamagan, and Pagan; the fragile tree snail on Rota; 
and Langford's tree snail on Aguiguan).</p>

            <em>Rat Predation on Bats—</em> Rats may prey on the Pacific
 sheath-tailed bat, listed as an endangered species in this final rule. 
Rats are omnivores and are opportunistic feeders. Rats have a widely 
varied diet consisting of nuts, seeds, grains, vegetables, fruits, 
insects, worms, snails, eggs, frogs, fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals 
(Fellers 2000, p. 525; GISD 2014, in litt.). Rats occur on Aguiguan, the
 only island on which the Pacific sheath-tailed bat is known to roost 
(Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005, p. 144). Rats are predators on young bats at roosts (that are nonvolant, <em>i.e.,</em> have not yet developed the ability to fly) (Wiles <em>et al.</em>
 2011, p. 306). The black rat was determined to be the primary factor in
 reproductive failure for a maternal colony of Townsend's big-eared bat (<em>Corynorhinus townsendii</em>)
 in California (Fellers 2000, pp. 524-525). Many of the roosting sites 
used by the Pacific sheath-tailed bat on Aguiguan appear to be 
impassable to rats; however, this may be due to rats limiting the 
selection of roosting sites because of their foraging and surveillance 
for prey in caves (Wiles and Worthington 2002, p. 18; Berger <em>et al.</em>
 2005, p. 144). Because rats occur on all of the Mariana Islands, the 
Service considers rats a threat to the Pacific sheath-tailed bat.</p>

            <em>Rat Predation on Skinks—</em> Rats are known to prey on a variety of skink species around the globe (Crook 1973 in Towns <em>et al.</em> 2001, p. 3; Whitaker 1973 in Towns <em>et al.</em> 2001, p. 3; McCallum 1986 in Towns <em>et al.</em> 2001, p. 3; Towns <em>et al.</em> 2001, pp. 3-4, 6-8; Towns <em>et al.</em>
 2006, pp. 875-877, 883). A New Zealand study showed the cause of the 
decline of rare reptiles on island reserves became evident through 
associations with the spread of Pacific rats (<em>Rattus exulans</em>) to these island reserves (Crook, 1973; Whitaker, 1973, 1978; and McCallum, 1986 in Towns <em>et al.</em>
 2001, p. 3). Other restoration projects in New Zealand have 
demonstrated the native reptile populations undergo a resurgence 
following aggressive conservation activities to control predatory 
mammals, especially rodents (Towns <em>et al.</em> 2001, p. 3). The reptile species showing the most rapid response to removal of rats was the shore skink (<em>Oligosoma smithi</em>), with an increase of the capture frequency of shore skinks by up to 3,600 percent over 9 years (Towns 1994, unpub. in Towns <em>et al.</em>
 2001, p. 10). Rats occur on all of the Mariana Islands and are a threat
 to the Slevin's skink on the islands on which it currently occurs 
(Cocos Island, Alamagan, and Sarigan), and are a threat on islands where
 the skink was observed in the 1980s and 1990s (Guguan, Pagan, and 
Asuncion) but for which their current status is unknown. Once thought to
 be extirpated from Cocos Island (just offshore of Guam), Slevin's skink
 was observed on Cocos Island for the first time in more than 20 years 
following the eradication of rats and monitor lizards (Fisher 2012 pers.
 comm., in IUCN 2014, in litt.), indicating that predation by these 
nonnative species has a significant negative effect on skink 
populations.</p>
          <h4 id="h-61">Brown Treesnake</h4>
          <p id="p-268" data-page="59463">The brown treesnake (see 
“Habitat Destruction and Modification by Introduced Small Vertebrates,” 
above) preys upon a wide variety of animals, and although it is only 
known to occur on Guam at this time, it is an enormous concern that the 
brown treesnake will be introduced to other Mariana Islands (The Brown 
Treesnake Control Committee 1996, pp. 1, 5; USFWS-Brown Treesnake 
Strategic Plan 2015, pp. 1-85). This nocturnal arboreal snake occupies 
all ecosystems on Guam, and consumes small mammals and lizards, usually 
in their neonatal state (Rodda and Savidge 2007, pp. 307, 314). The 
brown treesnake is attributed with the extirpation, or contribution 
thereof, of 13 of Guam's 22 native bird species. Roosting and nesting 
birds, eggs, and nestlings are all vulnerable. If the brown treesnake 
establishes on any other of the Mariana Islands it will impose a wide 
range of negative impacts, both environmental and economic (Campbell 
2014, pers. comm.).</p>
          <p id="p-269" data-page="59463">
            <em>Brown Treesnake Predation on Bats—</em> The brown 
treesnake has the potential to prey on fruit bats and the Pacific 
sheath-tailed bat, as brown treesnake are known to climb in caves and 
prey on Mariana swiftlets. Predation by treesnakes possibly caused 
losses of sheath-tailed bats in southern Guam in the 1950s and 1960s, 
but invaded northern Guam too late to have played a role in the bat's 
extirpation there (Wiles <em>et al.</em> 2011, p. 306). If the brown 
treesnake should be introduced to Aguiguan, the only island in the 
Mariana archipelago that currently supports a population of the Pacific 
sheath-tailed bat, it would negatively affect this population, either by
 predation or by limiting available cave sites (Rodda and Savidge 2007, 
p. 307). Additionally, if the BTS is introduced to islands in the 
Mariana archipelago that historically supported the Pacific 
sheath-tailed bat (<em>i.e.,</em> Guam, Rota, Saipan, Tinian, Anatahan, 
and Maug), recovery for this species will be difficult, and the Service 
considers the brown treesnake a potential threat to the Pacific 
sheath-tailed bat on these islands.</p>

Juvenile brown treesnake are known to feed exclusively on lizards 
(including skinks) (Savidge 1988, in Rodda and Savidge 2007, pp. 
314-315). In one study, 250 food items were taken from the digestive 
systems of brown treesnake, and of these, 194 were lizards or lizard 
eggs (Savidge 1988 cited in Rodda and Fritts 1992, p. 166). If the brown
 treesnake is introduced to any of the islands that currently (Cocos 
Island, Alamagan, and Sarigan) or historically (Guam, Rota, Tinian, 
Aguiguan, Guguan, and Pagan) support the Slevin's skink, it will 
negatively impact by decreasing populations and the numbers of 
individuals, and when combined with habitat loss, and other threats, 
could lead to their extirpation. Additionally, if the brown treesnake is
 introduced to islands where the Slevin's skink occurred historically 
(Guam, Rota, Tinian, Aguiguan, Guguan, and Pagan), recovery for this 
species will be difficult, and the Service considers the brown treesnake
 a potential threat to the Slevin's skink on these islands.</p>
          <h4 id="h-62">Monitor Lizard</h4>
          <p id="p-271" data-page="59464">
            <em>Monitor Lizard Predation on Bats—</em> The monitor lizard (hilitai, <em>Varanus indicus</em>),
 a carnivorous, terrestrial, arboreal lizard that can grow up to 3 ft (1
 m) in length, is present on every island in the Mariana Islands except 
for Farallon de Medinilla, Guguan, Asuncion, Maug, and Uracas (Vogt and 
Williams 2004, pp. 76-77). It is unknown when the monitor lizard was 
introduced to Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands; however, it is 
known that the presence of this species in the islands predates European
 contact (Vogt and Williams, p. 77). Monitor lizards typically hunt over
 large areas and feed frequently on a wide variety of prey including, 
but not limited to, crabs, snails, snakes, lizards, skinks, fish, rats, 
squirrels, rabbits, sea turtle eggs, and birds (Losos and Greene 1988, 
pp. 379, 393; Bennet 1995 in ISSG-GISD 2007, in litt.). In the Mariana 
Islands, monitor lizards prey on both invertebrates and vertebrates, 
including large animals like chickens and the endangered Micronesian 
megapode (Martin <em>et al.</em> 2008 in IUCN 2007, in litt.). 
Considering their varied diet, which includes small vertebrates, and 
given the opportunity, predation by monitor lizards is a threat to the 
Pacific sheath-tailed bat listed as an endangered species in this rule, 
in the forest and cave ecosystems (USDA-NRCS 2009, p. 8).</p>
          <p id="p-272" data-page="59464">
            <em>Monitor Lizard Predation on Skinks—</em> Monitor lizards
 are known to prey on all life stages of lizards (eggs, juveniles, and 
adults), and also other monitor lizards; therefore, we expect that 
monitor lizards negatively impact the Slevin's skink as well (Rodda and 
Fritts 1992, pp. 166-174; Vogt 2010, in litt.). The specific reasons for
 the decline of Slevin's skink (currently known from only 3 of the 10 
islands where occurrences have been noted) are not known. Rodda <em>et al.</em>
 (1991) suggest that the combination of introduced species such as rats 
and shrews and other reptiles negatively impact native reptile 
populations, including Slevin's skink, by aggressively competing for 
habitat and food resources, and through predation (see “Rat Predation on
 Skinks,” above) (Rodda <em>et al.</em> 1991 in Berger <em>et al.</em> 
2005, pp. 174-175). The monitor lizard is known to have a varied diet 
(coconut crabs, snails, snakes, lizards, skinks, fish, rats, sea turtle 
eggs, and birds) (Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005, pp. 69-70, 90, 347-348; 
Losos and Greene 1988, pp. 379, 393; Bennet 1995 in ISSG-GISD 2007, in 
litt.; Cota 2008, pp. 18-27); therefore, predation of Slevin's skink by 
monitor lizards is a threat to the Slevin's skink throughout its range 
in the Mariana Islands.</p>
          <h4 id="h-63">Nonnative Fish Predation on Damselflies</h4>

          <p id="p-273" data-page="59464">A survey of the Okgok River 
(or Okgok Stream, also known as Babao), conducted in 1996, showed that 
only four fish species (all native species) were present: The eel <em>Anguila marmorata,</em> the mountain gobies <em>Stiphodon elegans</em> and <em>Sicyopus leprurus,</em> and the flagtail or mountain bass, <em>Kuhlia rupestris.</em> Other freshwater species observed included a prawn, shrimps, and gastropods (Camacho <em>et al.</em>
 1997, pp. 8-9). Densities of these native fish were low, especially in 
areas above the waterfall. Gobies can maneuver in areas of rapidly 
flowing water by using ventral fins that are modified to form a sucking 
disk (Ego 1956, in litt.). Freshwater gobies in Hawaii are primarily 
browsers and bottom feeders, often eating algae off rocks and boulders, 
with midges and worms being their primary food items (Ego 1956, in 
litt.; Kido <em>et al.</em> 1993, p. 47). The flagtails were abundant 
only in the lower reach of the stream. We can only speculate that the 
Rota blue damselfly may have adapted its behavior to avoid the benthic 
feeding habits of native fish species.</p>
          <p id="p-274" data-page="59464">Nonnative fish (<em>Gambusia</em> spp.) were introduced to Guam streams for mosquito control. Other nonnative fish from the aquarium trade (<em>e.g.,</em>
 guppies, swordtails, mollies, betta, oscars, and koi) have been 
released and documented in Guam streams. Currently, none of these fish 
are known from the Okgok River (Okgok Stream, Babao) on Rota, but 
biologists believe that <em>Gambusia</em> and guppies would be the most 
likely species to be introduced (Tibbatts 2014, in litt.). The release 
of aquarium fish into streams and rivers of Guam is well documented, but
 currently, no nonnative fish have been found in the Rota stream 
(Tibbatts 2014, in litt.). Therefore, release of nonnative fish is only a
 potential threat at this time, as they could impact the Rota blue 
damselfly by eating the naiad life stage, interrupting its life-cycle, 
and leading to its extirpation.</p>
          <h4 id="h-64">Nonnative Invertebrates</h4>
          <p id="p-275" data-page="59464">
            <em>Slug Herbivory on Native Plants—</em> The nonnative Cuban slug (<em>Veronicella cubensis</em>)
 is considered one of the greatest threats to native plant species on 
Pacific Islands (Robinson and Hollingsworth 2006, p. 2). The Cuban slug 
is a recent introduction to the Micronesian islands. These terrestrial 
mollusks are generalist feeders, and can attack a wide variety of 
plants, and switch food preferences if potential food plants change 
(Robinson and Hollingsworth 2006, p. 2). Slugs feed on the two host 
plants (<em>Elatostema calcareum</em> and <em>Procris pendunculata</em>)
 that support the Mariana eight-spot butterfly, being listed as 
endangered in this final rule. The Cuban slug has been known on Rota 
since 1996, occurs in large numbers, and is currently a pest to 
agricultural and ornamental crops on the island (Badilles <em>et al.</em> 2010, pp. 2, 4, 8). Some agricultural losses are reported to be as high as 70 percent of the crop (Badilles <em>et al.</em>
 2010, p. 7). In addition, these slugs are known to attack orchids, 
which place all four species of orchids listed as threatened species in 
this final rule (<em>Bulbophyllum guamense, Dendrobium guamense, Nervilia jacksoniae,</em> and <em>Tuberolabium guamense</em>) at risk from slug predation on the islands of Guam and Rota (Badilles <em>et al.</em> 2010, p. 7; Cook 2012, in litt.).</p>

            <em>Flatworm Predation on Tree Snails—</em> The extinction of native land snails on several Pacific Islands has been attributed to the terrestrial manokwari flatworm (<em>Platydemus manokwari;</em>

(Cowie 2001, p. 120; Sugiura and Okochi 2006, p. 700; Sugiura 2010, p.

 in litt.; Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau International (CABI-Invasive
 Species Compendium 2015, in litt.). It is believed to occur on most of 
the southern Mariana Islands, and was first observed on Guam in 1978 
(Hopper and Smith 1992, pp. 78, 82-83; Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005, p. 
158). In many areas, the flatworm was initially introduced intentionally
 for the purpose of controlling the nonnative giant African snail (<em>Achatinella fulica</em>);
 it was found to be effective in reducing the abundance of the giant 
African snail by as much as 95 percent (Hopper and Smith 1992, p. 82). 
This flatworm has diminished numbers of two nonnative predatory snails, 
the rosy wolf snail (<em>Euglandina rosea</em>) and <em>Gonaxis</em> 
spp., both of which are widely recognized as significant contributors to
 the overall decline in tree snails throughout the Pacific (Hadfield 
1986, pp. 325-330; Cowie 1992, p. 171; Hopper and Smith 1992, p. 78; 
Kerr 2013, pp. 5-6). Some snail experts propose that, due to the 
presence of the manokwari flatworm, these two nonnative snails are no 
longer a threat to the Mariana Islands tree snails (Kerr 2013, p. 5). 
However, other snail experts are not so quick to discount the possible 
future impacts of these two predators (Cowie 2014, in litt.). The 
manokwari flatworm is highly invasive and preys on live snails of any 
species (Sugiura <em>et al.</em> 2006, p. 700, and references therein), and thus poses a significant threat to all endemic snails of the Mariana Islands.</p>

          <p id="p-277" data-page="59465">The manokwari flatworm is 
capable of spreading easily to new geographic areas through inadvertent 
introductions and despite agricultural controls and regulations. First 
discovered in New Guinea in 1962, it is now found in Australia, Japan, 
Indonesia, the Caribbean (Puerto Rico), and numerous Pacific Islands (<em>e.g.,</em>
 Fiji, Tahiti, Singapore, Samoa, Philippines), including the Mariana 
Islands. It is known to occur on Guam, Rota, Tinian, Saipan, and 
Aguiguan (Hopper and Smith 1992, p. 77; ISSG-GISD 2015, in litt.). Its 
propensity to spread through inadvertent introduction is illustrated by 
recent discoveries of the manokwari flatworm in both France (Justine <em>et al.</em> 2015, p. 2) and the mainland United States in Florida (Justine <em>et al.</em> 2015, p. 1).</p>

          <p id="p-278" data-page="59465">The manokwari flatworm 
exhibits remarkable fecundity. In laboratory studies, individuals 
reached sexual maturity just 3 weeks after hatching, and the time period
 from copulation to cocoon-laying ranged from 2 to 40 days, at which 
time a single cocoon is produced (Kaneda <em>et al.</em> 1990, p. 526). 
Cocoon-laying usually occurred at 7- to 10-day intervals, with some 
adults over 200 days old still capable of laying (Kaneda <em>et al.</em> 1990, p. 526). Each cocoon produced 3 to 9 juveniles, with a mean number of 5 (Kaneda <em>et al.</em> 1990, p. 526). Adequately fed adults lived up to 2 years, and starved adults lived up to 1 year (Kaneda <em>et al.</em>
 1990, p. 526). Additionally, manokwari flatworms are very fragile and 
may fragment into pieces, with each piece having the potential to 
regenerate into a complete flatworm (Kaneda <em>et al.</em> 1990, p. 526).</p>
          <p id="p-279" data-page="59465">In contrast, partulid snails 
are generally slow-growing, long-lived, and slow-reproducing land snails
 (Cowie 1992, p. 194). Partulids can live up to 5 years and reach 
maturity at approximately 1 year, or a little less, in age (Murray and 
Clark 1966 pp. 1,264-1,277; Cowie 1992, p. 174). Partulids produce their
 first offspring between 16 and 24 months of age, and give birth to a 
single juvenile on average about every 20 days thereafter (Murray and 
Clark 1966 pp. 1,264-1,277; Cowie 1992, p. 174). These differences in 
life-history characteristics place the endemic partulid snails at a 
disadvantage, as the predatory manokwari flatworm can quickly reproduce 
in large numbers and overwhelm the small numbers of remaining tree 
snails.</p>

          <p id="p-280" data-page="59465">The manokwari flatworm can be 
found on the ground as well as meters up in native trees and is more 
active during rain events (Hopper 2014, in litt.). This flatworm is 
known to feed on juvenile and adult partulid snails (Hopper and Smith 
1992, p. 82; Iwai <em>et al.</em> 2010, pp. 997-1,002; Sugiura 2010, pp.
 1,499-1,507; Hopper 2014, in litt.). Studies of captive partulids at 
the UOG Marine Laboratory showed that a single manokwari flatworm 
consume four to five adult snails over a single week, averaging one 
killed and consumed every other day (Hopper 2014, in litt.). The 
manokwari flatworm is able to track snails based on chemical cues in 
their mucus trails, and can discriminate between, and show a preference 
for, particular snail species (Iwai <em>et al.</em> 2010, p. 1,000). 
Controlled experiments in the Ogasawara Islands demonstrated flatworm 
predation on 50 percent of the snails available in the test area within 3
 days, and 90 percent snail mortality due to predation within 11 days 
(Sugiura <em>et al.</em> 2006, p. 702). The manokwari flatworm is 
considered a highly effective predator on Mariana Partulidae, of all age
 classes, and likely all other native and nonnative terrestrial snails 
(Hopper 2014, in litt.). Hopper (2014, in litt.) asserts that the 
manokwari flatworm is the most important threat to tree snails since it 
occurs in native forests as well as nonnative and disturbed forest. 
Fiedler (2014, in litt.) describes tree snails on Guam as occurring in 
proximity to sources of fresh water (river, ponds, or near surface 
ground water) and high humidity, which are also conditions ideal for the
 predatory manokwari flatworm, and notes that the flatworm has been 
observed at nearly every location where partulid snails occur on Guam.</p>
          <p id="p-281" data-page="59465">There are no known natural 
enemies of the manokwari flatworm, and no biological controls that would
 not also kill the four tree snails. One exception is that hot water has
 been suggested as a physical control, after laboratory studies showed 
that the temperature of water required to kill flatworms (109 
°Fahrenheit (F) (43 °Celsius (C))) is lower than the temperature to kill
 snails (122 °F (50 °C)) (Sugiura 2008, p. 207); however, we are unaware
 of this method being implemented in the field. This method is employed 
during the quarantine of ornamental plants in some areas (Sugiura 2008, 
p. 207). It is unknown if the temperature that kills flatworms may harm 
the reproductive or other necessary biological functions of snails, even
 though it does not kill them.</p>

          <p id="p-282" data-page="59465">In summary, the manokwari 
flatworm's arboreal habits, voracious appetite, and high fecundity make 
this predator a very harmful invasive species (GISD-ISSG 2010, in 
litt.). The IUCN Invasive Species Specialist Group has named the 
manokwari flatworm to its list of <em>100 of the World's Worst Invasive Alien Species</em>
 (ISSG 2004, pp. 6-7). As referenced above, the manokwari flatworm is 
already credited with the extinction of several island endemic snail 
species. Due to its widespread occurrence on the southern Mariana 
Islands, and the risk of unintentional introduction on the northern 
Mariana Islands, predation by the manokwari flatworm is considered a 
threat to all four tree snail species (the Guam tree snail, the humped 
tree snail, Langford's tree snail, and the fragile tree snail) listed as
 endangered species in this final rule. These four snails are also 
experiencing habitat loss due to development, habitat degradation by 
nonnative plants and animals, predation by rats, and threats associated 
with low heterozygosity. As populations of the tree snails have been 
reduced in both number and distribution, they are also vulnerable to 
negative impacts resulting from future climate change and typhoons.</p>

            <em>Scale Herbivory on Cycas—Cycas micronesica</em> is currently declining on two (Guam and Rota) of the five Micronesian islands on which it occurs <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59466"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59466" data-page="59466" data-text="Start Printed Page 59466" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59466}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59466</span></span></span>due to the presence of a phytophagous (plant-eating) insect, the cycad aulacaspis scale (<em>Aulacaspis yasumatsui</em>)
 (Marler and Lawrence 2012, pp. 238-240; Marler 2012, pers. comm.). The 
cycad aulacaspis scale, first described in Thailand (Takagi 1977 in 
Marler and Lawrence 2012, p. 233), was unintentionally introduced into 
the United States (Florida) a little more than 20 years ago (Howard <em>et al.</em>
 1999 in Marler and Lawrence 2012, p. 233), subsequently spreading to 
other regions. It was introduced to Guam in 2003, possibly via 
importation of the landscape cycad, <em>Cycas revoluta</em> (Marler and 
Lawrence 2012, p. 233). By 2005, the cycad aulacaspis scale had spread 
throughout the forests of Guam. Although this scale has infested <em>C. micronesica</em>
 populations on Guam, Rota, and the larger islands of Palau, most of the
 data has been collected on Guam, where more than 50 percent of the 
total known <em>Cycas</em> individuals occur (Marler 2012, pers. comm.). In 2002, prior to the scale infestation, <em>C. micronesica</em> was the most abundant tree species on Guam (Donnegan <em>et al.</em>
 2002, p. 16). At an international meeting of the Cycad Specialist Group
 in Mexico in 2005, the cycad aulacaspis scale was identified as a 
critical issue for cycad conservation worldwide and was given priority 
status (IUCN/Species Survival Commission Cycad Specialist Group 2014, in
 litt.).</p>

          <p id="p-284" data-page="59466">The cycad aulacaspis scale 
attacks every part of the leaf, which subsequently turns white. The leaf
 then collapses, and with progressive infestation, death of the entire 
plant can occur in less than 1 year (Marler and Muniappan 2006, pp. 
3-4). Field studies conducted on the Guam National Wildlife Refuge on 
Guam by Marler and Lawrence (2012, p. 233) between 2004 and 2011 found 
that 6 years after the cycad aulacaspis scale was found on the refuge, 
mortality of <em>C. micronesica</em> there had reached 92 percent. The 
scale first killed all seedlings at their study site, followed by the 
juveniles, then most of the adult plants. The cycad aulacaspis scale is 
unusual in that it also infests the roots of its host plant at depths of
 up to 24 in (60 cm) in the soil (University of Florida 2014, in litt.).
 Marler and Lawrence (2012, pp. 238, 240) predict that if the predation 
by cycad aulacaspis scale is unabated, it will cause the extirpation of <em>C. micronesica</em> from western Guam by 2019.</p>

          <p id="p-285" data-page="59466">Nonnative specialist 
arthropods like the cycad aulacaspis scale are particularly harmful to 
native plants when introduced to small insular oceanic islands because 
the native plants lack the shared evolutionary history with arthropods 
and have not developed resistance mechanisms (Elton 1958 in Marler and 
Lawrence 2012, p. 233), and the nonnative arthropods are not constrained
 by the natural pressures or predators of their native range (Howard <em>et al.</em> 1999, p. 26; Keane and Crawely 2002 in Marler and Lawrence 2012, p. 233). In addition, <em>C. micronesica</em>
 is the sole native host of the cycad aulacaspis scale on Guam, which 
raises concerns to biologists who predict that the extirpation of <em>C. micronesica</em>
 from Guam will bring about negative cascading ecosystem responses and 
manifold ecological changes (Marler and Lawrence 2012, p. 233). Because 
this scale spread to Rota in 2006 (Moore <em>et al.</em> 2006, in 
litt.), and the larger islands of Palau in 2008 (Marler in Science Daily
 2012, in litt.), the same degree of negative impact to <em>C. micronesica</em> in these areas is likely to occur.</p>

          <p id="p-286" data-page="59466">As shown in other case studies
 worldwide, the scale insects are known to spread rapidly, within a few 
months, from the site of introduction (University of Florida 2014, in 
litt.). Although the scale is present on the larger islands of Palau, it
 has not yet reached the numerous smaller Rock Islands, where more than 
1,000 individuals of <em>C. micronesica</em> are estimated to occur. As 
scales can be wind dispersed, it could be a short amount time for 
infestation in the Rock Islands, as shown by its rapid spread throughout
 Florida between 1996 and 1998 (Marler 2014, in litt.; University of 
Florida 2014, in litt). The Rock Islands are a popular tourist 
destination, and the scale could also be inadvertently transported on 
plant material and soils (International Coral Reef Action Network 
(ICRAN) 2014, in litt.). Yap is an intermediate stop-over point for 
those traveling between Guam and Palau. <em>Cycas micronesica</em> on 
Yap are also considered at risk as scales can be spread by wind 
dispersal and on transportation of already infested plant material and 
soil; and because of the rapidity with which it spreads (ISSG-GISD 2014,
 in litt.; University of Florida 2014, in litt.). In addition, three 
other insects (a nonnative butterfly (<em>Chilades pandava</em>), a nonnative leaf miner (<em>Erechthias</em> sp.), and a native stem borer (<em>Dihammus marianarum</em>), opportunistically feed on <em>C. micronesica</em> weakened by the cycad aulacaspis scale, compounding its negative impacts (Marler 2013, pp. 1,334-1,336).</p>

          <p id="p-287" data-page="59466">Scales, once established, 
require persistent control efforts (Gill 2012, in litt.; University of 
Florida 2014, in litt.). Within the native range of the scale in 
southeast Asia, cycads are not affected, as the scale is kept in check 
by native predators; however, there are no predators of the scale in 
areas where it is newly introduced (Howard <em>et al.</em> 1999, p. 15). Release of biocontrols has been attempted to abate the scale infestation; however, these were unsuccessful: <em>Rhyzobius lophanthae</em> in 2004, which established immediately; <em>Coccobius fulvus</em> in 2005, which did not establish; and <em>Aphytis lignanensis</em> in 2012, which died in the laboratory prior to release (Moore <em>et al.</em> 2006, in litt.). <em>Rhyzobius lophanthae</em> prolonged the survival of many <em>Cycas</em> trees during the first 6 years of scale infestation; however, with time, the size difference between the scale and <em>R. lophanthae</em> proved to be a problem when it was observed that the scale could find locations on the <em>Cycas</em> plant body that the predator (<em>R. lophanthae</em>) could not access (Marler and Moore 2010, p. 838). Even with this biocontrol, <em>Cycas micronesica</em> populations are still declining and no reproduction has been observed on Guam since 2005 (Moore <em>et al.</em> 2006, in litt.).</p>
          <p id="p-288" data-page="59466">
            <em>Ant Predation on Butterflies—</em> Four species of 
nonnative ants have been observed to prey upon the Mariana eight-spot 
butterfly (Schreiner and Nafus 1996, p. 3), and are believed to also 
negatively impact the Mariana wandering butterfly, the two butterfly 
species listed as endangered species in this final rule: (1) Dwarf 
pedicel ants (<em>Tapinoma minutum</em>); (2) tropical fire ants (<em>Solenopsis geminata</em>); (3) white-footed ants (<em>Technomyrmex albipes</em>); and (4) bi-colored trailing ants (<em>Monomorium floricola</em>).
 These ants eat the butterfly eggs (Schreiner and Nafus 1996, p. 3; 
Rubinoff 2014, in litt.). Many ant species are known to prey on all 
immature stages of Lepidoptera and can completely exterminate 
populations (Zimmerman 1958). In a 1-year study, Schreiner and Nafus 
(1996, pp. 3-4) found predation by nonnative ants to be one of the 
primary causes of mortality (more than 90 percent) in the Mariana 
eight-spot butterfly. These four ant species occur on the islands of 
Guam, Rota, and Saipan, which support the two butterfly species. 
Biologists observed high mortality of the instar larval stages of the 
Mariana eight-spot butterfly (Schreiner and Nafus 1996, pp. 2-4), for 
unknown reasons, but this, compounded with predation of eggs by ants, 
negatively impacts both the Mariana eight-spot butterfly and the Mariana
 wandering butterfly.</p>

 wandering butterfly (Guam and Rota) (Schreiner and Nafus 1996, pp. 
2-5). These wasps are tiny and likely hitch-hiked with adult female 
butterflies in order to access freshly laid eggs, as has been observed 
in related species (Woelke 2008, pp. 1-27). These wasps negatively 
impact the Mariana eight-spot and Mariana wandering butterflies because 
they lay their own eggs within the butterfly eggs, thus preventing 
caterpillar development. Habitat destruction and loss of host plants, 
along with continued parasitism, act together to negatively affect 
populations and individuals of the Mariana eight-spot butterfly and the 
Mariana wandering butterfly. These parasitoid wasps occur on the three 
islands (Guam, Rota, and Saipan) that support the Mariana eight-spot 
butterfly and the Mariana wandering butterfly listed as endangered 
species in this final rule.</p>

          <p id="p-290" data-page="59467">Conservation efforts to reduce predation are the same as those mentioned under Factor A. <em>Habitat Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Range</em>
 (see “Conservation Efforts to Reduce Habitat Destruction, Modification,
 or Curtailment of Its Range,” above). Additionally, there have been 
five fenced 1-ac (0.5-ha) exclosures erected on Tinian as of 2013, each 
planted with 1,000 individuals of mature <em>Cycas micronesica</em> (DON
 2014, in litt.). Precautions were taken to ensure plantings had broad 
genetic representation. Cycads within these exclosures actively managed 
to ensure health and survival. Funding has been programmed to support 
this project through 2020. Tinian was selected for these exclosures 
since the scale does not occur on this island.</p>
          <h4 id="h-66">Summary of Disease and Predation</h4>
          <p id="p-291" data-page="59467">We are unaware of any information that indicates that disease is a threat to any of the 23 species addressed in this final rule.</p>
          <p id="p-292" data-page="59467">Although conservation measures
 are in place in some areas where one or more of the 23 Mariana Islands 
species occurs, our information does not indicate that they are 
ameliorating the threat of predation described above. Therefore, we 
consider predation and herbivory by nonnative animal species (pigs, 
deer, rats, brown treesnakes, monitor lizards, slugs, flatworms, ants, 
and wasps) to pose an ongoing threat to 17 of 23 species addressed in 
this final rule (see Table 3, above) throughout their ranges for the 
following reasons:</p>

          <p id="p-293" data-page="59467">(1) Observations and reports have documented that pigs and deer browse and trample 5 of the 23 plant species (<em>Cycas micronesica, Eugenia bryanii, Heritiera longipetiolata, Psychotria malaspinae,</em> and <em>Solanum guamense</em>),
 and the host plants of the Mariana eight-spot butterfly, addressed in 
this rule (see Table 3), in addition to studies demonstrating the 
negative impacts of ungulate browsing and trampling on native plant 
species of the islands (Spatz and Mueller-Dombois 1973, p. 874; Diong 
1982, pp. 160-161; Cuddihy and Stone 1990, p. 67).</p>
          <p id="p-294" data-page="59467">(2) Nonnative rats, snakes, 
flatworms, and monitor lizards prey upon one or more of the following 
six animal species addressed in this final rule: The Pacific 
sheath-tailed bat, Slevin's skink, and the four tree snails.</p>
          <p id="p-295" data-page="59467">(3) Ants and wasps prey upon 
the eggs and larvae of the two butterflies, the Mariana eight-spot 
butterfly and Mariana wandering butterfly.</p>

          <p id="p-296" data-page="59467">(4) Nonnative slugs cause 
mechanical damage to plants and destruction of plant parts (branches, 
fruits, and seeds), including orchids, and are considered a threat to 4 
of the 14 plant species in this rule (<em>Bulbophyllum guamense, Dendrobium guamense, Nervilia jacksoniae,</em> and <em>Tuberolabium guamense</em>).</p>
          <p id="p-297" data-page="59467">(5) <em>Cycas micronesica</em>
 is currently preyed upon by the cycad aulacaspis scale on three of the 
five Micronesian islands (Guam, Rota, and Palau) on which it occurs 
(Hill <em>et al.</em> 2004, pp. 274-298; Marler and Lawrence 2012, p. 
233; Marler 2012, pers. comm.). This scale has the ability to severely 
impact or even extirpate <em>C. micronesica</em> throughout its range if not abated.</p>
          <p id="p-298" data-page="59467">These threats are serious and 
ongoing, act in concert with other threats to the species and their 
habitats, and are expected to continue or increase in magnitude and 
intensity into the future without effective management actions to 
control or eradicate them.</p>

          <p id="p-299" data-page="59467">The Mariana Islands encompass 
two different political entities, the U.S. Territory of Guam and the 
U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and issues regarding 
existing regulatory measures for each entity are discussed in separate 
paragraphs below.</p>
          <h4 id="h-68">U.S. Territory of Guam</h4>

          <p id="p-300" data-page="59467">We are aware of regulatory 
measures regarding conservation of natural resources established by the 
Government of Guam. Under Guam Annotated Rules (GAR) Title 9-Animal 
Regulations (9 GAR-Animal Regulations), there are two divisions: (1) 
Division 1: Care and Conservation of Animals, and (2) Division 2: 
Conservation, Hunting and Fishing Regulations (<em><a date="10/01/2015" href="http://www.guamcourts.com/">www.guamcourts.com</a></em>,
 accessed February 9, 2014). Division 1 addresses the importation of 
animals, animal and zoonotic disease control, commercial quarantine 
regulations, and plant and non-domestic animal quarantine; however, 
there is no documentation as to what extent this regulation is enforced.
 Division 2 Chapter 63 covers fish, game, forestry, and conservation. 
Article 2 (sections 63201 through 63208) describe authorities under the 
Endangered Species Act of Guam (Guam ESA). This Article vests regulatory
 power in the Guam Department of Agriculture. The Guam ESA prohibits, 
with respect to any threatened or endangered species of plants or 
wildlife of Guam and the United States: (1) Import or export of any such
 species to or from Guam and its territory; (2) take of any such species
 within Guam and its territory; (3) possession, processing, selling or 
offering for sale, delivery, carrying, transport, or shipping, by any 
means whatsoever, any such species; provided that any person who has in 
his possession such plants or wildlife at the time this provision is 
enacted into law, may retain, process, or otherwise dispose of those 
plants or wildlife already in his possession, and (4) violation of any 
regulation or rule pertaining to the conservation, protections, 
enhancement, or management of any designated threatened or endangered 
species.</p>

          <p id="p-301" data-page="59467">As of 2009 (the currently posted list), Guam DAWR recognizes 6 of the 23 species as endangered (the plant <em>Heritiera longipetiolata;</em>
 3 of the 4 tree snails (the Guam tree snail, the humped tree snail, and
 the fragile tree snail), the Pacific sheath-tailed bat, and Slevin's 
skink). The other 17 species on Guam listed as threatened or endangered 
species in this final rule will be recognized as such and protected by 
Guam DAWR under the Endangered Species Act of Guam, as required by the 
Act, upon the publication of this final listing rule. However, Guam's 
ESA does not address the threats imposed upon the 21 species that occur 
currently or historically on Guam that are ongoing and are expected to 
increase in magnitude in the near future (Langford's tree snail and the 
Rota blue damselfly are the only species addressed in this rule with no 
record of occurrence on Guam). Only three species addressed in this

 as discussed in “Conservation Efforts to Reduce Habitat Destruction, 
Modification, or Curtailment of Its Range,” above. Under Guam's ESA, the
 Department of Agriculture is authorized to establish priorities for the
 conservation and protection of threatened and endangered species and 
their associated ecosystems, but we are unaware of any documentation of 
these priorities or actions conducted for protection of the 21 Guam 
species. If comprehensive conservation and protection actions are 
implemented for the 21 Guam species and their associated ecosystems, it 
would greatly reduce the inadequacies outlined above; however, the high 
costs associated with curbing problematic nonnative species often 
precludes the adequate implementation of such actions to fully address 
the threats to listed species.</p>

          <p id="p-302" data-page="59468">The capacity of Guam to mitigate the effects of introduced pests (<em>e.g.,</em>
 brown treesnakes, ungulates, and weeds) is also limited due to the 
large number of taxa currently causing damage. Resources available to 
reduce the spread of these species and counter their negative ecological
 effects are sparse. Despite the fact that Guam receives assistance from
 the USDA, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and other Federal 
agencies, the scope of threats remains challenging. Due to the magnitude
 and intensity of threats associated with the introduction of harmful 
nonnative species in the Marianas (<em>e.g.,</em> brown treesnakes, cycad aulacaspis scale, and the nonnative plant <em>Chromolaena odorata</em>),
 the fact that both new and established introduced species continue to 
pose a significant problem in Guam leads us to conclude that current 
regulatory mechanisms are inadequate to address such threats.</p>

species at risk from competition and predation by nonnative, and in some
 cases native, species. However, these regulations are difficult to 
enforce due to lack of funding availability and human resources 
(CNMI-DLNR-Rota 2015, in litt.).</p>

          <p id="p-305" data-page="59468">Further, the capacity of the CNMI to mitigate the effects of introduced pests (<em>e.g.,</em>
 nonnative ungulates, brown treesnakes, weeds, and predatory flatworms) 
is also limited due to the large number of taxa currently causing 
damage. Resources available to reduce the spread of these species and 
counter their negative ecological effects are sparce. Despite the fact 
that CNMI receives assistance from the USDA, U.S. Department of Homeland
 Security, and other Federal agencies, the scope of threats remains 
challenging. Due to the magnitude and intensity of threats associated 
with the introduction of harmful nonnative species in the Marianas (<em>e.g.,</em>
 brown treesnakes, cycad aulacaspis scale, and predatory flatworms) 
poses a significant threat to the native species of the Marianas; the 
fact that both new and established introduced species continue to pose a
 significant problem in the CNMI leads us to conclude that current 
regulatory mechanisms are inadequate to address such threats.</p>

          <p id="p-306" data-page="59468">Greater enforcement of local 
laws in place would provide additional benefit to the 16 species listed 
as endangered or threatened species in this final rule that occur in the
 CNMI (the plants <em>Bulbophyllum guamense, Cycas micronesica, 
Dendrobium guamense, Heritiera longipetiolata, Maesa walkeri, Nervilia 
jacksoniae, Tabernaemontana rotensis,</em> and <em>Tuberolabium guamense;</em>
 the humped tree snail, Langford's tree snail, and the fragile tree 
snail; the two butterflies, the Pacific sheath-tailed bat, Slevin's 
skink, and the Rota blue damselfly). However, the magnitude and 
intensity of threats, combined with the high costs associated with 
curbing problematic nonnative species and the lack of funding and human 
resources to implement regulations, preclude the ability of regulatory 
actions to fully address the threats to listed species, thus rendering 
current regulatory mechanisms inadequate to protect the 16 CNMI species 
in this final rule.</p>

          <p id="p-307" data-page="59468">The Sikes Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=16&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=670&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">16 U.S.C. 670</a>)
 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to develop cooperative plans with 
the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior for natural resources on
 public lands. The Sikes Act Improvement Act of 1997 requires Department
 of Defense installations, in cooperation with the Service and the State
 fish and wildlife agency, to prepare Integrated Natural Resources 
Management Plans (INRMPs) that provide for the conservation and 
rehabilitation of natural resources on military lands consistent with 
the use of military installations to ensure the readiness of the Armed 
Forces. The Sikes Act states that the INRMP is to reflect the mutual 
agreement of the parties concerning conservation, protection, and 
management of fish and wildlife resources. DOD guidance states that 
mutual agreement should be the goal for the entire plan, and requires 
agreement of the Service with respect to those elements of the plan that
 are subject to other applicable legal authority of the Service such as 
the Endangered Species Act.</p>

          <p id="p-308" data-page="59468">In December 2013, the Department of the Navy, JRM, completed an Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59469"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59469" data-page="59469" data-text="Start Printed Page 59469" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59469}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59469</span></span></span>(INRMP)
 to address the conservation, protection, and management of fish and 
wildlife resources on DOD-managed and -controlled areas on Guam, 
specifically Naval Base Guam and Andersen Air Force Base, including 
leased lands in the CNMI on Tinian and Farallon de Medinilla. On July 2,
 2013, the Navy requested the Service's endorsement of the JRM INRMP. 
The JRM INRMP is under review by the Service, but at present the Navy is
 operating under an INRMP that has not been agreed to by the Service. 
The Service's primary concerns include the need to increase efficiency 
regarding coordination with Federal and State partners, implement 
recovery efforts for extirpated endemic species (several of which exist 
only in captive-breeding programs), implement large-scale control and 
eradication of brown treesnakes, increase protected lands (<em>e.g.,</em>
 conservation areas) in order to recover endangered and threatened 
species, implement ungulate control, and increase conservation actions 
on Tinian and Farallon de Medinilla. The Service is continuing to work 
with the Navy on the development of their INRMP for DOD lands in this 
region.</p>
          <p id="p-309" data-page="59469">At this time, the actions 
outlined in the INRMP do not alleviate the threats to the species 
addressed in this final rule that occur on DOD lands as the most current
 draft of the INRMP (December 2013) predates the publication of the 
proposed rule (October 1, 2014). The December 2013 INRMP (U.S. Navy 
2013, p. ES-2) states that “Several non-candidate Marianas species are 
also being considered for evaluation for inclusion in the proposed 
rules. Once the USFWS determines which species will be included in the 
proposed rules, JRM will develop a supplemental document for inclusion 
in the JRM INRMP for those species with the potential to be on Navy 
lands. The supplemental document will also include information on the 
known status of each species and will identify projects to be undertaken
 on JRM lands to manage the long-term conservation of the species.” The 
Service has not received the supplemental document to make a 
determination of whether or not the proposed actions will alleviate the 
threats to the species in this final rule that occur on DOD lands.</p>
          <h4 id="h-71">Multijurisdictional Regulatory Mechanisms</h4>

          <p id="p-310" data-page="59469">The task of preventing the 
spread of deleterious nonnative species requires multijurisdictional 
efforts. The brown treesnake (BTS) technical working group (comprising 
agencies within the U.S. Department of the Interior (<em>e.g.,</em> USFWS, U.S. Geological Survey, National Park Service), DOD (<em>e.g.,</em>
 JRM and NavFac Pacific), Department of Transportation (DOT), U.S. 
Territory of Guam, CNMI, State of Hawaii, and other nongovernmental 
partners) designs and implements actions to address the regulatory 
mechanisms currently in place (<em>e.g.,</em> CNMI: Administrative Code 
Chapter 85-20 and Chapter 85-60; Guam: 9 GAR-Animal Regulations, 
Division 1: And U.S. Executive Orders 13112 and 13112) to prevent 
inadvertent transport of deleterious species (<em>e.g.,</em> brown 
treesnakes) into Guam and the Mariana Islands, and from Guam to other 
areas, which are important efforts that provide some benefits to all 23 
species. However, these efforts are not sufficient to eliminate the 
continuing threats associated with the brown treesnake in the Marianas. 
For example, in 2014, a brown treesnake was captured at the sea port on 
Rota (BTS Strategic Plan 2015, p. iii), as described above under Factor 
C. Additionally, the BTS Strategic Plan, authored by the BTS technical 
working group, states that “current snake management strategies have 
been successful in decreasing, but not eliminating, the probability of 
snakes becoming established on other islands (BTS Strategic Plan 2015, 
p. iii).”</p>
          <h4 id="h-72">Summary of the Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms</h4>
          <p id="p-311" data-page="59469">Both the U.S. Territory of 
Guam and the U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands have 
regulations in place designed to provide protection for their respective
 natural resources, including native forests, water resources, and the 
23 species addressed in this rule; however, enforcement of these 
regulations is not documented. Greater enforcement of local laws in 
place would provide additional benefit to the 23 species; however, the 
magnitude and intensity of threats, the high costs associated with 
curbing problematic nonnative species, and the lack of funding and human
 resources to implement such regulations preclude the ability of current
 regulatory mechanisms to fully address the threats to the 23 species in
 this final rule. The conservation actions proposed in the 2013 INRMP do
 not address the 23 Mariana Islands species in this final rule, as the 
INRMP predates the proposed listing rule (October 2014). The JRM is 
currently drafting a supplement that will address the threats imposed 
upon the 23 species that occur on DOD lands; however, the Service has 
not yet received this document. The multi-agency BTS technical working 
group aims to prevent inadvertent transport of deleterious species (the 
brown treesnake) into Guam and the Mariana Islands, and from Guam to 
other areas, and although these efforts are important and provide some 
benefits to all 23 species, they are not sufficient to eliminate the 
continuing threats associated with the brown treesnake in the Marianas.</p>
          <h3 id="h-73">Factor E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Their Continued Existence</h3>
          <p id="p-312" data-page="59469">Other factors that pose 
threats to some or all of the 23 species include ordnance and live-fire 
training, water extraction, recreational off-road vehicles, and small 
numbers of populations and small population sizes. Each threat is 
discussed in detail below, along with identification of which species 
are affected by these threats.</p>
          <h4 id="h-74">Ordnance and Live-Fire Training</h4>
          <p id="p-313" data-page="59469">Several individuals of the plants <em>Cycas micronesica, Psychotria malaspinae,</em> and <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis,</em>
 and the Mariana eight-spot butterfly, listed as threatened or 
endangered species in this rule, are located on the Northwest Field of 
Andersen AFB and the Guam National Wildlife Refuge within the boundaries
 of the preferred site for a new live-fire training range complex 
proposed in the 2015 Final SEIS for the Guam and CNMI Military 
Relocation (JGPO-NavFac, Pacific 2015, pp. ES-1—ES-40). This live-fire 
training range complex will consist of 5 live-fire training ranges and 
associated range control facilities and access roads (JGPO-NavFac, 
Pacific 2014, p. ES-5; JGPO-NavFac, Pacific 2015, pp. ES-5, ES-11). Once
 developed, military training is expected to be conducted within the 5 
live-fire training ranges (including a multipurpose machine gun range), 
for 39 weeks out of the year, with 2 night-trainings per week 
(JGPO-NavFac, Pacific 2014, pp. ES-1, ES-5, and Figure 2.5-6). Depending
 on the type of ammunition used, there could be substantial damage to 
vegetation, or a possible fire started from ordnance use, which could 
destroy individuals of <em>Cycas micronesica, Psychotria malaspinae,</em> and <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis,</em> and the Mariana eight-spot butterfly, and their habitat.</p>

          <p id="p-314" data-page="59469">Live-fire training is also 
proposed for the entire northern half of Pagan and on northern Tinian 
(see “Historical and Ongoing Human Impacts,” above (CJMT Draft EIS-OEIS <em><a date="10/01/2015" href="http://www.cnmijointmilitarytrainingeis.com/about">http://www.cnmijointmilitarytrainingeis.com/​about</a></em>).
 Similarly, as described above, ordnance and live-fire training are a 
threat to the species addressed in this rule that occur on Tinian (<em>Heritiera longipetiolata</em> and <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59470"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59470" data-page="59470" data-text="Start Printed Page 59470" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59470}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59470</span></span></span>the
 humped tree snail) and Pagan (humped tree snail and Slevin's skink). 
Additionally, we believe there may be a small population of <em>Cycas micronesica</em>
 on Pagan; however, this is not yet confirmed. Direct damage to 
individuals from live-fire and ordnance has already been documented in 
the past for the plants <em>Cycas micronesica</em> and <em>Heritiera longipetiolata</em>
 along the Tarague ridgeline (GDAWR 2013, in litt.). On the Tarague 
ridgeline near an existing firing range on Andersen AFB, ricochet 
bullets and ordnance have broken branches and made holes through parts 
of <em>Cycas micronesica</em> and <em>Heritiera longipetiolata</em> 
trees, causing added stress and a possible avenue for disease (Guam DAWR
 2013, pers. comm.). Although there is a buffer zone at the end of this 
firing range, there is not a buffer zone on either side, thus increasing
 the risk of damage to nearby forests. In 2014, DON biologists conducted
 a site visit to the Tarague ridgeline and reported they were unable to 
detect any damage to the individuals of <em>C. micronesica</em> and <em>H. longipetiolata</em>
 present in this area, concluding the trees must have healed from their 
wounds (DON 2014, in litt.). We consider ordnance and live-fire training
 a direct threat to individuals of the plants <em>Cycas micronesica, Heritiera longipetiolata,</em>
            <em>Psychotria malaspinae,</em> and <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis;</em>
 and to the humped tree snail, Mariana eight-spot butterfly, and 
Slevin's skink. Additionally, we consider ordnance and live-fire a 
threat to these species due to the associated risk from fires caused by 
ordnance and live-fire training.</p>
          <h4 id="h-75">Water Extraction</h4>

          <p id="p-315" data-page="59470">The Rota blue damselfly was 
only first discovered in April 1996, outside the Talakhaya Water Cave 
(also known as Sonson Water Cave) located below the Sabana plateau on 
the island of Rota (see the species' description, above) (Polhemus <em>et al.</em> 2000, pp. 1-8; Camacho <em>et al.</em>
 1997, p. 4). The Talakhaya Water Cave, As Onon Spring, and the 
perennial stream formed from runoff from the springs at the Water Cave 
support the only known population of the Rota blue damselfly. Rota's 
municipal water is obtained by gravity flow from these two springs (up 
to 1.8 Mgal/day) (Keel <em>et al.</em> 2007, pp. 1, 5; Stafford <em>et al.</em>
 2002, p. 17). Under ordinary climatic conditions, this area supplies 
water in excess of demand but El Niño-Southern Oscillation 
(ENSO)-induced drought conditions can lead to significantly reduced 
discharge, or may completely dewater the streams (Keel <em>et al.</em> 
2007, pp. 3, 6, 19). In 1998, water captured from the springs was 
inadequate for municipal use, and water rationing was instituted (Keel <em>et al.</em>
 2007, p. 6). As the annual temperature rises resulting from global 
climate change, other weather regime changes such as increases in 
droughts, floods, and typhoons will occur (Giambelluca <em>et al.</em> 
1991, p. iii). Increasing night temperatures cause a change in mean 
precipitation, with increased occurrences of drought cycles (Loope and 
Giambelluca 1998, pp. 514-515; Emanuel <em>et al.</em> 2008, p. 365; U.S. Global Change Research Program (US-GCRP) 2009, pp. 145-149, 153; Keener <em>et al.</em> 2010, pp. 25-28; Finucane <em>et al.</em> 2012, pp. 23-26; Keener <em> et al.</em>
 2012, pp. 47-51). The limestone substrate of Rota is porous, with 
filtration through the central Sabana being the sole water source for 
the few streams on the island and for human use. There are no other 
groundwater supplies on the island, and storage capacity is limited. The
 Rota blue damselfly is dependent upon any water that escapes the 
Talakhaya Springs naturally, beyond what has not already been removed 
for human use.</p>
          <p id="p-316" data-page="59470">The likelihood of dewatering 
of the Talakhaya Springs is high due to climate change causing increased
 ENSO conditions, and increased human demand. The “Public and Agency 
Participation” section of the Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation 
Strategy for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (2005, p. 
347) cites “individuals state the Department of Public Works has been 
increasing their water extraction from Rota's spring/stream systems. 
Historically, this water source flowed year-around, yet now they are 
essentially dry most of each year” (see the species description “Rota 
blue damselfly,” above; and “Stream Ecosystem,” in the proposed rule (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/79-FR-59364">79 FR 59364</a>;
 October 1, 2014), for further discussion). Water extraction is an 
ongoing threat to the Rota blue damselfly. The loss of this perennial 
stream would remove the only known breeding and foraging habitat of the 
sole known population of the Rota blue damselfly, thereby likely leading
 to its extinction.</p>
          <h4 id="h-76">Recreational Vehicles</h4>

          <p id="p-317" data-page="59470">The savanna areas of Guam are 
popular for use of recreational vehicles. Damage and destruction caused 
by these vehicles are a direct threat to the plants <em>Hedyotis megalantha</em> and <em>Phyllanthus saffordii,</em>
 listed as endangered species in this final rule, as well as a threat to
 the savanna habitat that supports these plant species (Gutierrez 2013, 
in litt.; Guam DAWR 2013, pers. comm.). <em>Hedyotis megalantha</em> and <em>P. saffordii</em>
 are particularly at risk, as the only known individuals of these 
species are scattered on the savanna and local biologists have observed 
recreational vehicle tracks directly adjacent to these two species 
(Gutierrez 2013, in litt.; Guam DAWR 2013, pers. comm.).</p>
          <h4 id="h-77">Small Numbers of Individuals and Populations</h4>

          <p id="p-318" data-page="59470">Species that are endemic to 
single islands are inherently more vulnerable to extinction than are 
widespread species, because of the increased risk of genetic 
bottlenecks, random demographic fluctuations, climate change effects, 
and localized catastrophes, such as typhoons and disease outbreaks (Pimm
 <em>et al.</em> 1988, p. 757; Mangel and Tier 1994, p. 607). These 
problems are further magnified when populations are few and restricted 
to a very small geographic area, and when the number of individuals in 
each population is very small. Species with these population 
characteristics face an increased likelihood of extinction due to 
changes in demography, the environment, genetic bottlenecks, or other 
factors (Gilpin and Soulé 1986, pp. 24-34). Small, isolated populations 
often exhibit reduced levels of genetic variability, which diminishes 
the species' capacity to adapt and respond to environmental changes, 
thereby lessening the probability of long-term persistence (Barrett and 
Kohn 1991, p. 4; Newman and Pilson 1997, p. 361). Very small, isolated 
populations are also more susceptible to reduced reproductive vigor due 
to ineffective pollination (plants), inbreeding depression (plants and 
animals), and hybridization (plants and insects). The problems 
associated with small population size and vulnerability to random 
demographic fluctuations or natural catastrophes are further magnified 
by synergistic interactions with other threats, such as those discussed 
above (see <em>Factor A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range</em> and <em>Factor C. Disease or Predation,</em> above).</p>

          <p id="p-319" data-page="59470">The following 3 plant species have a very limited number of individuals (fewer than 50) in the wild: <em>Psychotria malaspinae, Solanum guamense,</em> and <em>Tinospora homosepala.</em>
 We consider these species highly vulnerable to extinction due to 
threats associated with small population size or small number of 
populations because:</p>

          <li id="p-320" data-page="59470">The only known occurrences of <em>Psychotria malaspinae, Solanum guamense,</em> and <em>Tinospora homosepala</em> are threatened either by ungulates, rats, brown treesnake, nonnative plants, fire, or a combination of these.

          <li id="p-321" data-page="59471">
<em>Psychotria malaspinae</em> is known from fewer than 10 scattered individuals, and <em>Solanum guamense</em> is known from a single individual (Yoshioka 2008, p. 15; Cook 2012, in litt.; CPH 2012f—<em>Online Herbarium Database;</em> Harrington <em>et al.</em> 2012, in litt.; Grimm 2013, in litt.; Rogers 2012, in litt.; WCSP 2012d—<em>Online Herbarium Database</em>).</li>
            </ul>
          
          <p id="p-322" data-page="59471">
            <em>Animals—</em> Like most native island biota, the single 
island endemics Guam tree snail, Langford's tree snail, and Rota blue 
damselfly are particularly sensitive to disturbances due to low number 
of individuals, low population numbers, and small geographic ranges. 
Additionally, the fragile tree snail, Mariana eight-spot butterfly, 
Mariana wandering butterfly, and Pacific sheath-tailed bat (Mariana 
subspecies) each have a low number of populations, even though they 
historically occurred on two or more islands within the Marianas 
Archipelago. Current data indicate that the only known remaining 
individuals of the Mariana eight-spot butterfly occur on Guam, there are
 no known individuals of the Mariana wandering butterfly on Guam or 
Rota, and the Pacific sheath-tailed bat (Mariana subspecies) now occurs 
only on Aguiguan. The fragile tree snail occurs in low number of 
populations on Guam (two populations) and Rota (one population). 
Furthermore, recent genetic analyses conducted on the fragile tree 
snail, Guam tree snail, and Mariana eight-spot butterfly on Guam show 
that the fragile tree snail and the Mariana eight-spot butterfly have no
 heterogeneity, even between different populations, rendering these 
species highly vulnerable to the negative effects associated with loss 
of genetic diversity. The Guam tree snail has a very low level of 
genetic diversity, but not enough to consider it exempt from the threats
 associated with low numbers (Lindstrom and Benedict 2014, pp. 26-27).</p>

          <p id="p-323" data-page="59471">We consider these 10 species 
to be especially vulnerable to extinction due to either low number of 
individuals or low number of populations, or both; because these species
 occur on single islands, or only two neighboring islands; are declining
 in number of individuals and range; have low or no detectable genetic 
diversity; and are consequently vulnerable and at risk from one or more 
of the following threats: Predation by nonnative rats, monitor lizards, 
and flatworms; habitat degradation and destruction by nonnative 
ungulates; fire; typhoons; drought; and water extraction (see <em>Factor A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range</em> and <em>Factor C. Disease or Predation,</em> above).</p>
          <h4 id="h-78">Conservation Efforts To Reduce Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence</h4>

          <p id="p-324" data-page="59471">We are unaware of any 
conservation actions planned or implemented at this time to abate the 
threats to the species negatively impacted by ordnance and live-fire 
(the plants <em>Cycas micronesica, Heritiera longipetiolata,</em> and <em>Psychotria malaspinae;</em>
 and the humped tree snail, Mariana eight-spot butterfly, and Slevin's 
skink); water extraction (Rota blue damselfly), recreational vehicles (<em>Hedyotis megalantha</em> and <em>Phyllanthus saffordii</em>), or low numbers (the plants <em>Psychotria malaspinae, Solanum guamense,</em> and <em>Tinospora homosepala;</em>
 the fragile tree snail, Guam tree snail, and Langford's tree snail; the
 Mariana eight-spot butterfly and Mariana wandering butterfly; and the 
Rota blue damselfly).</p>

          <p id="p-325" data-page="59471">We consider the threat from 
ordnance and live-fire training to be a serious and ongoing threat for 
four plant and three animal species addressed in this final rule (the 
plants <em>Cycas micronesica, Heritiera longipetiolata, Psychotria malaspinae,</em> and <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis;</em>
 and the humped tree snail, Mariana eight-spot butterfly, and Slevin's 
skink), because direct damage to individual plants and animals may be 
fatal, or cause enough damage to render them more vulnerable to other 
threats. We consider the threat from water extraction to be a serious 
and ongoing threat for the Rota blue damselfly because the spring that 
supplies Rota's municipal water is also the spring that supports the 
primary population of the only two known occurrences of the species. We 
consider recreational off-road vehicles a threat to the plants <em>Hedyotis megalantha</em> and <em>Phyllanthus saffordii</em> because off-road vehicles can damage individual plants and destroy the habitat that supports these two species.</p>

          <p id="p-326" data-page="59471">We consider the threat from 
limited numbers of populations and low numbers of individuals (fewer 
than 50) to be serious and ongoing for 3 plant species addressed in this
 final rule (<em>Psychotria malaspinae, Solanum guamense,</em> and <em>Tinospora homosepala</em>)
 because: (1) These species may experience reduced reproductive vigor 
due to ineffective pollination or inbreeding depression; (2) they may 
experience reduced levels of genetic variability, leading to diminished 
capacity to adapt and respond to environmental changes, thereby 
lessening the probability of long-term persistence; and (3) a single 
catastrophic event (<em>e.g.,</em> fire) may result in extirpation of 
remaining populations and extinction of the species. This threat applies
 to the entire range of each species.</p>

          <p id="p-327" data-page="59471">The threat to the fragile tree

the future because population numbers of these species are so low that: 
(1) They may experience reduced reproductive vigor due to inbreeding

or natural origin (<em>e.g.,</em> super typhoon), may result in 
extirpation of remaining populations and extinction of these species; 
and (4) species with few known locations are less resilient to threats 
that might otherwise have a relatively minor impact on widely 
distributed species. For example, an increase in predation of these 
species that might be absorbed in a widely distributed species could 
result in a significant decrease in survivorship or reproduction of a 
species with limited distribution. Additionally, the limited 
distribution of these species magnifies the severity of the impact of 
the other threats discussed in this final rule.</p>

          <h2 id="h-81">Summary of Comments and Recommendations</h2>
          <p id="p-335" data-page="59472">On October 1, 2014, we 
published a proposed rule to list 23 species (14 plants, 4 tree snails, 2
 butterflies, 1 bat, 1 skink, and 1 damselfly) as endangered or 
threatened species throughout their ranges (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/79-FR-59364">79 FR 59364</a>).
 The comment period for the proposal opened on October 1, 2014, for 60 
days, ending on December 1, 2014. We requested that all interested 
parties submit comments or information concerning the proposed rule. We 
contacted all appropriate State and Federal agencies, county 
governments, elected officials, scientific organizations, and other 
interested parties and invited them to comment. In addition, we 
published a public notice of the proposed rule on October 20, 2014, in 
the local Marianas Variety Guam Edition, Marianas Variety, and Pacific 
Daily News, at the beginning of the comment period. We received two 
requests for public hearings. On January 12, 2015, we published a notice
 (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/80-FR-1491">80 FR 1491</a>)
 reopening the comment period on the October 1, 2014, proposed rule 
(7959364), for an additional 30 days in order to allow interested 
parties more time for comments on the proposed rule. In that same 
document (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/80-FR-1491">80 FR 1491</a>;
 January 12, 2015), we announced two public hearings, each preceded by a
 public information meeting, as well as two separate public information 
meetings, for a total of four public information meetings altogether. 
The two public hearings preceded by public information meetings were 
held in the U.S. Territory of Guam (Guam) on January 27, 2015; and the 
U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) (Saipan) on 
January 28, 2015. The two separate public information meetings were held
 on the islands of Rota (CNMI) on January 29, 2015; and Tinian (CNMI) on
 January 31, 2015.</p>
          <p id="p-336" data-page="59472">During the comment periods, we
 received 23 comment letters, including 9 peer review comment letters, 
on the proposed listing of the 23 Mariana Island species. In this final 
rule, we address only those comments directly relevant to the proposed 
listing of 23 species in Guam and the CNMI. We received several comments
 that were not germane to the proposed listing of 23 species (for 
example, suggestions for future recovery actions should the species be 
listed); such comments are not addressed in this final rule.</p>
          <p id="p-337" data-page="59472">Three comment letters were 
from the CNMI Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR); one was 
from a representative in the CNMI legislature; two were from Guam 
government agencies (Guam Department of Agriculture, Division of Aquatic
 and Wildlife Resources (GDAWR); and Guam Bureau of Statistics and 
Planning); two were from Federal agencies (National Park Service and 
U.S. Navy); and six were from nongovernmental organizations or 
individuals. Nine letters were responses from requested peer reviews. 
The CNMI DLNR and one public commenter requested a public hearing and 
extension of the comment period. In response, we reopened the comment 
period for 30 days, from January 12, 2015, to February 11, 2015. In 
addition, during the public hearings held on January 27, 2015 (Guam), 
and January 28, 2015 (Saipan), seven individuals or organizations made 
oral comments on the proposed listing.</p>
          <p id="p-338" data-page="59472">All substantive information 
related to the listing of the 23 species provided during the comment 
periods, including technical or editorial corrections, has either been 
incorporated directly into this document or is addressed below (also see
 Summary of Changes from the Proposed Rule, above). Comments received 
were grouped into general issues specifically relating to the proposed 
listing status of the 14 plants, the 4 tree snails, the 2 butterflies, 
the bat, the skink, or the damselfly, and are addressed in the following
 summary and incorporated into the final rule as appropriate.</p>
          <h3 id="h-82">Peer Review</h3>

          <p id="p-339" data-page="59472">In accordance with our peer review policy published in the <strong>Federal Register</strong>
 on July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34270), we solicited expert opinions from 21 
knowledgeable individuals with scientific expertise on the Mariana 
Islands plants, tree snails, butterflies, bat, skink, and damselfly, and
 their habitats, including familiarity with the species, the geographic 
region in which these species occur, and principles of conservation 
biology. We received responses from nine of these peer reviewers. Eight 
of the nine peer reviewers supported our methods and conclusions, and 
one peer reviewer solely provided corrections to local common names. 
Four peer reviewers noted particular agreement with our evaluation of 
the scientific data informing our assessment of the conservation status 
of support for the listing of the four tree snails, and concurred with 
the associated status and threat assessments. Similarly, two peer 
reviewers noted particular agreement with our status assessment for the 
two butterflies; two peer reviewers noted particular support for the 
assessment of the bat; and one peer reviewer noted particular support 
for the assessment of the skink. We reviewed all comments received from 
the peer reviewers for substantive issues and new information regarding 
the listing of 23 species. All nine reviewers provided information on 
one or more of the Mariana Islands species, which was incorporated into 
this final rule (see also Summary of Changes from Proposed Rule). 
Several of the peer reviewers specifically commented that the proposed 
rule represented an exhaustive and largely accurate (barring some 
relatively minor corrections) assessment of the status and threats to 
the species; we did not receive any peer reviews that took general issue
 with the scientific rigor of our evaluation. Peer reviewer comments are
 addressed in the following summary and incorporated into the final rule
 as appropriate.</p>
          <h4 id="h-83">Peer Review General Comments</h4>
          <p id="p-340" data-page="59472">(1) <em>Comment:</em> One peer
 reviewer commented that many of the Chamorro names of the animals and 
plants listed in the proposed rule either do not conform to accepted 
orthography of the language or appear incorrect, and provided 
corrections for select species.</p>
          <p id="p-341" data-page="59472">
            <em>Our Response:</em> After the publication of the proposed
 rule, we solicited the guidance from a local language specialist to 
ensure proper use of Chamorro and Carolinian common names in all our 
documents regarding the 23 species, and to translate some of our public 
outreach material disseminated at the two public hearings (Guam and 
Saipan) and four public information meetings (Guam, Saipan, Rota, and 
Tinian) held in January 2015. We have incorporated all of the 
recommended changes to the Chamorro <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59473"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59473" data-page="59473" data-text="Start Printed Page 59473" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59473}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59473</span></span></span>and
 Carolinian common names for plants and animals under Table 1 and 
Summary of the 23 Species, above; and noted this change under Summary of
 Changes from the Proposed Rule, above. However, due to past 
complications with attempts to use diacritical marks in our rules, we 
have elected not to print them here. Please see Kerr (2014, in litt.) 
and USFWS (2015, in litt.) for the Chamorro and Carolinian names of 
plants and animals addressed in this final rule, with the proper 
diacritical marks. Additionally, the language expert we consulted did 
not change the spelling of Chamorro to Chamoru, as suggested by Kerr 
(2014, in litt.), so we retained the use of Chamorro for this final 
rule.</p>
          <p id="p-342" data-page="59473">(2) <em>Comment:</em> One peer
 reviewer commented that the proposed rule does not take into account 
information from Candidate Species surveys carried out by University of 
Guam (UOG) and University of Hawaii (UH) research biologists in 2013, 
and cited Lindstrom and Benedict 2014.</p>
          <p id="p-343" data-page="59473">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We have incorporated all new relevant
 information from the 2013 candidate species surveys conducted by UOG 
and UH biologists (Lindstrom and Benedict 2014, pp. 1-44, and Appendices
 A-E) under Description of the 23 Mariana Islands Species and Summary of
 Biological Status and Threats Affecting the 23 Mariana Islands Species,
 above.</p>
          <p id="p-344" data-page="59473">(3) <em>Comment:</em> One peer reviewer expressed confusion regarding the relationship between predation and herbivory under <em>Factor C. Disease and</em> Predation, above.</p>
          <p id="p-345" data-page="59473">
            <em>Our Response:</em> The term “predation” comes directly 
from the statutory language used in the identification of Factor C under
 section 4(a)(1) of the Act, which refers to the potential threat of 
“disease and predation.” In our discussions under Factor C, we use the 
term “herbivory” as analogous to predation, but our choice of 
terminology depends on the subject of the action. In general, we use the
 term herbivory if the subject being eaten is a plant, and the term 
predation if the subject being eaten is an animal.</p>
          <p id="p-346" data-page="59473">(4) <em>Comment:</em> One peer
 reviewer stated that it is not clear what an `ecosystem focus' means or
 how it would be implemented, particularly if a species occurs in more 
than one ecosystem.</p>
          <p id="p-347" data-page="59473">
            <em>Our Response:</em> The ecosystem approach allows us to 
assess and protect each individual species in need of conservation, 
whether that species occurs in a single ecosystem or multiple 
ecosystems, but to organize our rule in a more efficient manner. For 
each species under consideration for listing as a threatened species or 
endangered species under the Act, we must evaluate the threats to that 
species under a common “5-factor” framework as required by the statute. 
Specifically, the Act mandates us to consider whether a species may be a
 threatened species or endangered species because of any of the 
following factors: (A) The present or threatened destruction, 
modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range; (B) 
Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational
 purposes; (C) Disease or predation; (D) The inadequacy of existing 
regulatory mechanisms; or (E) Other natural or manmade factors affecting
 its continued existence. When species share the same ecosystem, they 
often have similar life-history requirements and experience the same 
threats. Grouping these species by shared ecosystems allows us to 
evaluate the threats shared by these species in a more efficient way and
 reduce repetition for the reader. Each species is still considered on a
 strictly individual basis as to whether or not it warrants listing.</p>
          <p id="p-348" data-page="59473">If an individual species is 
determined to meet the definition of a threatened species or endangered 
species under the Act, subsequent to listing that species will be the 
subject of a recovery plan. In the recovery phase, it is our intention 
that the ecosystem approach will be beneficial in terms of allowing us 
to focus on restoring all of the components within a particular 
ecosystem to its optimal health and functionality, which will support 
not only one or a few species of particular interest, but all native 
species within that ecosystem (for example, control of feral pigs would 
benefit all native species within a shared ecosystem). This approach 
should ultimately protect other vulnerable species that may otherwise 
need listing in the future as well, and is consistent with the stated 
purpose of the Act “to provide a means whereby the ecosystems upon which
 endangered species and threatened species depend may be conserved.”</p>
          <p id="p-349" data-page="59473">(5) <em>Comment:</em> Two peer
 reviewers expressed concern regarding the proposed military actions on 
Pagan, and the associated negative impacts these actions will have on 
one or more of the 23 species. One of these peer reviewers stated that 
either of the two butterflies, either the Mariana wandering butterfly or
 the Mariana eight-spot butterfly, may occur on Pagan.</p>
          <p id="p-350" data-page="59473">
            <em>Our Response:</em> The potential for future military 
actions on Guam and the CNMI is one of the threats we considered in 
making the listing determinations finalized in this document. As 
discussed in the section Summary of Biological Status and Threats 
Affecting the 23 Mariana Islands Species, we consider military actions 
on Pagan likely to negatively impact the humped tree snail and the 
Marianas skink, as well as any other of the 23 species that may occur on
 Pagan but have not yet been discovered or confirmed (<em>e.g., Cycas micronesica</em> or the two butterflies).</p>
          <p id="p-351" data-page="59473">(6) <em>Comment:</em> One peer
 reviewer stated that it is important to protect the humped tree snail 
and fragile tree snail at their known population sites on Guam (Haputo 
Ecological Reserve Area (HERA) and Hilaan), as well as the Mariana 
eight-spot butterfly and its host plants) from feral ungulates and human
 development, military and otherwise. Additionally, the reviewer 
suggested that we must protect all areas with potential habitat and 
sites of the host plants, not just the karst towers towards the cliff 
lines.</p>
          <p id="p-352" data-page="59473">
            <em>Our Response:</em> The Service appreciates support for 
the conservation of the tree snails and butterflies addressed in this 
final rule and the concurrence regarding the threats associated with 
ungulates and human development on these species. These suggestions will
 be taken into account as we move forward with recovery planning and 
implementation for these species.</p>
          <h4 id="h-84">Peer Review Comments on the Two Butterflies</h4>
          <p id="p-353" data-page="59473">(7) <em>Comment:</em> One peer
 reviewer commented that extensive surveys indicate that ungulate 
browsing has reduced the range of the two host plants for the Mariana 
eight-spot butterfly to only the most rugged karst within the forest 
ecosystem, and when one of these plants grows long enough to outreach 
the protection of the karst, browsing damage is usually observed. 
Additionally, this peer reviewer stated that the two host plants have 
been observed on Saipan as recently as 2011, which provides a more 
recent observation than what was cited in the proposed rule, and 
suggests that it is possible that the Mariana eight-spot butterfly may 
still occur on this island in small numbers.</p>
          <p id="p-354" data-page="59473">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We have added this information to Description of the 23 Mariana Islands Species, above.</p>
          <p id="p-355" data-page="59473">(8) <em>Comment:</em> One peer
 reviewer commented that recent surveys were conducted for the Mariana 
wandering butterfly on Tinian, Saipan, and Rota earlier this year, as 
well as Guam. The host plant (<em>Maytenus thompsonii</em>) was even more abundant than what Global Positioning Systems (GPS) data <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59474"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59474" data-page="59474" data-text="Start Printed Page 59474" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59474}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59474</span></span></span>reflected; however, not a single individual of the Mariana wandering butterfly was observed.</p>
          <p id="p-356" data-page="59474">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We appreciate being provided the most
 up-to-date survey data for the Mariana wandering butterfly on Guam, 
Rota, Tinian, and Saipan; and have added any new data under Description 
of the 23 Mariana Islands Species, above.</p>
          <p id="p-357" data-page="59474">(9) <em>Comment:</em> Two peer
 reviewers stated that small populations of either of the two 
butterflies may occur on other islands previously unreported if suitable
 habitat exists, or may remain in small obscure populations on islands 
where they have been known to occur but have not been observed for many 
years.</p>
          <p id="p-358" data-page="59474">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We agree that the best available 
information indicates that the two butterflies may exist in small, 
undetected, and obscure populations within their known ranges, or may 
possibly be on other islands within the Mariana Archipelago that provide
 suitable habitat, but where they have not yet been observed. We have 
added this information under Description of the 23 Mariana Islands 
Species, above. As this information is purely speculative, however, we 
did not consider it in our final determination.</p>
          <h4 id="h-85">Peer Review Comments on the Tree Snails</h4>
          <p id="p-359" data-page="59474">(10) <em>Comment:</em> One 
peer reviewer commented that shell collecting does not appear to be a 
current threat to the four tree snails. The CNMI Department of Land and 
Natural Resources (DLNR) made a similar comment, noting that the DLNR 
Division of Fish and Wildlife recently conducted a threat assessment for
 partulid snails in the CNMI in consultation with regional snail experts
 and concluded that shell collecting was not a threat to any snail 
population in the CNMI.</p>
          <p id="p-360" data-page="59474">
            <em>Our Response:</em> Based on the best available 
information, the Service has concluded that collection of tree snail 
species is an ongoing threat to tree snail species around the globe, 
including in the Mariana Islands, where the Service has recently 
observed jewelry (bracelets and necklaces) made from tree snails (USFWS 
2012, in litt.). Given the rarity of the tree snail species considered 
here, the potential collection of even a few individuals could have 
serious consequences for the population.</p>
          <p id="p-361" data-page="59474">(11) <em>Comment:</em> A survey in 2013 found a small number of humped tree snails in an isolated spot on Tinian.</p>
          <p id="p-362" data-page="59474">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We have updated this final rule to 
incorporate the new location data of the humped tree snail on Tinian. 
This new information is significant, since at the time of the proposed 
rule we did not have information to suggest that the humped tree snail 
was still found on that island.</p>
          <p id="p-363" data-page="59474">(12) <em>Comment:</em> One peer reviewer commented that it was difficult to understand how the brown treesnake poses a threat to the four tree snails.</p>
          <p id="p-364" data-page="59474">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We have attempted to clarify the 
nature of the threat posed by the brown treesnake to the tree snails in 
this final rule. The brown treesnake is not a direct threat to the four 
tree snails, but we conclude it poses an indirect threat to these 
species through alteration or degradation of habitat. The brown 
treesnake has been shown to alter forest structure as a secondary impact
 resulting from direct predation on native birds, which many native 
trees rely upon for seed dispersal (Rogers 2008, in litt.; Rogers 2009, 
in litt.). By interfering with the natural seed dispersal mechanism 
provided by native birds, the actions of the brown treesnake change the 
distribution, species composition, and ultimately the structure of the 
forest. The alteration of forest structure subsequently alters the 
microclimate requirements necessary to support tree snails on Guam, and 
other islands in the Marianas, ultimately degrading habitat quality and 
availability for the tree snails.</p>
          <p id="p-365" data-page="59474">(13) <em>Comment:</em> Two 
peer reviewers provided new information regarding the status of the 
fragile tree snail on Guam, and specifically the confirmed discovery of a
 second population at Hilaan Point, Dededo, totaling approximately 100 
individuals or less. Besides the new population at Hilaan and the 
original at Haputo Ecological Reserve Area, one peer reviewer suggested 
the fragile tree snail may occur in other undiscovered locations on 
Guam, where access is limited and difficult. Additionally, one peer 
reviewer noted that the fragile tree snail is often confused with the 
Guam tree snail due to superficial similarities, particularly juveniles 
of the Guam tree snail, even by trained biologists, although DNA 
comparisons have helped to confirm identifications.</p>
          <p id="p-366" data-page="59474">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We appreciate receiving the status 
update for the fragile tree snails, which we have included under 
Description of the 23 Mariana Islands Species, above. Additionally, we 
have added the distinguishing phenotypic traits of the fragile tree 
snail to our files (Fiedler 2014, in litt.).</p>
          <p id="p-367" data-page="59474">(14) <em>Comment:</em> One 
peer reviewer commented that the Guam tree snail is the most widespread 
and common partulid on Guam and its abundance is underreported in the 
proposed rule. This peer reviewer stated that surveys on Guam have 
documented at least 26 separate locations, varying from quite small in 
size to relatively large populations (<em>e.g.,</em> one population 
contained a single tree with over 700 individuals on it). The reviewer 
cautioned, however, that because a large tree may hold hundreds of 
snails and the majority of any given population, the loss of a single 
tree could potentially have a significant negative impact on a 
population. The researcher further noted that observed fluctuations of 
Guam tree snails from 100 individuals or so down to only a few 
individuals within a month's time indicates that populations are 
vulnerable to mass mortality, possibly from manokwari flatworms or other
 factors. The reviewer concluded by stating that, although the abundance
 and range of the Guam tree snail may be greater than previously 
reported, the species remains threatened by a variety of factors.</p>
          <p id="p-368" data-page="59474">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We appreciate the new information 
about the range and abundance of the Guam tree snail, and we have 
revised the description of the status of the species under the 
Description of the 23 Mariana Islands Species, above. We considered 
whether this information might change our evaluation of the status of 
the species. As part of our evaluation, we also carefully weighed the 
new information regarding the significant threat posed to all of the 
tree snails by the predatory manokwari flatworm, which we had 
underestimated in our proposed rule (see our response to Comment 25, 
below). We considered the fact that the Guam tree snail is a 
single-island endemic, and in addition to being subject to predation by 
the manokwari flatworm everywhere it is found on Guam, the Guam tree 
snail is subject to a significant number of other threats as well. Thus 
we concluded that, despite having a wider range and greater abundance 
than described in our proposed rule, the Guam tree snail currently 
remains at great risk of extinction due to a variety of factors 
including habitat loss, predation by flatworms and other nonnative 
mollusks, and a lack of genetic diversity.</p>
          <p id="p-369" data-page="59474">(15) <em>Comment:</em> One 
peer reviewer provided updated information regarding the status of the 
humped tree snail and noted that there are now two known populations of 
the species on Guam, both of which are located at HERA. The peer 
reviewer also recommended efforts to conserve all populations of the

 a captive-breeding program in the United Kingdom (UK) has been 
successful in culturing the humped tree snail (Pearce Kelly, pers. 
comm.), that population originated from a single individual, apparently 
collected in Saipan, and, therefore, genetic diversity in the captive 
population is likely very low.</p>

            <em>Our Response:</em> We appreciate receiving the new 
information and updated status on the humped tree snail. A recent survey
 conducted by Myounghee Noh and Associates (2014, pp. 1-28 and 
Appendices A and B) also reported this newly discovered second 
population of the species at HERA. We have added this new information 
under Description of the 23 Mariana Islands Species, above. At the time 
of the publication of the proposed rule, we were aware of only the one 
population with 50 scattered individuals along the forest edge adjacent 
to the sand at HERA.</p>
          <p id="p-371" data-page="59475">As discussed in this final 
rule, we understand that genetic work is ongoing on humped tree snail 
populations to elucidate any possible further divisions of the species 
into separate subspecies or subspecies. We agree there is a need for 
further research in this area. We must make our determination based on 
the best scientific data available, and at this point in time the humped
 tree snail is recognized as a single species. Our determination is that
 the humped tree snail, as currently described, warrants listing as an 
endangered species. If taxonomic changes are made in the future, we may 
reevaluate the status of any newly recognized species or subspecies at 
that point in time.</p>
          <p id="p-372" data-page="59475">(16) <em>Comment:</em> One peer reviewer stated there may be a few native predators on Guam's partulids, particularly crustaceans (<em>e.g.,</em> anomuran crabs (land hermit crabs, coconut crabs), as well as the `arboreal crab' (<em>Labuanium rotundatum</em>));
 however, crabs are not regarded as a major threat to partulids compared
 to the manokwari flatworm. This peer reviewer also commented that mites
 in the genus <em>Riccardoella</em> have been found on the native marsh snail and on another terrestrial snail, <em>Pythia scarabaeus.</em> Mites in the genus <em>Riccardoella</em> are known parasites of terrestrial snails and slugs; and until now have not been recorded from the Mariana Islands.</p>
          <p id="p-373" data-page="59475">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We have added native crabs and nonnative parasitic mites as potential threats to partulids in our threats analysis.</p>

upon observations of ants inside of shells from recently dead tree 
snails still stuck to vegetation and, while inspecting live partulids, 
one peer reviewer expressed concern regarding the potential for ants to 
prey upon partulids in the Marianas, particularly by the little fire ant
 (<em>Wasmannia auropuncta</em>) due to its aggressive nature.</p>
          <p id="p-375" data-page="59475">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We have added predation by ants as a potential threat to the partulid tree snails in the Marianas.</p>
          <p id="p-376" data-page="59475">(18) <em>Comment:</em> One 
peer reviewer commented that the negative impact of ungulates on 
partulid populations cannot be overstated and noted that the presence of
 pigs and deer in large numbers ensures that the understory of the 
vegetation will be trampled or devoured, altering the presence of snail 
home plants and degrading the soil. The reviewer noted repeated 
observations of locations that once had thriving tree snail populations 
being turned into “snail-free zones” due to the impact from pigs and 
deer.</p>
          <p id="p-377" data-page="59475">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We agree that both pigs and deer 
alter and significantly impact the habitat that supports the four tree 
snails; this threat is identified as one of the many factors that have 
led to the listing of these four species as endangered in this final 
rule (see <em>Factor A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range</em>).</p>
          <p id="p-378" data-page="59475">(19) <em>Comment:</em> One 
peer reviewer noted that, although tree snails in the Mariana Islands 
likely evolved to live upon native vegetation, there are no clear 
indications of obligate relationships with any particular type of tree 
or plant. This commenter further noted that all three partulid snail 
species on Guam (humped tree snail, Guam tree snail, and the fragile 
tree snail) are observed to use nonnative “home plants” to which they 
have apparently adapted. The peer reviewer suggested that an ecosystem 
approach may pose some challenges for conservation of the snails given 
their adaptation to nonnative vegetation, and recommended that snail 
conservation actions ensure the safety of native partulids inhabiting 
nonnative vegetation prior to removal or control of that vegetation.</p>
          <p id="p-379" data-page="59475">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We are aware that some partulid snail
 populations in the Mariana Islands occur on nonnative plants. For 
example, Service biologists have observed tree snails in Rota on 
nonnative plant species such as <em>Triphasia trifolia,</em> which is widely recognized to have negative impacts on native forest structure (Harrington <em>et al.</em> 2012, in litt., p. 44; CABI 2014-<em>Invasive Species Compendium Online Database</em>).
 Nevertheless, we appreciate the peer reviewer highlighting this 
nonnative plant management concern, and we agree this issue may present a
 management challenge in the future when we address the species' 
recovery. Most research, however, indicates the four proposed partulid 
snail species prefer native plant species as home plants or trees (see 
Description of the 23 Mariana Islands Species, above).</p>
          <p id="p-380" data-page="59475">(20) <em>Comment:</em> One 
peer reviewer stated that tree snails on Guam tend to occur in proximity
 to sources of fresh water and high humidity, and noted that these 
conditions are also ideal for the predatory manokwari flatworm, which 
has been observed at nearly every location where partulid snails occur 
on Guam.</p>
          <p id="p-381" data-page="59475">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We appreciate the information 
emphasizing the overlap between habitat preferences of tree snails and 
the distribution of the manokwari flatworm on Guam. Based on the 
comments of peer reviewers and new information available to us since the
 publication of the proposed rule (for example, high reproductive 
capacity of the flatworm and significant rates of tree snail mortality 
when the flatworm is present), we conclude that the threat posed by the 
manokwari flatworm is considerably greater than we had formerly 
understood. We have incorporated this new information into this final 
rule, and it is our intent to identify this threat as both a research 
need and management concern during future conservation and recovery 
efforts for the partulid snails.</p>
          <p id="p-382" data-page="59475">(21) <em>Comment:</em> One 
peer reviewer cautioned against a narrow focus of conservation effort 
for the Guam tree snail given its widespread distribution. The reviewer 
suggested that protecting only the Guam tree snail populations in HERA 
and Hilaan, due to its abundance and co-occurrence with the fragile tree
 snail and the humped tree snail, risks losing important biodiversity 
from other population sites.</p>
          <p id="p-383" data-page="59475">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We appreciate receiving this 
perspective from the peer reviewer. The prioritization of conservation 
and recovery actions for the tree snails and other species listed in 
this final rule will be identified and addressed in a forthcoming 
recovery plan.</p>
          <p id="p-384" data-page="59475">(22) <em>Comment:</em> Two 
peer reviewers provided new information and updates regarding the 
distribution of the humped tree snail based on recent surveys for the 
species. The reviewers noted that while once widespread on Guam, humped 
tree snails are now restricted to small populations at only 2 or 3 sites
 on Guam; a single remnant population on Saipan in one small area; one 
population of 1,000 individuals on Pagan Island in a small area within

            <em>Our Response:</em> We appreciate receiving the updated 
distribution status for the humped tree snail and have added any new 
relevant data under Description of the 23 Mariana Islands Species, 
above. In particular we appreciate learning of the recent discovery that
 a humped tree snail colony still occurs on the island of Tinian, as 
previous data had indicated that the species was extirpated from the 
island.</p>
          <p id="p-386" data-page="59476">(23) <em>Comment:</em> One 
peer reviewer suggested that partulid snail activity may be tied to 
ambient humidity and precipitation rather than circadian pattern, as 
described in the proposed rule, based upon the reviewer's observations 
of snails active during rainy days and snail inactivity during dry 
nights. The reviewer suggested this trait may increase the vulnerability
 of tree snails to changes in their environment, should climatic 
conditions lead to reduced precipitation and decreased humidity.</p>
          <p id="p-387" data-page="59476">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We appreciate receiving this new 
life-history information and included these details under Description of
 the 23 Mariana Islands Species, above. Additionally, we will address 
the matter further as we begin the recovery planning phase for these 
species.</p>
          <p id="p-388" data-page="59476">(24) <em>Comment:</em> One peer reviewer questioned the purpose of citing Crampton (as referenced in Berger <em>et al.</em> 2005) in the proposed rule regarding the presence of as many as 31 partulid snails on the underside of a single leaf of <em>Caladium.</em>
 The peer reviewer noted that, when partulid snails were observed in 
large clusters on leaves, it was always among relatively sizeable and 
dense, albeit rare, populations of snails, that would have been readily 
observed even if some individual leaves were not inspected.</p>
          <p id="p-389" data-page="59476">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We included Crampton's field 
observations in the proposed rule to illustrate the potential challenge 
in accurately surveying for numbers of snails in nature. If a population
 of snails has only 100 individuals, for example, missing a single leaf 
with 30 or more snails representing up to a third of the total 
population would result in a substantial underestimate of population 
size.</p>
          <p id="p-390" data-page="59476">(25) <em>Comment:</em> Three 
peer reviewers commented that the level of threat posed by the manokwari
 flatworm is erroneously understated in the proposed rule, and provided 
additional information about its predation efficiency and potential to 
impact the tree snails, including the following observations: One 
reviewer noted that the manokwari flatworm, once considered mostly 
ground-dwelling, is now known to climb trees and feed on juvenile 
partulid snails, and during field surveys the flatworm has been found to
 commonly occur several meters up in native trees and during most rain 
events. The reviewers emphasized that the flatworm is an effective 
predator on the tree snails of all age classes, and is likely the most 
important threat to these tree snails since it occurs in native, 
nonnative, and disturbed forest.</p>
          <p id="p-391" data-page="59476">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We appreciate receiving this new 
information, and we have updated the discussion of this threat under the
 Summary of Biological Status and Threats Affecting the 23 Mariana 
Islands Species. Additional new information we considered in evaluating 
the threat posed by the manokwari flatworm includes the high fecundity 
of the flatworm, which can reach the age of sexual reproduction in just 3
 weeks, and can lay cocoons at 7- to 10-day intervals, producing a mean 
of 5.2 juveniles from each cocoon (Kaneda <em>et al.</em> 1990, p. 526).
 The manokwari flatworm can live up to 2 years and survive extended 
periods of starvation, retaining their reproductive capacity after more 
than a year without feeding (Kaneda <em>et al.</em> 1990, p. 526). 
Compared to the partulid tree snails, which generally start reproducing 
at about 1 year of age and produce up to 18 young a year (living up to 5
 years), it is clear that the flatworm can quickly outnumber native tree
 snail species. This fact, combined with the observed high potential 
rates of predation by the flatworm under field test conditions (up to 90
 percent mortality of tree snails within 11 days (Sugiura <em>et al.</em>
 2006, p. 72)), and its rapid, unintentional introduction to new 
geographic areas, leads us to agree with the peer reviewers that we 
formerly underestimated the degree of threat posed by the manokwari 
flatworm.</p>
          <p id="p-392" data-page="59476">(26) <em>Comment:</em> One 
peer reviewer commented that investigations on Rota in 1990, and Saipan,
 Sarigan, and Pagan in 2010, indicate that none of the native <em>Partula</em>
 species are abundant or secure on any of those islands visited with the
 exception of Sarigan, on which only a single species, the humped tree 
snail, is present. With only Sarigan containing a vigorous population of
 the humped tree snail, the reviewer stated that this species most 
certainly has declined throughout a significant portion of its range, 
and pointed out that the humped tree snail is not secure even on 
Sarigan, as this island is not safe from other threats including new or 
existing invasive species, volcanic activity, etc. Another peer reviewer
 also commented that, despite the encouraging occurrence of seemingly 
large, healthy populations of humped tree snail on Sarigan, human access
 remains unrestricted on that island, and species such as rats, ants, or
 other snail predators may gain access to the island through unregulated
 human landings, resulting in invasive predators that are virtually 
impossible to control.</p>
          <p id="p-393" data-page="59476">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We have updated our records as 
appropriate regarding the field observations and data collected on 
partulids in the Marianas and incorporated this new information into 
this final rule. Although the proposed rule had noted that rats and 
monitor lizards are already present on Sarigan, we have noted the threat
 of additional potential predators to the island's population of the 
humped tree snail (<em>e.g.,</em> potential invasion by the manokwari 
flatworm, if it is not already present). We are aware that humans 
occasionally access the more remote northern islands and the associated 
risk of newly introduced nonnative species. We agree with the reviewers 
that the humped tree snail remains threatened by a variety of factors 
throughout its range, including on the island of Sarigan.</p>

          <p id="p-394" data-page="59476">(27) <em>Comment:</em> One 
peer reviewer concurred with our assessment of the status and threats to
 Slevin's skink, but noted that we had failed to note extirpated 
populations for Slevin's skink species in Table 1 of the proposed rule, 
as we had done for other species. The reviewer indicated that Slevin's 
skink was formerly present but is no longer found on Guam, Rota, and 
Tinian. The reviewer furthermore noted that, since Slevin's skink was 
not found on Pagan during the recent intensive surveys there (Reed <em>et al.</em>
 2010), it is most likely also extirpated, or at least certainly rare, 
on Pagan as well. Lastly, the reviewer suggested there may be an 
unverified record for Slevin's skink on Maug at this time.</p>

            <em>Our Response:</em> We appreciate the information and 
have corrected historical occurrences of Slevin's skink in Table 1, and 
noted the possibility of Slevin's skink being extirpated on Pagan under 
Description of the 23 Mariana Islands Species. We have added the 
possible occurrence of Slevin's skink on Maug to our files, but did not 
include this information here since this record is unverified at this

peer reviewer noted that recently published scientific articles improve 
known biological information about the Pacific sheath-tailed bat, and 
the reviewer suggested the proposed rule be updated to reflect this new 
information. Additionally, the researcher recommended that the proposed 
rule clarify several matters about the bat's biology, including for 
example, diet, occurrence, foraging activity, limiting factors on the 
island of Aguiguan, improved understanding of the threats to the

          <p id="p-402" data-page="59477">(31) <em>Comment:</em> The 
Department of Agriculture's Division of Aquatic and Wildlife Resources 
(GDAWR) commented that it concurs with our conclusions regarding the 
status of the 23 species. The Department noted that the accidental 
introduction of the brown treesnake had resulted in the demise of Guam's
 native forest birds, as well as negative impacts to native bat and 
lizard populations. The Department suggested that a loss of pollinators 
and seed dispersers from Guam's ecosystems has compounded impacts upon 
native forest regeneration, with cascading effects.</p>
          <p id="p-403" data-page="59477">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We agree with the GDAWR and have 
evaluated the effects of the brown treesnake on the 23 species in terms 
of both direct and indirect effects, including the indirect impact of 
the brown treesnake on the forest ecosystem through direct removal of 
animals that act as pollinators and seed dispersal agents through 
predation. We appreciate the GDAWR's comments and commitment to 
conservation on Guam, and look forward to future collaboration to 
conserve endangered and threatened species and their habitats on Guam 
and in the Mariana Islands.</p>
          <p id="p-404" data-page="59477">(32) <em>Comment:</em> The 
GDAWR noted that, while nine of Guam's native bird species and two fruit
 bat species were listed under the ESA due to the threat of extinction 
from the brown treesnake, the department had initiated recovery actions 
to save Guam's endemic bird species by collecting the remaining 
individuals from the wild and implementing ongoing active 
captive-breeding and release programs. The GDAWR comments that its 
vision remains to return these listed species, as well as those unlisted
 species that remain in the CNMI, to the forests on Guam through the 
control of brown treesnake and other predators that impact the 
restoration of the species.</p>
          <p id="p-405" data-page="59477">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We commend the GDAWR for its vision 
and efforts to conserve Guam's endangered species and other native 
biota. As discussed in this final rule, the brown treesnake continues to
 pose a significant threat to the native species of Guam, through both 
direct effects, such as predation, and by indirect effects, including 
altering forest structure by interfering with natural seed dispersal 
mechanisms. Gaining control of the brown treesnake and other nonnative 
predators will directly or indirectly benefit all 23 species in this 
final rule, as well as previously listed species in the Mariana Islands.</p>

suggested that these species are recoverable through mitigation measures
 and transplantation to areas where feral pigs and introduced deer are 
controlled, despite the threat of predation by the flatworm and 
predatory nonnative snails.</p>

 an endemic species that was once dominant in the limestone forests on 
Guam. They concurred with our assessment that fadang has been hit hard 
by introduced pests (most notably, the cycad scale) that limit its 
growth and reproduction. The GDAWR expressed support for the listing of 
this species, which will in turn provide for the recovery of other 
native species that depend on native forest.</p>

            <em>Our Response:</em> We appreciate the CNMI DLNR's 
agreement with our assessment of the conservation status of 7 of the 23 
species addressed in this final rule. Comments from the CNMI DLNR 
relevant to the other CNMI species considered in this final rule are 
addressed separately in response to the comments noted above.</p>
          <p id="p-414" data-page="59478">(37) <em>Comment:</em> The 
CNMI DLNR commented that they are unable to verify the claim in the 
proposed rule that the Mariana eight-spot butterfly once occurred on 
Saipan, and the modern range does not appear to include the CNMI. The 
proposed rule cites two unpublished reports (Schreiner and Nafus 1996, 
Schreiner and Nafus 1997); however, neither of these reports cite a 
source for the occurrence on Saipan. In addition, the 1996 paper states 
“no specimens were found in the fairly extensive collection of 
butterflies at the Saipan Department of Agriculture.” The DLNR suggests 
that, despite recent targeted surveys, there is no verifiable evidence 
that the Mariana eight-spot butterfly has been found on Saipan within at
 least the last 40 years; therefore, Saipan should not be considered 
within the range of the Mariana eight-spot butterfly.</p>
          <p id="p-415" data-page="59478">
            <em>Our Response:</em> The proposed rule described Saipan as
 part of the historical range of the Mariana eight-spot butterfly, and 
noted that it may possibly be extirpated from that island; only Guam was
 included within the description of the known contemporary range of the 
species. To clarify where the data regarding the historical occurrence 
of the Mariana eight-spot butterfly on Saipan originates, there is a 
placeholder and label at the Bishop Museum for a Mariana eight-spot 
butterfly specimen collected on Saipan on July 30, 1920, which was 
loaned to the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) (Richardson 
2015, in litt.). The new collection manager at the Bishop Museum has 
requested information from AMNH regarding this specimen. If this 
specimen is in error, the known range for the Mariana eight-spot 
butterfly will be edited to solely include Guam; however, at this time, 
evidence suggests that the historical range of this species includes 
Guam and Saipan (Richards 2015, in litt.). At least one species expert 
suggests that the Mariana eight-spot butterfly and Mariana wandering 
butterfly may persist on some of the northern Mariana Islands in very 
low numbers, making observations difficult (Rubinoff 2014, in litt.). 
Butterfly experts continue to search islands not previously known to 
support either of the two butterflies addressed in this rule.</p>
          <p id="p-416" data-page="59478">(38) <em>Comment:</em> The CNMI DLNR stated that the Rota blue damselfly appears to be associated with an uncommon specialized habitat on Rota, <em>i.e.,</em>
 freshwater streams at relatively high elevation. Additionally, they 
report a new occurrence of the Rota blue damselfly, located at a stream 
east of the Water Cave that is not connected to the Water Cave (Okgok) 
Stream (Zarones <em>et al.</em> 2015b, in litt.). A comprehensive survey
 of all potential habitat sites on Rota has not been conducted, and no 
surveys of potential habitat on Saipan have been conducted.</p>
          <p id="p-417" data-page="59478">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We have added the stream east of the 
Water Cave as a new population site for the Rota blue damselfly under 
Description of the 23 Mariana Islands Species, above; and to Summary of 
Changes from the Proposed Rule, above. We note, however, that this 
observation was of a single individual. In addition, we concur that 
comprehensive surveys of all potential habitat have not been conducted 
on Rota and Saipan. The Service looks forward to collaborating with the 
CNMI DLNR to collect more data on this species and monitor known 
populations.</p>
          <p id="p-418" data-page="59478">(39) <em>Comment:</em> The 
CNMI DLNR stated that the status and trends of the Slevin's skink are 
unknown in the northern Mariana Islands The DLNR assumes that the 
Slevin's skink persists on Guguan and Asuncion, in addition to the 
occurrences on Alamagan and Sarigan described in the proposed rule. The 
DLNR's Division of Fish and Wildlife will be conducting expeditions to 
Guguan in 2015 and 2016, which should permit confirmation of its 
persistence there, as well as provide information on the status of 
potential invasive predators.</p>
          <p id="p-419" data-page="59478">
            <em>Our Response:</em> The skink was historically known from
 Guam, Cocos Island, Rota, Tinian, Pagan, Sarigan, Guguan, Alamagan, and
 Asuncion; however, it is believed to be extirpated from Guam, Rota, 
Aguiguan, and Tinian, and was not observed during a recent survey on 
Pagan (Reed <em>et al.</em> 2010, pp. 22, 27) (see Description of the 23
 Mariana Islands Species, above). We concur that the status of Slevin's 
skink is unknown on several of the northern islands (<em>e.g.,</em> 
Sarigan, Guguan, Alamagan, and Asuncion); however, the skink is thought 
to be extirpated on four, now possibly five, of the nine islands on 
which it was previously known to occur. Of the islands where it is known
 to persist, Slevin's skink has begun to recover from the effects of 
past threats (ungulates, which were removed) only on Sarigan, and even 
there it still faces other threats (<em>e.g.,</em> rats). It appears to 
be very rare on the other small islands where it remains, and may be 
extirpated from Pagan. The greatly reduced distribution of this species,
 now restricted to roughly 10 percent of its former range, combined with
 the risk from rat predation on all of the northern islands on which it 
occurs; predation by monitor lizards on Sarigan, Alamagan, and Pagan; 
habitat degradation by feral pigs and goats on Alamagan and Pagan; and 
habitat destruction from proposed military actions on Pagan leads us to 
conclude that Slevin's skink warrants the protections of the Act. We 
look forward to learning the results from the planned surveys, and to 
collaborating with the CNMI DLNR to learn more about the status of 
Slevin's skink in the northern islands.</p>

 still occurs on Rota, contrary to the information presented in the 
proposed rule. They provided information that a field biologist observed
 one large individual of <em>Heritiera longipetiolata</em> on the Rota Sabana in 2010. Additionally, the Rota DLNR is currently propagating and outplanting <em>Heritiera longipetiolata</em> (Manglona, pers. comm. 2014).</p>

the original reference for an occurrence on Saipan (Camacho and MES

 from an estimate we made using the best available data we had at the 
time (Guerrero 2013, in litt.; Williams 2013, in litt.; Wiles <em>in</em>
 IUCN Red List 2014, in litt.). Regarding the number of individuals on 
Tinian, new information has revealed that there are at minimum 30 to 40 
individuals of <em>Heritiera longipetiolata</em> in the southeast 
portion of Tinian, and likely more individuals in the area along the 
forested eastern portion of Tinian (Spaulding 2015, in litt.). We have 
corrected the estimated number of individuals for <em>Heritiera longipetiolata</em>
 on Tinian under Description of the 23 Mariana Islands Species, above. 
The Service has been in contact with local biologists, including those 
from the CNMI DLNR, since 2012 in preparation of the development of this

 that we contact the State Forester directly to discuss the status and 
occurrences of this species in the CNMI.</p>
          <p id="p-425" data-page="59479">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We agree that further surveys need to be conducted to better understand the number and status of individuals of <em>Heritiera longipetiolata</em>
 on the islands of Saipan, Rota, and Tinian in the CNMI. We attempted to
 contact the State Forester directly as suggested on April 22, 2015, to 
discuss the status of this species in the CNMI, but to date have not 
received a response. Although we acknowledge that more information is 
always desirable, the Act requires that we make our decisions based on 
the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of our 
determination.</p>
          <p id="p-426" data-page="59479">(43) <em>Comment:</em> The CNMI DLNR requested that the Service provide the reference for the eight individuals of <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis</em>
 on Rota in 2004, and whether or not these individuals were naturally 
occurring or outplanted since the proposed rule does not consider 
outplanted individuals as an occurrence. The proposed rule states 
“Currently on Rota, <em>T. rotensis</em> is known from two occurrences, each composed of fewer than 5 individuals” and cites Harrington <em>et al.</em> (2012); however, Harrington <em>et al.</em>
 (2012) does not provide the exact numbers, only “low number of 
individuals.” This reference does state the two locations of the 
occurrences where this species was observed (Palii and Water Cave). In 
2014, DLNR completed a survey of all known locations of naturally 
occurring and outplanted individuals of <em>T. rotensis</em> on Rota and
 found nine living naturally occurring individuals and one dead 
individual. Additionally, they report 30 surviving outplanted 
individuals, ranging in size from 4 to 23 ft (1.3 to 7 m), spread out 
across the island (J. Manglona, T. Reyes, R. Ulloa, pers. comm. 2014). 
The Rota DLNR Forestry Division has been carrying out an outplanting 
program for <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis</em> for several years.</p>
          <p id="p-427" data-page="59479">
            <em>Our Response:</em> It is correct that the Service does 
not count outplanted individuals in our analyses regarding the number of
 individuals and occurrences for plant species. We appreciate the update
 regarding the number of <em>T. rotensis</em> individuals on Rota, and 
have added this updated information under Description of the 23 Mariana 
Islands Species, above, in addition to correcting the language to 
reflect precisely the wording in the cited report regarding low numbers 
of individuals.</p>
          <p id="p-428" data-page="59479">(44) <em>Comment:</em> The 
CNMI DLNR and a representative of the CNMI legislature stated that the 
proposed listing for many of the 23 species was based on their status 
and threats on Guam with little consideration to their status and 
threats in the CNMI, and that the proposed rule provided inadequate 
information to support the determination of endangered status for 
several of the 23 species. Species specifically mentioned include all 
four orchid species (<em>Bulbophyllum guamense, Dendrobium guamense,</em>
            <em>Nervilia jacksoniae,</em> and <em>Tuberolabium guamense</em>), the shrub to small tree <em>Maesa walkeri,</em> and the herbaceous plant <em>Solanum guamense.</em> Their comments include the following: There is no evidence to indicate a decline of <em>Bulbophyllum guamense, Dendrobium guamense,</em>
            <em>Nervilia jacksoniae, Tuberolabium guamense,</em> or <em>Maesa walkeri</em>
 on Rota, and these species are much more common in the CNMI than 
indicated in the proposed rule. They provided the results of a 7-day 
survey by DLNR biologists (conducted in 2015) with both observed numbers
 and, by extrapolation, estimated counts for each of these species on 
Rota. Based on their observations, DLNR biologists estimated the total 
number of individuals on the western portion of Rota to be approximately
 16,000 for <em>Bulbophyllum guamense,</em> approximately 35,000 for <em>Dendrobium guamense,</em> approximately 100,000 for <em>Nervilia jacksoniae,</em> and approximately 14,600 for <em>Tuberolabium guamense.</em> For <em>Maesa walkeri,</em>
 they were unable to calculate the density and, therefore, make an 
estimate for the Sabana region, but the DLNR stated they are confident 
that thousands of <em>Maesa walkeri</em> exist on the Sabana plateau, and perhaps other locations on Rota. They could not say at this time whether or not <em>Maesa walkeri</em> is restricted to the Sabana Region.</p>
          <p id="p-429" data-page="59479">
            <em>Our Response:</em> The Service evaluates a species for 
potential listing under the Act based on the status of that species 
throughout all or a significant portion of its range at the time of the 
determination. For some of the 23 Mariana Islands species, that range is
 represented by a single island (<em>e.g., Eugenia bryanii</em> and Langford's tree snail), while other species have ranges that include two or more islands (<em>e.g., Bulbophyllum guamense</em>
 and the humped tree snail) (see Description of the 23 Mariana Islands 
Species and Table 1, above, for the range of each of the 23 species). In
 each case our evaluation includes consideration of the status of these 
species and threats acting upon them throughout the entirety of their 
present ranges, which for each of the four orchids and <em>Maesa walkeri,</em>
 predominantly includes the islands of Guam and, in the CNMI, Rota. The 
DLNR provided new information from surveys conducted since the 
publication of the proposed rule demonstrating that these five plant 
species are more numerous on the island of Rota than previous data 
indicated, each with a population structure consisting of seedlings, 
juveniles, and adults. We have incorporated this new data into our 
consideration of the status of these species, and conclude that this 
information indicates these five plant species are not as imperiled 
throughout their ranges as we had understood at the time of the proposed
 rule. However, these species are still susceptible to multiple threats,
 including habitat destruction and modification by nonnative plants and 
animals, the potential effects of climate change, and fire on Rota. 
Additionally, at least 50 percent of their respective ranges occur on 
the island of Guam, where these species once occurred in abundance but 
now exist in very low number of individuals and face similar threats as 
on Rota, in addition to habitat destruction and modification by urban 
development, military development and training, brown treesnakes, and 
feral pigs.</p>

          <p id="p-430" data-page="59479">The Act defines an endangered 
species as “any species which is in danger of extinction throughout all 
or a significant portion of its range,” and a threatened species as “any
 species which is likely to become an <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59480"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59480" data-page="59480" data-text="Start Printed Page 59480" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59480}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59480</span></span></span>endangered
 species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant 
portion of its range.” Therefore, because the four orchid species (<em>Bulbophyllum guamense, Dendrobium guamense, Nervilia jacksoniae, Tuberolabium guamense</em>) and <em>Maesa walkeri</em>
 appear relatively healthy on Rota, but are threatened by the 
above-mentioned factors throughout all of their ranges, and have 
declined across at least 50 percent of their ranges (<em>i.e.,</em> on 
Guam), we have retained them in this final listing determination but 
have changed their status to threatened species, as we conclude they are
 at risk of becoming endangered within the foreseeable future. All new 
data received during the comment period for these five species have been
 added to Description of the 23 Mariana Islands Species and Summary of 
Biological Status and Threats Affecting the 23 Mariana Islands Species, 
below. Further, our rationale for listing each of these five species as 
threatened species versus endangered species is discussed under 
Determination, below.</p>
          <p id="p-431" data-page="59480">(45) <em>Comment:</em> The 
CNMI DLNR commented that the Service used inaccurate scientific methods 
to determine the status of the 23 species and the proposed rule contains
 several inaccuracies regarding sources of citations and misleading use 
of references. Specifically, they stated that the Service should have 
conducted comprehensive surveys across all 14 islands of the CNMI in 
order to determine the status of the respective species reported to 
occur historically or currently in the CNMI. Furthermore, they felt the 
Service relied upon a broad range of factors purported as causing 
declines with little to no direct scientific evidence that these factors
 are negatively affecting each species (<em>i.e.,</em> inadequate regulatory mechanisms, typhoons, and climate change).</p>
          <p id="p-432" data-page="59480">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We agree that conducting 
comprehensive surveys across all 14 islands within the CNMI would be 
ideal; however, this is not practical or possible. As required by the 
Act, we have relied upon the best scientific and commercial data 
available to inform our evaluation and decision. For example, the 
references cited show that the threats outlined in the proposed rule, 
and this final rule, negatively affect one or more species, their 
habitat(s), or both (see Summary of Biological Status and Threats 
Affecting the 23 Mariana Islands Species, above). In our analysis, we 
thoroughly considered whether these threats, acting either singly or in 
concert, are affecting each of these species to the degree that the 
species meets the definition of an endangered species or threatened 
species under the Act. We affirm our position that threats associated 
with climate change, inadequate regulatory mechanisms, and typhoons are 
well supported, as detailed and referenced in this document. Each of 
these stressors may not necessarily act as a direct threat to the 
species, but may be considered a contributing factor to endangered or 
threatened status when evaluated in conjunction with other stressors 
acting on the species. As described in this final rule, considered 
collectively, our evaluation leads us to the conclusion that the 
negative effects of all these threats on these species, which are 
already vulnerable due to restricted ranges and reduced population sizes
 and numbers, are such that they meet the definition of an endangered 
species or threatened species under the Act. Further, minor corrections 
and changes to the citations are noted under Summary of Comments and 
Recommendations, herein, or have been directly incorporated into this 
final rule. More substantial corrections and changes are noted under 
Summary of Changes from the Proposed Rule, above.</p>
          <p id="p-433" data-page="59480">(46) <em>Comment:</em> The 
CNMI DLNR commented that the Service used arbitrary definitions of the 
term “decline.” The use of decline should be consistent and use actual 
numbers of individuals rather than a decline in overall range (<em>i.e.,</em> a decline in the number of islands on which a species occurs).</p>
          <p id="p-434" data-page="59480">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We believe this may be a matter of 
semantics. In the proposed rule, we used the word “decline” as a synonym
 for “reduction” or “loss.” We recognize that some readers may prefer 
the term “decline” to be used in association with specific quantitative 
data, as in numbers of individuals, whereas the term “reduction” may be 
considered more appropriately used with regard to more general 
qualities, such as the range of the species. However, whether called a 
decline or a reduction, a significant loss of a species from its former 
range is widely recognized throughout the conservation literature as a 
threat because it reduces the redundancy and resiliency of that species 
to withstand future perturbations. It may also result in a significant 
loss of evolutionary or adaptive capacity, through a loss of genetic 
diversity. For example, the range of the Mariana subspecies of the 
Pacific sheath-tailed bat has either declined or been reduced from 
possibly seven islands to only one, Aguiguan. The fact that the range of
 this subspecies has now been diminished such that it now exists in a 
single known population on only one island renders it vulnerable to 
extinction, regardless of the metric used to describe that loss of 
range. In addition, it is reasonable to conclude that a species that has
 experienced a significant reduction in range has also been reduced in 
abundance.</p>
          <p id="p-435" data-page="59480">(47) <em>Comment:</em> The CNMI DLNR and one public commenter stated that the proposed rule contains unreasonable assumptions (<em>i.e.,</em>
 threats, impacts to species, and invasive species), is based on little 
to no empirical data, and that both the ecosystem approach and climate 
change sections are oversimplified. The ESA lists species, not 
ecosystems, and is a species-based regulation. As such, the factors must
 be considered as they individually affect species, whether directly or 
indirectly.</p>
          <p id="p-436" data-page="59480">
            <em>Our Response:</em> The proposed rule describes the known
 negative impacts of nonnative animals and plants, the projected effects
 of climate change, and other threats as reported in the peer-reviewed 
scientific conservation literature. The negative impacts on species and 
on ecosystems resulting from the introduction of nonnative species are 
well documented around the globe (Vitousek <em>et al.</em> 1997, pp. 1-16; Reaser <em>et al.</em> 2007, pp. 98-111; Pimentel 2011, pp. 1-7; Simberloff 2011, in litt.; Simberloff <em>et al.</em>
 2013, pp. 58-60). Additionally, climate change impacts at the ecosystem
 and species level are documented around the globe and include, but are 
not limited to, alteration in humidity, temperature, and sea level, 
which subsequently result in species range shifts, alterations of a 
specific microhabitat upon which select species depend, or disruption in
 pollination regimes (<em>e.g.,</em> disruption in pollinator life cycle
 or flowering life cycle of a plant to where they are no longer in sync 
to promote pollination) (Chen <em>et al.</em> 2011, pp. 1,024-1,026; Saikkonen <em>et al.</em> 2012, pp. 239; Robbirt <em>et al.</em>
 2014, pp. 2,845-2,849; Willmer 2014, pp. R1133-R1135; Lambers 2015, pp.
 501-502; Urban 2015, pp. 1-33). Although we may not have empirical data
 that definitively demonstrates or quantifies the effect of these threat
 factors specific to each species considered in this final rule, if 
those threat factors are present, it is reasonable to conclude that they
 would have the same negative impact on any of the 23 Mariana Islands 
species that has been observed in other situations and reported in the 
literature. We have attempted to clarify here that although the specific
 future effects of climate change cannot be determined at this point, 
the anticipated changes in environmental conditions as a result of 
climate change are likely to further exacerbate the existing threats to 
the 23 <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59481"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59481" data-page="59481" data-text="Start Printed Page 59481" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59481}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59481</span></span></span>species.
 As required by the Act, we must make our determinations based on the 
best scientific and commercial data available. Lacking observations of 
how each of the 23 Mariana Islands species may specifically respond to 
the threat factors considered here, we must rely upon reasonable 
assumptions regarding the effects of those threats as informed by the 
best available science.</p>

          <p id="p-437" data-page="59481">We agree that the ESA lists 
species, not ecosystems, and this is a species-based regulation. Under 
the Act, we determine whether a species is an endangered species or a 
threatened species based on any of five factors (see Summary of 
Biological Status and Threats Affecting the 23 Mariana Islands Species, 
above), and we are required to make listing determinations solely on the
 basis of the best available scientific and commercial data <em>available</em>
 [emphasis ours] (sections 4(a)(1) and 4(b)(1)(A) of the Act). As 
described in this final rule, we have thoroughly considered the best 
scientific and commercial data available for each of the species under 
consideration, and have made our determination as to status for each 
species individually. It is a fact that by virtue of occurring in the 
same ecosystem, many of these species experience the same threat 
factors. These species are organized by ecosystem in our proposed and 
final rules solely for the purpose of considering threats that are 
shared by all species that occur in those ecosystems; this avoids 
redundancy in the rule, as well as recognizes that for the purposes of 
potential subsequent recovery actions, should the species be listed, 
management to reduce those threats would collectively benefit all 
species that occur in that ecosystem. This “ecosystem” approach to 
recovery is consistent with the stated purpose of the Act under section 
2(b), which states that the Act is “to provide a means whereby the 
ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend 
may be conserved.” Nonetheless, as clearly stated in this rulemaking, 
our evaluation and determination regarding the status of each species is
 made on a case-by-case basis, and each species is added individually to
 §§ 17.11 and 17.12 of the Code of Federal Regulations; ecosystems are 
not a valid subject for listing under the Act (see Regulation 
Promulgation, below).</p>

 on six of the CNMI islands are derived strictly from herbarium records 
and plant species incidental observation lists. No comprehensive 
quantitative surveys have been conducted for <em>S. guamense</em> anywhere in the CNMI. Without any recent systematic botanical surveys to prove otherwise, DLNR assumes <em>S. guamense</em> persists on all six islands of the CNMI where it was previously reported. They report a plan to search for <em>S. guamense</em> on a 2015 Department expedition to Guguan, and on other northern islands whenever the opportunity arises.</p>
          <p id="p-439" data-page="59481">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We agree that additional data regarding the status of <em>S. guamense</em>
 would be desirable. However, under the Act, we are required to make 
listing determinations solely on the basis of the best available 
scientific and commercial data <em>available</em> [emphasis ours] 
(sections 4(a)(1) and 4(b)(1)(A) of the Act). Further, we consider the 
status of a species throughout its entire range, regardless of political
 boundaries; that is, in this case, we do not consider whether the 
species warrants listing just in the CNMI, but wherever it occurs. The 
best available data show that <em>S. guamense</em> once occurred on the 
islands of Guam, Rota, Saipan, Tinian, Asuncion, Guguan, and Maug (see 
Description of the 23 Mariana Islands Species, above). We have no data 
available to us to suggest that it continues to be extant on any of 
these islands, with the exception of Guam. Currently, the only known 
occurrence of this species comes from a 1994 report on Andersen AFB on 
Guam (Perlman and Wood 1994, p. 152), where a single occurrence of one 
individual was observed (Perlman and Wood 1994, pp. 135-136). When the 
best available scientific data indicate that a species has been reduced 
to a single known individual, it meets the definition of an endangered 
species under the Act.</p>
          <p id="p-440" data-page="59481">(49) <em>Comment:</em> The CNMI DLNR commented that, because <em>Solanum guamense</em>
 is reported to occur on limestone cliff and terrace habitats on the 
southern islands of CNMI, and the northern islands of CNMI only contain 
volcanic soils, <em>S. guamense</em> clearly occupies a different habitat in the northern islands.</p>
          <p id="p-441" data-page="59481">
            <em>Our Response:</em> Based on the best available 
information, the physical nature of the substrate is more likely to be 
the defining factor identifying habitat that supports <em>S. guamense.</em>
 However, we do not disagree that it may occupy a different habitat type
 in the northern islands of CNMI. Muller-Dombois and Fosberg (1998, p. 
243) observed that the forest type on rough lava flows on some of the 
northern islands, especially Alamagan, is similar in aspect and even in 
composition to the forest on rough limestone in the southern Marianas, 
leading these researchers to suggest that the physical nature of the 
substratum may be of greater importance than the chemical composition.</p>
          <p id="p-442" data-page="59481">(50) <em>Comment:</em> The CNMI DLNR stated that development and urbanization are not a threat to the four orchid species (<em>Bulbophyllum guamense, Dendrobium guamense,</em>
            <em>Nervilia jacksoniae,</em> and <em>Tuberolabium guamense</em>) or <em>Maesa walkeri</em>
 on Rota, and that the threat of development and urbanization on Rota is
 overstated. They additionally stated that Aguiguan is the only 
uninhabited southern island of CNMI, and dispute the assertion that 
ecotourism development would negatively affect the forest and cave 
ecosystems that support the humped tree snail, Langford's tree snail, 
and the Pacific sheath-tailed bat (Marianas subspecies). They point out 
that Tinian community leaders with an interest in ecotourism have 
proactively initiated consultations with DLNR Division of Fish and 
Wildlife staff to ensure that native species and habitats on Aguiguan 
are conserved and enhanced, as they feel that these are the foundation 
of a successful ecotourism enterprise. Finally, they state that Slevin's
 skink occurs only on northern islands under no threat of development.</p>
          <p id="p-443" data-page="59481">
            <em>Our Response:</em> Although development and agriculture are not primary threats to the four orchids or <em>Maesa walkeri</em>
 on Rota, the threat from development exists on Guam, which consists of 
more than 50 percent of their entire ranges. Additionally, we placed the
 proposed ecoresort on Aguiguan, although currently uninhabited, under 
the general category of development and urbanization (despite being 
aimed at ecotourism) since the proposed construction on this island will
 remove or degrade habitat for the Pacific sheath-tailed bat, the humped
 tree snail, and Langford's tree snail. The only known population of 
Pacific sheath-tailed bats occurs on Aguiguan, and any loss of habitat, 
including foraging areas, will negatively impact this species. 
Similarly, Aguiguan is the only island where Langford's tree snail has 
been observed. The proposed military actions and associated 
infrastructure on Pagan and Tinian are considered development that will 
negatively impact the plant <em>Heritiera longipetiolata,</em> tentatively the plant <em>Cycas micronesica</em>
 (pending identification on Pagan), the humped tree snail, and Slevin's 
skink. Listing determinations are based solely on the best available 
scientific and commercially available data relevant to the status of the
 species; by statute we cannot consider the potential economic <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59482"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59482" data-page="59482" data-text="Start Printed Page 59482" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59482}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59482</span></span></span>or

meets the definition of an endangered species or threatened species 
under the Act.</p>
          <p id="p-444" data-page="59482">(51) <em>Comment:</em> The 
CNMI DLNR stated that the scope and timing of potential expansion of 
military training activities and possible impacts on proposed species on
 Tinian and Pagan is speculation at this time. The proposed rule claims 
that <em>Bulbophyllum guamense</em> was historically on Pagan but is not
 currently found there, and that the proposed military training on Pagan
 will negatively impact the species. They claim this argument is flawed 
because if <em>Bulbophyllum guamense</em> has been extirpated from Pagan, future military activities there cannot negatively impact the species.</p>
          <p id="p-445" data-page="59482">
            <em>Our Response:</em> The proposed actions on Tinian and 
Pagan, if implemented, pose a direct threat to the species now known to 
occur there: The plant <em>Heritiera longipetiolata,</em> the humped tree snail, Slevin's skink, and possibly <em>Cycas micronesica</em> (pending confirmation on Pagan). In addition, we note that these activities may negatively affect the historical habitat of <em>Bulbophyllum guamense.</em> Although military training and activities are not a direct threat to individuals of <em>B. guamense</em>
 since it no longer occurs on Pagan, these activities could negatively 
impact its habitat on Pagan and preclude future recovery efforts for the
 species, thus affecting its conservation. Because these actions have 
been officially proposed in the CNMI Joint Military Training (JMT) draft
 Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)/Overseas EIS (<em><a date="10/01/2015" href="http://www.cnmijointmilitarytrainingeis.com/">http://www.cnmijointmilitarytrainingeis.com/​</a></em>), we conclude there is a reasonable expectation that they will be implemented, and thus are more than just speculation.</p>
          <p id="p-446" data-page="59482">(52) <em>Comment:</em> The 
CNMI DLNR commented that the status of the Anatahan feral pig population
 is unknown following the 2003 volcanic eruption. Feral pigs are present
 on Alamagan, Pagan, and Agrihan, and could potentially threaten the 
humped tree snail and Slevin's skink. On Pagan, they may threaten <em>Cycas micronesica.</em> Feral pigs do not co-occur with <em>Heritiera longipetiolata</em> or <em>Solanum guamense</em>
 in the CNMI; therefore, they are not a threat to these two species. 
Feral pigs are noticeably absent from Rota, the only island in CNMI 
where 10 of the proposed 14 plants, and the fragile tree snail, occur.</p>
          <p id="p-447" data-page="59482">
            <em>Our Response:</em> Our own records and information, and 
thus this final rule, are in agreement with DLNR's comment regarding the
 specific islands in the CNMI occupied by feral pigs. However, we 
consider pigs a threat to populations of both <em>Heritiera longipetiolata</em> and <em>Solanum guamense</em> outside of the CNMI on the island of Guam, where these plant species and pigs do co-occur (see Table 3, Table 4, and <em>Factor A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range,</em> above.</p>
          <p id="p-448" data-page="59482">(53) <em>Comment:</em> The CNMI DLNR stated that water buffalo do not occur in the CNMI.</p>
          <p id="p-449" data-page="59482">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We agree. Our proposed rule identified water buffalo as a potential threat only on the island of Guam.</p>
          <p id="p-450" data-page="59482">(54) <em>Comment:</em> The 
CNMI DLNR stated that feral cattle are present only on Alamagan and 
Pagan within the CNMI. Feral cattle could potentially represent a threat
 to the humped tree snail and Slevin's skink. <em>Heritiera longipetiolata</em> is not reported to occur on Alamagan or Pagan, so feral cattle are not a threat to <em>Heritiera longipetiolata</em> in the CNMI.</p>
          <p id="p-451" data-page="59482">
            <em>Our Response:</em> The best available data indicate that
 feral cattle occur on the islands of Alamagan and Pagan in the CNMI. 
Although the proposed rule cites the presence of feral cattle also on 
the island of Tinian, new information provided by the CNMI DLNR suggests
 that feral cattle are no longer present on Tinian. Feral domestic 
cattle have roamed Tinian for the past few centuries, which resulted in 
substantial changes to the landscape by means of erosion, grazing, and 
trampling (Wiles <em>et al.</em> 1990, pp. 167-199; NRCS 2014, in 
litt.). Presently, however, the number of feral cattle on Tinian is 
considered negligible, if any exist at all. Cattle ranching is on the 
rise on Tinian, and cattle may become a threat on Tinian in the future. 
We have removed feral cattle as a threat to species that occur on Tinian
 (see Summary of Changes from the Proposed Rule, above). However, we 
maintain our position that feral cattle are present on Pagan, and are a 
threat to the humped tree snail, Slevin's skink, and tentatively to <em>Cycas micronesica.</em>

          <p id="p-452" data-page="59482">(55) <em>Comment:</em> The 
CNMI DLNR commented that feral goats are present on Agrihan, Pagan, 
Alamagan, and Aguiguan in the CNMI, and could be considered a threat to 
four of the proposed animals: Pacific sheath-tailed bat, Slevin's skink,
 humped tree snail, and Langford's tree snail.</p>
          <p id="p-453" data-page="59482">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We appreciate the confirmation 
regarding the threat from goats to the species addressed in this final 
rule present on the islands of Agrihan, Pagan, Alamagan, and Aguiguan. <em>Cycas micronesica</em> is likely present on Pagan as well, in which case goats will also negatively impact this species.</p>
          <p id="p-454" data-page="59482">(56) <em>Comment:</em> The 
CNMI DLNR states that the brown treesnake is not established on Rota, or
 on any other island in the CNMI and is, therefore, not an existing 
threat to the species in the CNMI. Further, interdiction of snakes from 
Guam continues to be addressed in the CNMI through a robust brown 
treesnake program active on Rota, Saipan, and Tinian. While it is 
possible that at some point in the future the brown treesnake may become
 established in the CNMI, the proposed rule itself does not consider the
 possibility of future establishment of invasive species such as goats.</p>
          <p id="p-455" data-page="59482">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We commend the brown treesnake 
program in the CNMI for their dedicated work toward preventing the 
establishment of the brown treesnake. We have concluded, however, that 
because the brown treesnake has been found on Saipan (Campbell 2014, 
pers. comm.; Phillips 2014, pers. comm.) and just recently on Rota as 
well (Phillips 2015, in litt.), the risk of the brown treesnake becoming
 established on one or more of the islands in the CNMI is high. We 
disagree that the likelihood of establishment for an invasive nonnative 
species such as a goat and brown treesnake are comparable, as brown 
treesnake are much smaller animals and can easily be accidentally 
transported in ships and planes; thus the possibility of accidental 
introduction is much greater.</p>
          <p id="p-456" data-page="59482">(57) <em>Comment:</em> The 
CNMI DLNR states that if the brown treesnake were to become established 
on Rota, it may impact the forest structure in the very long term if 
seed dispersers and pollinators are eliminated. However, the epiphytic 
orchids (<em>Bulbophyllum guamense, Dendrobium guamense,</em> and <em>Tuberolabium guamense</em>) were found to occur on many different host plants, and in the case of <em>B. guamense</em> and <em>D. guamense,</em> they were found on several introduced plant species. <em>Dendrobium guamense</em>
 was found on standing and fallen dead trees, and even on cliff faces. 
There is no evidence to suggest an eventual change in the forest 
structure would negatively impact these species.</p>
          <p id="p-457" data-page="59482">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We disagree. The best available 
scientific data indicate that if the brown treesnake were to establish 
on Rota, it would impact the forest structure by eliminating seed 
dispersers (Rogers 2008, in litt.; Rogers 2009, in litt.; Caves <em>et al.</em>
 2013, pp. 1-9). The actions of the brown treesnake indirectly alter 
forest structure, subsequently altering essential microclimates 
necessary to support species such as the four tree snails and <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59483"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59483" data-page="59483" data-text="Start Printed Page 59483" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59483}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59483</span></span></span>four
 orchids addressed in this final rule. The three epiphytic orchids 
occupy a highly specialized niche habitat that is easily disturbed. 
Raulerson and Rinehart (1992, p. 89) clearly state that, although the 
orchids in the Marianas appear abundant, their habitat range is limited,
 and in reality these orchids are very rare. Additionally, the brown 
treesnake has severely altered the forest structure on Guam (Rogers 
2008, in litt.; Rogers 2009, in litt.), where at minimum, 50 percent of 
the entire range exists for each of the four orchids addressed in this 
final rule.</p>
          <p id="p-458" data-page="59483">(58) <em>Comment:</em> The 
CNMI DLNR stated that the proposed rule gives information on nine of the
 nonnative plant species deemed to have the greatest negative impact on 
forest ecosystems, yet does not state how precisely these nonnative 
plants impact the proposed species, in particular the epiphytic orchids.</p>
          <p id="p-459" data-page="59483">
            <em>Our Response:</em> The proposed rule and this final rule
 outline how each of the nonnative plants impact native species, 
including the four orchids (see “Habitat Destruction and Modification by
 Nonnative Plants,” above). Examples provided include: Nonnative plants 
can form dense blankets that smother and outcompete native plants and 
animals; they can form dense tangled monostands that outcompete and 
crowd out native plants or negatively alter essential microclimates that
 support native animals and plants; nonnative plants can produce 
allelopathic effects or be able to occupy a more broad range of habitat 
types thus affording it an advantage; and nonnative plants can prevent 
the establishment of native plants. Orchid-specific examples include the
 potential to be smothered by nonnative vines (<em>e.g., Antigonon leptopus</em>) to the degree that they do not receive sunlight or block access from pollinators.</p>
          <p id="p-460" data-page="59483">(59) <em>Comment:</em> The CNMI DLNR commented that, while fires are common in grasslands on Rota, the species <em>Cycas micronesica, Dendrobium guamense,</em>
            <em>Maesa walkeri, Tabernaemontana rotensis,</em> and the humped tree snail are found in limestone forests, which generally are not impacted by fire, except at the forest edge.</p>
          <p id="p-461" data-page="59483">
            <em>Our Response:</em> Fires that occur on grasslands 
adjacent to the forest edge can directly impact individuals of the noted
 species that occupy the forest edge, as well as cause indirect impacts 
through continual encroachment of the grassland into the forest, thus 
decreasing the forested area and the habitat that supports these 
species. We consider fire a threat to these species on all of the 
islands where they are known to occur (see Table 3, Table 4, and Habitat
 Destruction and Modification by Fire, above).</p>
          <p id="p-462" data-page="59483">(60) <em>Comment:</em> The 
CNMI DLNR commented that they are unable to accept typhoons as a threat 
for any of the proposed species. Frequent and intense typhoons are a 
natural occurrence in the Mariana Islands. These species have all 
persisted in the Marianas despite many typhoons in the past. Typhoons 
per se are not a primary threat; however, if a species exists in limited
 numbers, then a typhoon may present an indirect threat.</p>
          <p id="p-463" data-page="59483">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We concur that typhoons are not a 
threat to native species with healthy and abundant populations, and we 
have modified the discussion of typhoons in this final rule to more 
accurately reflect this view. However, we do consider typhoons to pose a
 threat for the very reason identified by the DLNR: Because each of the 
23 species considered here have been reduced to limited numbers and 
range, or are decreasing at high rates (<em>i.e., Cycas micronesica</em>),
 they have become vulnerable to extirpation or extinction from natural 
disturbances such as typhoons. Due to the threats outlined in Table 3, 
these species and their associated natural habitats now lack the natural
 resiliency and redundancy they once had that enabled them to withstand 
such natural events.</p>
          <p id="p-464" data-page="59483">(61) <em>Comment:</em> The CNMI DLNR stated that the proposed rule claims that individuals of <em>Bulbophyllum guamense</em>
 that occur close to the coast in the adjacent forest ecosystem at or 
near sea level may be negatively impacted by sea-level rise and coastal 
inundation; however, the Department's evidence indicates the species is 
found only at higher elevations, and thus would not be affected by 
sea-level rise.</p>
          <p id="p-465" data-page="59483">
            <em>Our Response:</em> Although we agree that the majority of individuals of <em>Bulbophyllum guamense</em> have been recorded at higher elevations, <em>B. guamense</em>
 is also known to occur along the coastlines at the Haputo Ecological 
Reserve Area, Ritidian Point, and Two-Lovers Point, on the island of 
Guam, and, therefore, we conclude that sea-level rise is a concern.</p>
          <p id="p-466" data-page="59483">(62) <em>Comment:</em> The 
CNMI DLNR provided an update to the protected conservation areas on both
 Rota and Saipan. There are three conservation areas on Rota, including 
the Sabana Wildlife Conservation Area, encompassing both the Sabana 
Heights and Talakhaya (added in 2007 through Rota Local Law 15-8); the 
Wedding Cake Wildlife Conservation Area (Rota Local Law 9-3); and the 
Mariana Crow Conservation Area, declared in 2014, which encompasses the 
former I-Chenchon Park (§ 85-30.4). On Saipan, there are six 
conservation areas. There are the four areas mentioned in the proposed 
rule; as well as two new conservation areas in Marpi, both deeded to 
DLNR in 2012, and include the Nightingale Reed-warbler Conservation Area
 and the Micronesian Megapode Conservation Area.</p>

            <em>Our Response:</em> We have revised this final rule to accurately reflect this information (see <em>Islands in the Mariana Archipelago</em> and Summary of Changes from the Proposed Rule, above. We support the goals and intent of all of CNMI's natural protected areas.</p>

CNMI DLNR commented that they acknowledge the presence of deer on Rota, 
but suggested there is no evidence of deer herbivory impacts on <em>Cycas micronesica, Heritiera longipetiolata,</em> or <em>Solanum guamense.</em> The Department further disagreed with the claim that mammalian herbivory by deer and pigs contributes to the decline of <em>Solanum guamense</em> based upon the prevalence of <em>Solanum torvum</em> on Tinian, and the fact that leaves and green fruits of plants of the <em>Solanum</em> genus are often toxic to livestock.</p>
          <p id="p-469" data-page="59483">
            <em>Our Response:</em> As noted in Table 4 of this final rule, deer are identified as a threat on the islands of Guam and Rota. The <em>Solanum</em> genus contains more than 1,500 species, many of which are edible by animals, including <em>S. tuberosum</em> (potato), <em>S. melongena</em> (eggplant), <em>S. Arcanum</em> (wild tomato), and <em>Solanum nelsonii,</em>
 endemic to Hawaii and eaten by deer, rats, and cattle (USFWS 2014, in 
litt.). Furthermore, according to our sources (Wheeler 1979, pp. 1-51; 
Wiles <em>et al.</em> 1999, pp. 193-215; Perlman and Wood 1994, p. 152; 
Rogers 2012, in litt.; Wiles 2012, in litt.; Marler 2014, in litt.) and 
as reflected in Table 4, the impacts of deer and other ungulate 
herbivory upon <em>Cycas micronesica, Heritiera longipetiolata,</em> and <em>Solanum guamense</em> have been observed on the islands of Rota or Guam, where these plants co-occur with deer and pigs.</p>

            <em>Our Response:</em> We acknowledge that we do not have 
direct evidence of slug herbivory specific to the four orchid species

 throughout the world (Hamom 1995, pp. 45-46; Hollingsworth and Sewake 
2002, pp. -2; Joe and Daehler 2008, pp. 245-255) and of a variety of 
plants on Rota (Badilles <em>et al.</em> 2010, pp. 2-7; Cook 2012, in

 and their known habitat of consuming orchids, we believe it is 
reasonable to conclude that slug herbivory is a threat to the four

            <em>Our Response:</em> We appreciate receiving the Department's assessment of the threats to the tree snails that we are listing via this final rule.</p>
          <p id="p-476" data-page="59484">(67) <em>Comment:</em> The 
CNMI Department of Land and Natural Resources challenged the claim that 
current regulatory mechanisms in place in the CNMI are modestly enforced
 and are currently inadequate to protect the 16 (sic) CNMI species.</p>
          <p id="p-477" data-page="59484">
            <em>Our Response:</em> The proposed rule and this final rule
 identify the spread of nonnative plants and animals as the primary 
example as to why we consider CNMI regulations to be modestly enforced 
and inadequate. After receiving comments on the proposed rule, we have 
added that a paucity of funding availability and human resources hinders
 the enforcement of regulations (CNMI DLNR-Rota 2015, in litt.). We 
acknowledge that addressing the magnitude and intensity of harmful 
nonnative species (<em>e.g.,</em> brown treesnakes, aulacaspis scale, flatworms, and plants such as <em>Chromolaena odorata</em>)
 and their continual spread in the Marianas is a daunting and 
challenging task. However, this ongoing problem indicates that existing 
regulatory mechanisms have not curbed the impact or spread of these 
species. Therefore, current regulatory mechanisms are considered 
inadequate at this time.</p>
          <p id="p-478" data-page="59484">(68) <em>Comment:</em> The 
CNMI DLNR concurred that limited numbers is a threat for the Rota blue 
damselfly, Langford's tree snail, and fragile tree snail. However, the 
Department noted that the threat of limited numbers for the fragile tree
 snail is listed in Table 3, but is not included in the description of 
threats.</p>
          <p id="p-479" data-page="59484">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We have corrected this oversight in 
the text of this final listing rule (see Table 3 and Summary of Changes 
from the Proposed Rule, above).</p>
          <p id="p-480" data-page="59484">(69) <em>Comment:</em> The CNMI DLNR is unaware of any vandalism ever occurring on Rota targeting <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis</em> and suggested that the only reason why vandals might specifically target <em>T. rotensis,</em> or any particular species, would be its current or proposed status under the Act.</p>
          <p id="p-481" data-page="59484">
            <em>Our Response:</em> Vandalism of federally listed plant 
populations is well-documented across the United States, and there was 
an occurrence of vandalism to <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis</em> in the late 1990s (Hess and Pratt 2006, p. 33). However, we have concluded that vandalism is not an imminent threat to <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis</em>
 since there have been no documented occurrences since that time and 
have, therefore, removed this threat for this species from Table 3 and 
Factor E, above.</p>
          <p id="p-482" data-page="59484">(70) <em>Comment:</em> The CNMI DLNR stated that they have no evidence of ordnance directly impacting <em>Cycas micronesica</em> or <em>Heritiera longipetiolata</em>
 in the CNMI. The Department stated that, while ordnance use may be a 
potential threat on Pagan and Tinian in the future, they did not believe
 ordnance is a current or potential threat on any other island in the 
CNMI.</p>
          <p id="p-483" data-page="59484">
            <em>Our Response:</em> Our information regarding current and future planned military activity on Guam and within the CNMI indicate that <em>Cycas micronesica</em> and <em>Heritiera longipetiolata</em> are at risk of likely impacts from ordnance on the islands of Guam and Tinian, respectively. Damage to both <em>C. micronesica</em> and <em>H. longipetiolata</em> by ordnance and live-fire has been observed near a firing range on Andersen AFB (Guam DAWR 2013, in litt.).</p>
          <p id="p-484" data-page="59484">(71) <em>Comment:</em> The CNMI DLNR reported a new occurrence for <em>Dendrobium guamense</em> with three individuals of <em>Dendrobium guamense</em> observed on the island of Aguiguan.</p>
          <p id="p-485" data-page="59484">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We have updated this final rule to 
include Aguiguan within the range of this species (see Description of 
the 23 Mariana Islands Species, Table 1, and Summary of Changes from the
 Proposed Rule, above).</p>
          <p id="p-486" data-page="59484">(72) <em>Comment:</em> The 
CNMI DLNR reported a new occurrence for the Rota blue damselfly in a 
separate stream not used for water consumption on Rota, and commented 
that this second occurrence suggests the threat of water extraction is 
not as severe as stated in the proposed rule. The Department recommended
 that all streams of the Talakhaya region of Rota be surveyed for the 
damselfly in order to determine the full distribution of this species. 
Additionally, the Department noted that surveys should be conducted 
along streams on Saipan and the Talofofo watershed on Guam.</p>
          <p id="p-487" data-page="59484">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We have added this new occurrence 
information under Description of the 23 Mariana Islands Species and 
Summary of Changes from the Proposed Rule, above. We agree with the 
Department that additional surveys for the damselfly are desirable and 
would enhance our understanding of this species' status and biology. 
However, under the Act, we are required to make listing determinations 
on the basis of the best available scientific and commercial data 
available (see <a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=16&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1533&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">16 U.S.C. 1533</a>(a)(1)
 and (b)(1)(A)). While we appreciate learning of the new occurrence, the
 observation of a single additional individual is not sufficient to 
change our conclusion that the threat of water extraction is any less. 
The fact remains that the vast majority of known individuals 
representing the entire species is found on a stream that is used for 
water consumption on Rota, and thus this factor remains a significant 
threat.</p>
          <p id="p-488" data-page="59484">(73) <em>Comment:</em> The 
CNMI DLNR stated that they had not seen much public engagement, 
education or outreach for the community of Rota with regard to the 
proposed rule. They noted that the Service came to the DLNR office for a
 2-day visit, but expressed the opinion that this was not sufficient for
 a rulemaking that would create a great impact on cultural, social, 
economic, <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59485"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59485" data-page="59485" data-text="Start Printed Page 59485" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59485}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59485</span></span></span>and environmental resources in the future.</p>
          <p id="p-489" data-page="59485">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We regret that the CNMI DLNR feels 
our outreach efforts have been insufficient. The Service initiated 
communication regarding this rulemaking with the CNMI DLNR starting as 
early as spring 2012, including the Secretary and supervisory biologist.
 The CNMI DLNR supervisory biologist assisted our biologists in the 
field on Saipan during July 2012 and was invited to review and comment 
on their survey trip report (Harrington <em>et al.</em> 2012, in litt.),
 which included not only the 14 plants listed in this final rule, but 17
 additional plants that were considered for conservation actions at that
 time. Similarly, the CNMI DLNR Division of Fish and Wildlife on Rota 
collaborated with our field biologists in 2012, and were also asked to 
review and comment on the plant species. Our biologists also met with 
the CNMI DLNR Division of Forestry on Rota in 2012 to discuss the status
 of 31 Mariana Islands plant species considered for conservation 
actions.</p>
          <p id="p-490" data-page="59485">In November 2012, our Deputy 
Field Supervisor—Programmatic Division and Acting Deputy Field 
Supervisor—Geographic Program had a meeting each with the Secretary of 
CNMI DLNR and the Mayor of Rota, in which the potential listing of these
 species was mentioned. In June 2013, they met with the Secretary and 
Mayor of Rota again, and provided a briefing paper regarding the 23 
species. In January of 2014, our Acting Deputy Field 
Supervisor—Geographic Program, along with several staff biologists, met 
with the Mayor of Saipan, the Mayor of Tinian, and the Mayor of Rota 
along with the Rota Division of Fish and Wildlife and Division of 
Forestry, specifically to discuss the 23 species. In May 2014, prior to 
the publication of the proposed rule, we held two public information 
meetings, one each on Guam and Saipan, in order to inform the public and
 answer questions about the 23 species and listing process. Also in May 
2015, our Field Supervisor and Deputy Field Supervisor—Programmatic 
Division and Acting Deputy Field Supervisor—Geographic Program briefed 
the CNMI Legislature, and met with the CNMI DLNR on Saipan, to discuss 
the status of the 23 species, answer questions, and gain information on 
one or more of the 23 species and conservation issues. In July 2014, our
 Field Supervisor and Deputy Field Supervisor—Programmatic Division met 
with the Legislative Representative from Rota regarding the orchids. 
Upon the publication of the proposed rule (October 1, 2014), we 
published news releases in the Marianas Variety, Marianas Variety Guam, 
and Pacific Daily News.</p>

          <p id="p-491" data-page="59485">Due to requests received 
during the first comment period, we reopened the comment period for an 
additional 30 days (January 12, 2015, through February 11, 2015); and in
 January 2015, held two public hearings (one each on Guam and Saipan), 
and four public information meetings (one each on the islands of Guam, 
Rota, Saipan, and Tinian). The public information meeting on Rota had 11
 attendees. Additionally, most of the species addressed in this final 
rule that occur on Rota are found within existing conservation 
boundaries or designated critical habitat. Any future targeted 
conservation measures on Rota will likely occur within these areas and, 
therefore, minimize impacts to the local community. Further, once a 
species is listed, for private or other non-Federal property owners we 
offer voluntary safe harbor agreements that can contribute to the 
recovery of species, habitat conservation plans (HCP) that allow 
activities (<em>e.g.,</em> grazing) to proceed while minimizing effects 
to species, funding through the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program 
to help promote conservation actions, and grants to the States under 
section 6 of the Act. Overall, the Service has attempted to inform and 
engage the community of Rota to the extent possible, and we look forward
 to continue working with the CNMI DLNR and the members of the local 
community for the conservation of native species on Rota.</p>
          <p id="p-492" data-page="59485">(74) <em>Comment:</em> The 
CNMI DLNR submitted comment with the suggestion that the Endangered 
Species Act (the Act) be modified to accommodate different situations 
because it believes the way the ESA is currently written and applied is 
limited by its one-size-fits-all approach.</p>
          <p id="p-493" data-page="59485">
            <em>Our Response:</em> Changing the Act requires a legislative action by the United States Congress and is beyond the scope of this listing action.</p>
          <p id="p-494" data-page="59485">(75) <em>Comment:</em> A 
member of the CNMI Legislature commented that the CNMI is slowly 
rebounding from a slow and weakened economy, and that they are faced 
with significant economic challenges. In order to address these issues, 
the Government approved a series of proposed developments that include 
the construction of 2,000-plus integrated casino resorts at various 
locations yet to be determined, themed entertainment facilities, 
beverage outlets, villas, chapels, and sports facilities that are to be 
built at other locations. This commenter stated that it is inevitable 
that listing species for protection and conservation will place 
stumbling blocks for economic prosperity for the people of the 
Commonwealth.</p>
          <p id="p-495" data-page="59485">
            <em>Our Response:</em> The Act requires that our listing 
determinations be based solely on the best scientific and commercial 
data available. The Act does not allow us to consider the impacts of 
listing on economics or human activities whether over the short term, 
long term, or cumulatively.</p>
          <p id="p-496" data-page="59485">(76) <em>Comment:</em> Two 
commenters, the CNMI DLNR and a representative of the CNMI legislature, 
commented that the Service must provide the financial resources to 
effectively carry out and enforce Federal conservation programs in the 
CNMI. This added task, absent financial support, is counterproductive. 
The CNMI DLNR is understaffed and underfunded. The representative from 
the Legislature further commented that Federal conservation programs in 
the CNMI are being hampered due to being understaffed and no or 
under-appropriated Federal financial support; and, therefore, the 
Service should not depend solely on data collected from the CNMI DLNR 
Division of Fish and Wildlife.</p>
          <p id="p-497" data-page="59485">
            <em>Our Response:</em> The Service does not solely rely on 
any one source to inform our proposals or to make a determination. We 
rely on the best scientific and commercial data available at the time of
 our decision; that data may come in many forms and from multiple 
sources. In this case, we have relied on peer-reviewed published 
articles, unpublished research, habitat modeling reports, digital data 
publicly available on the Internet, and the expert opinions from 
specialized biologists to determine the status of the 23 species. 
Regarding funding, the Service provides funding to CNMI DLNR and other 
local conservation programs such as the brown treesnake program, and 
pending our future budget, which changes annually, we intend to allocate
 funds to assist with actions that aim to recover the 23 species 
addressed in this final rule. The funding of the CNMI DLNR is outside 
the scope of this rulemaking.</p>
          <p id="p-498" data-page="59485">(77) <em>Comment:</em> A 
representative from the CNMI legislature and one public commenter stated
 that it was difficult to navigate the methods provided to the public to
 make a comment. The Web sites and addresses are long and confusing, 
technology is limited in many areas of the CNMI, and small community 
voices likely will not be heard. People would like to comment, but do 
not understand how or where, or even what impacts would result from the 
listing of the 23 species. People also do not understand how these

            <em>Our Response:</em> Please see our response to comment 
(73), above, where we outline the multiple public information meetings 
held to inform the public and answer questions. At all of these 
meetings, we provided contact information, information about the 23 
species (including pictures), and explained why they were being 
considered for listing as threatened or endangered species. We also had 
biologists present to explain the listing process and answer questions 
to members of the public. The public information meetings held in 
January 2015 on Guam, Saipan, Rota, and Tinian were held during the 
second open comment period, and we accepted written comments at those 
meetings. We also held public hearings, at which members of the public 
could present their comments orally if they preferred to do so. We have 
provided multiple opportunities to inform the public, answer their 
questions, and submit comments regarding the proposed rule. We always 
appreciate feedback on how we can improve our outreach efforts.</p>
          <p id="p-500" data-page="59486">(78) <em>Comment:</em> A 
representative of the CNMI legislature and a public commenter requested 
that the Service separate out the 16 plants and animals that were not 
previously candidate species, and assign them a totally different 
process, and only move on with the 7 candidate species at this time. 
CNMI biologists have conducted surveys that found there are many more 
individuals of some species than what was stated in the proposed rule. 
More research is needed to determine whether or not the additional 16 
species warrant listing.</p>
          <p id="p-501" data-page="59486">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We included the additional 16 species
 in this listing package for the sake of efficiency and saving taxpayer 
dollars. We evaluated these species under the same standards and with 
the same rigor outlined in the ESA that we apply to all species under 
consideration for listing, whether previous candidates or not. Under the
 Act, we determine whether a species is an endangered species or a 
threatened species because of any of five factors, and we are required 
to make listing determinations solely on the basis of the best available
 scientific and commercial data <em>available</em> [emphasis ours] 
(sections 4(a)(1) and 4(b)(1)(A)). Further, our Policy on Information 
Standards under the Act (published in the <strong>Federal Register</strong>
 on July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34271)), the Information Quality Act (section 
515 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal
 Year 2001 (<a class="publ external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=plaw&amp;congress=106&amp;lawtype=public&amp;lawnum=554&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">Pub.

 provide criteria and guidance, and establish procedures to ensure that 
our decisions are based on the best scientific data available. They 
require our biologists, to the extent consistent with the Act and with 
the use of the best scientific and commercially available data, to use 
primary and original sources of information as the basis for 
recommendations to list a species.</p>
          <p id="p-502" data-page="59486">In accordance with our peer 
review policy published on July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34270), we solicited peer
 review from knowledgeable individuals with scientific expertise that 
included familiarity with the species, the geographic region in which 
the species occurs, and conservation biology principles. Additionally, 
we requested comments or information from other concerned governmental 
agencies, the scientific community, industry, and any other interested 
parties concerning the proposed rule. Comments and information we 
received helped inform this final rule. We have incorporated all new 
information, including the studies conducted by CNMI DLNR biologists, 
under Description of the 23 Mariana Islands Species and Summary of 
Biological Status and Threats Affecting the 23 Mariana Islands Species, 
above; and we discuss our rationale for retaining the species that are 
more abundant than previously described in the proposed rule under 
Summary of Changes from the Proposed Rule, above. Therefore, in this 
final rule, we have made our determination to list the 23 species as 
threatened or endangered species based on the best scientific and 
commercial data available.</p>

          <p id="p-504" data-page="59486">(79) <em>Comment:</em> A 
representative of the CNMI legislature expressed concern that more land 
on Rota will be set aside if the listings are finalized, especially due 
to the recent large piece of public land set aside on Rota to mitigate 
for the Mariana crow that is listed as endangered. Additionally, there 
was a recent Federal law passed by Congress authorizing a feasibility 
study for a National Park monument on Rota.</p>
          <p id="p-505" data-page="59486">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We understand that there is concern 
about the potential consequences following the listing of these 23 
species. However, the direct effect of this rulemaking is limited to 
placing these 23 species on the Federal Lists of Endangered and 
Threatened Wildlife and Plants, which in turn affords them protections 
under sections 7 and 9 of the Federal Endangered Species Act . The 
listing of these species does not carry with it any automatic 
requirement that additional land be set aside on Rota for the purposes 
of conservation. Should the listing of these species initiate some 
interest by the local government or some other entity in potentially 
setting aside some additional lands for conservation, such an action 
would entail an entirely separate endeavor and legal process from this 
rulemaking.</p>

U.S. National Park Service (NPS) commented that they concur with the 
proposed rule to add these 23 species to the Federal Lists of Endangered
 and Threatened Wildlife and Plants. Of the 23 species, the NPS 
Monitoring and Inventory Program and War in the Pacific National 
Historical Park (NHP) staff have recently found three plant species 
present on park land on Guam (<em>Cycas micronesica, Tinospora homosepala,</em> and <em>Phyllanthus saffordii</em>). Also, they suggest that the plant <em>Hedyotis megalantha</em>
 is probably present in the park as the park contains appropriate 
habitat that is likely supporting the occurrence of that species. A 
small population of the Guam tree snail is also present in at least one 
site in the park. The humped tree snail has been recorded recently in 
American Memorial Park on Saipan.</p>
          <p id="p-507" data-page="59486">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We appreciate being informed

three plants and Guam tree snail at War in the Pacific NHP on Guam, and 
the presence of the humped tree snail at American Memorial Park on 
Saipan, were included in our analyses published in the proposed rule. 
The NPS participated in meetings with the Service and other Federal and

on Andersen Air Force Base-Northwest Field. Orote Point, Pati Point, and
 Navy Barrigada are not preferred locations for any facilities to 
support the Marine Corps move. Andersen South and the Naval Magazine

            <em>Our Response:</em> We have incorporated all new relevant
 data for the humped tree snail and Guam tree snail under Description of
 the 23 Mariana Islands Species and Summary of Biological Status and 
Threats Affecting the 23 Mariana Islands Species, above.</p>
          <p id="p-516" data-page="59487">(85) <em>Comment:</em> The 
U.S. Navy commented that, in the section titled Habitat Destruction and 
Modification by Development, Military Training, and Urbanization, the 
proposed rule states that the northern two-thirds of Tinian are leased 
by the Department of Defense, and the development of these lands and 
effects from live-fire training will directly impact the trees <em>Heritiera longipetiolata</em> (on Tinian) and <em>Cycas micronesica</em>
 (on Pagan) and their habitat in the forest ecosystem. The Navy concurs 
that there may be an impact during construction, dependent on the 
location of ranges and the distribution of <em>H. longipetiolata</em> (Tinian) and <em>C. micronesica</em>
 (Pagan). However, they believe it is unlikely that live-fire training 
will impact these species since the ordnance or small-arms will be 
directed into cleared impact areas. The same comment applies to the 
humped tree snail and Slevin's skink on Pagan; both are forest species, 
and only forest clearing (if needed for range construction) may impact 
them.</p>
          <p id="p-517" data-page="59487">
            <em>Our Response:</em> One of the primary threats to each of
 the 23 species in the proposed rule is land clearing that results in 
direct loss of habitat. We maintain our position regarding threats 
associated with live-fire training for the above-mentioned species, as 
the risk of direct damage from ricocheted bullets and misplaced ordnance
 cannot be eliminated, nor can the associated risk of fire. Direct 
damage resulting from live-fire training has been observed in the past 
to individuals of <em>Heritiera longipetiolata</em> and <em>Cycas micronesica</em>
 at the firing range adjacent to Tarague Beach, on Andersen Air Force 
Base, Guam (GDAWR 2013, pers. comm.). Further, the direct trampling of 
individuals and destruction of habitat from military personnel remain 
threats to the above species. New information received during the first 
comment period informed us that the humped tree snail has recently been 
documented on Tinian. Therefore, land clearing and live-fire training 
are also a threat to the humped tree snail on Tinian (see Description of
 the 23 Mariana Islands Species, above, and Summary of Changes from the 
Proposed Rule, above). The Service looks forward to further 
collaboration with the DOD to develop strategies that simultaneously 
support the DOD's mission-critical activities and avoid or minimize 
impacts to listed, proposed, and candidate species, and their habitats.</p>
          <p id="p-518" data-page="59487">(86) <em>Comment:</em> The 
U.S. Navy commented that, in the section titled “Habitat Destruction and
 Modification by Introduced Ungulates,” the proposed rule does not 
report three epiphytic orchids (<em>Bulbophyllum guamense, Dendrobium guamense,</em> and <em>Tuberolabium guamense</em>), the vine <em>Tinospora homosepala,</em> the Mariana wandering butterfly and its host plant <em>Maytenus thompsonii,</em>
 and the Rota blue damselfly to be vulnerable to habitat modification 
and destruction caused by nonnative ungulates. They point out that 
ungulates on Guam have modified the current forest ecosystem, resulting 
in minimal regeneration of native tree species, including those that are
 hosts for the epiphytic orchids and butterflies; impacts from ungulates
 would be expected to impact these species.</p>
          <p id="p-519" data-page="59487">
            <em>Our Response:</em> When species face myriad threats, we 
focus on those that pose the greatest risk to the species. Although the 
cumulative scientific literature confirms the negative impacts on 
ecosystems resulting from nonnative ungulates, we have no evidence at 
this time to support assigning nonnative ungulates as a threat to the 
three epiphytic orchids, nor the Mariana wandering butterfly and its 
host plant <em>Maytenus thompsonii.</em> The Service exercises caution 
when assigning a threat to a species. The three epiphytic orchids often 
occur high up in the canopy far from the reach of ungulates, and the 
tree <em>Maytenus thompsonii</em> does not yet appear to be impacted by 
ungulates to the degree that we would consider the Marianas wandering 
butterfly to be threatened by ungulates.</p>

 We assume the firing range referenced is Combat Arms Training and 
Maintenance (CATM)]), JRM has not received any reports of damage to 
these or any other proposed species in areas at or adjacent to the CATM 
Range from training activities at this site. JRM conducted a survey of 
the CATM Range on October 30, 2014, to assess the presence and relative 
abundance of proposed species and to search for signs of impact from 
activities at the range. <em>Cycas micronesica</em> was present at all 
areas searched, with abundance ranging from 1individual to approximately
 50 at each site. No evidence of range-related damage was observed to 
individuals of <em>C. micronesica,</em> including no signs of damage from ricochet bullets to cycads or other vegetation at any sites. <em>Heritiera longipetiolata</em>
 was not observed at any sites. Considering the observed abundance of 
the species proposed for listing, the absence of signs of damage from 
range activities, and the type of training that occurs at the range, 
impacts from activities at the CATM Range (including ricochet bullets) 
it is not expected to present a significant threat to the species 
proposed for listing. This finding is expected to also apply to other 
ranges that currently exist on Guam due to the similar type of training 
that occurs at these ranges.</p>
          <p id="p-521" data-page="59488">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We appreciate the Navy's investigation into the threat from live-fire weapons to <em>Heritiera longipetiolata</em> and <em>Cycas micronesica</em>
 near Tarague Beach, and the recent update that live-fire is not 
negatively impacting these species as described in the proposed rule. 
The Service has taken this comment into consideration and has omitted 
Tarague Beach from the sites where live-fire training and ordnance are 
considered to negatively impact these two plant species. However, due to
 the preferred site for the new live-fire range on Northwest Field on 
Andersen AFB over the Guam National Wildlife Refuge, and the associated 
proposed training activities on Pagan and Tinian, the Service concludes 
that DOD ordnance and live-fire training remain a threat to these two 
previously mentioned plant species (<em>Cycas micronesica</em> (Northwest Field Andersen AFB) and <em>Heritiera longipetiolata</em>
 (Tinian)), and has been added as a threat to the humped tree snail and 
Slevin's skink, also addressed in this final rule, because they occur on
 Pagan where live-fire training is planned as described in the CNMI 
Joint Military Training Draft EIS/OEIS (<em><a date="10/01/2015" href="http://www.cnmijointmilitarytrainingeis.com/about">http://www.cnmijointmilitarytrainingeis.com/​about</a></em>). Additionally, the plants <em>Psychotria malaspinae</em> and <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis</em>
 and the Mariana eight-spot butterfly occur within the suggested 
boundaries of the live-fire training area on the Northwest Field on 
Andersen Air Force Base (USFWS 2015, in litt.) and, therefore, are being
 assigned the threat from live-fire training and ordnance.</p>

          <p id="p-522" data-page="59488">Other threats to these seven 
species, and their habitats, associated with DOD live-fire training 
include direct destruction by land clearing, live-fire weapons training 
and possible fires caused by this activity, or inadvertent trampling and
 destruction by military personnel. The threat from live-fire training 
and ordnance to the plants <em>Cycas micronesica, Heritiera longipetiolata,</em> and <em>P. malaspinae,</em> and <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis</em>
 and the humped tree snail, Marianas eight-spot butterfly, and Slevin's 
skink, listed as threatened or endangered in this final rule, has been 
added to Table 3 and Summary of Biological Status and Threats Affecting 
the 23 Mariana Islands Species, above. These changes are also noted 
under Summary of Changes from the Proposed Rule, above.</p>
          <p id="p-523" data-page="59488">(88) <em>Comment:</em> The 
U.S. Navy commented that the JRM INRMP uses an ecosystem approach to 
adaptively manage natural resources to protect native species, including
 federally listed endangered, threatened, and proposed species and their
 habitat. They describe the key components of ecosystem management in 
the INRMP as: (1) Control and eradication of ungulates (deer, pigs and 
carabao); (2) restoration and maintenance of native forests; and (3) 
control and eradication of brown treesnakes that will lead to the 
reintroduction of native forest birds and bats and restore native 
habitat. Long-term forest management plans specific to Andersen Air 
Force Base (AAFB) and Navy Base Guam (NBG) are under development for the
 Guam National Wildlife Refuge Overlay lands, including site-specific 
descriptions for the protection, restoration, and enhancement of native 
forest as well as eradication of invasive plants. The restoration of 
forest ecosystems will benefit the recovery of ESA-listed species and 
proposed species. They further state that funding has been programmed to
 support this work through 2020. For example, the INRMP program will 
erect fencing on Andersen Air Force Base and Navy Base Guam to exclude 
ungulates from native forest, eradicate ungulates within fenced areas, 
and maintain ungulate densities at near zero in non-fenced areas. So 
far, a 306-ac ungulate fence has been initiated on AAFB. Additionally, 
ungulate control on AAFB and NBG has been initiated, and eradication of 
ungulates in the fenced areas will be initiated in FY2015. In the 
Marianas, JRM lands include 53,709 terrestrial acres and 79,260 acres of
 submerged lands. Some of the most environmentally sensitive areas on 
Guam and in the CNMI, including habitat for proposed species, occur 
within these lands.</p>

            <em>Our Response:</em> We appreciate the update regarding

 U.S. Navy on AAFB and NBG and commend these efforts. We have added the 
new exclosure information under the section “Conservation Efforts to

Although the INRMP has not yet been approved by the Service, we have 
taken all of the information provided by these comments into 
consideration. We look forward to collaborating with the DOD to further 
these conservation efforts in the Mariana Islands, and we are continuing
 to coordinate with the U.S. Navy on the development of their INRMP.</p>
          <p id="p-525" data-page="59488">(89) <em>Comment:</em> The 
U.S. Navy commented that the JRM INRMP program is funding research for 
large-scale suppression and eradication of brown treesnakes. In FY 2014,
 the Navy funded $1.8M in projects to meet objectives for control, 
suppression, and eradication of brown treesnakes to benefit native 
species (including proposed species) and their habitat. Funding has been
 programmed to continue this effort through 2021. Additionally, in FY 
2014 the Navy funded $3.3M for control and containment to prevent the 
spread and establishment of brown treesnakes to new areas, including the
 CNMI where species in this rulemaking action occur.</p>

            <em>Our Response:</em> The eradication of brown treesnakes 
from Guam is a priority of the Service, as well as preventing the spread
 and establishment of brown treesnakes elsewhere, and the Service

within the plots are actively managed to ensure health and survival;

          <h4 id="h-93">Public Comments on the Proposed Listing of 23 Species</h4>
          <p id="p-531" data-page="59489">(92) <em>Comment:</em> Two 
commenters agreed that all 23 species face threats of high magnitude and
 imminence, and that the cumulative impacts on these species will take a
 heavy toll on their ability to adapt and survive. One of the commenters
 suggested that human population growth and a rising tourism industry 
will further hinder the ability to control invasive species. Further, 
they stated that, although the brown treesnake may not yet be found in 
the northern Mariana Islands, the military expansion into these islands 
will undoubtedly spread the invasion of this species. Further, they 
suggested that the economic and environmental roles the 23 species play 
in the ecosystem cannot be overlooked. The current rate of species 
extinctions is more than 1,000 times greater than the background rate 
calculated from the fossil record and genetic data that spans millions 
of years (Pimm <em>et al.</em> 2014).</p>
          <p id="p-532" data-page="59489">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We appreciate the concurrence 
regarding our analysis for each of the 23 species, and we recognize the 
threat posed by the potential spread of the brown treesnake onto islands
 where it does not yet occur. The Act requires us to make listing 
decisions based solely on the best scientific and commercial data 
available; considerations such as the potential economic role of a 
species in an ecosystem cannot enter into a listing determination.</p>
          <p id="p-533" data-page="59489">(93) <em>Comment:</em> Several
 commenters expressed concern that more listing of endangered species 
will prevent landowners from building on their own property. One of 
these commenters stated that the Fish and Wildlife Service said he could
 not cut down trees or build a home on his family's property due to the 
presence of the nightingale reed-warbler (listed as an endangered 
species). The commenters suggested propagating species to increase their
 populations as an alternative to listing, and questioned why existing 
mitigation lands are not sufficient to conserve these species.</p>
          <p id="p-534" data-page="59489">
            <em>Our Response:</em> Programs are available to private 
landowners to assist with managing habitat for listed species, as well 
as provide permits to protect private landowners from the take 
prohibition when such taking is incidental to, and not the purpose of, 
the carrying out of an otherwise lawful activity (<em>e.g.,</em> habitat
 conservation plans (HCP) and safe harbor agreements (SHA)). Private 
landowners may contact their local Service field office to obtain 
information about these programs and permits. The Service believes that 
restrictions alone are neither an effective nor a desirable means for 
achieving the conservation of listed species. We are committed to 
working collaboratively with private landowners, and strongly encourage 
individuals with listed species on their property to work with us to 
develop incentive-based measures such as SHAs or HCPs, which have the 
potential to provide conservation measures that effect positive results 
for the species and its habitat while providing regulatory relief for 
landowners. The conservation and recovery of endangered and threatened 
species, and the ecosystems upon which they depend, is the ultimate 
objective of the Act, and the Service recognizes the vital importance of
 voluntary, nonregulatory conservation measures that provide incentives 
for landowners in achieving that objective.</p>
          <p id="p-535" data-page="59489">Regarding proactive measures 
for species of concern, the Service collaborates with and funds multiple
 programs that work on the propagation and outplanting of threatened and
 endangered plants and captive-breeding programs for threatened and 
endangered animals, as well as for candidate species. However, while we 
agree that such measures are often desirable and necessary to achieve 
the conservation of the species, the Act does not allow for the pursuit 
of such activities as an alternative to listing. The statute requires 
that we consider whether a species is endangered or threatened as a 
result of any of five threat factors, specifically: (A) The present or 
threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or 
range; (B) Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or 
educational purposes; (C) Disease or predation; (D) The inadequacy of 
existing regulatory mechanisms; or (E) Other natural or manmade factors 
affecting its continued existence. If we conclude that the species in 
question meets the definition of an endangered species or threatened 
species, then that species is listed and receives Federal protections 
under the Act. One component of these protections is the development of a
 recovery plan, which may employ the conservation measures suggested by 
the commenters, depending on the needs of the species. Additionally, 
although existing mitigation lands can be used for conservation actions,
 the availability of such lands may not be sufficient to offset the full
 suite of threats that are negatively affecting the species such that we
 would conclude listing is not warranted. For example, mitigation lands 
may not provide enough resources or be large enough in size to fully 
support the population sizes and distribution needed for long-term 
viability of a species, or the nature of the stressor may be such that 
mitigation lands do little to offset the threat (such as impacts from 
manokwari flatworm predation on native tree snails). Thus, while 
existing mitigation lands or conservation areas make an important 
contribution to the conservation of these species, they are not 
sufficient to address all of the threats leading to the determination 
that these species are endangered or threatened, as defined by the Act.</p>
          <p id="p-536" data-page="59489">(94) <em>Comment:</em> Several
 commenters stated that the proposed rule was based on a lawsuit rather 
than science. Additionally, one commenter expressed sincere disapproval 
of the ESA, primarily based on the resulting need <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59490"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59490" data-page="59490" data-text="Start Printed Page 59490" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59490}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59490</span></span></span>for permits and difficulty to delist species.</p>
          <p id="p-537" data-page="59490">
            <em>Our Response:</em> The timing of our proposed rule was 
based on a July 12, 2011, multiyear workplan filed as part of a 
settlement agreement with the Center for Biological Diversity and 
others, in a consolidated case in the U.S. District Court for the 
District of Columbia (In re Endangered Species Act Section 4 Deadline 
Litigation, No. 10-377 (EGS), MDL Docket No. 2165 (D.D.C. May 10, 2011),
 approved by the court on September 9, 2011). The settlement enables the
 Service to systematically, over a period of 6 years, review and address
 the needs of more than 250 candidate species to determine if they 
should be added to the Federal Lists of Endangered and Threatened 
Wildlife and Plants. Addressing the seven candidate species is part of 
this settlement agreement. However, it is important to note that these 
species were already candidates for listing prior to the settlement, and
 were added to the candidate list as a result of our earlier 
determination, based solely on the best scientific and commercial data 
available, that they meet the definition of endangered species or 
threatened species according to the Act. Section 4 of the Act and its 
implementing regulations (<a class="cfr external" href="https://www.federalregister.gov/select-citation/2015/10/01/50-CFR-424">50 CFR part 424</a>)
 set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal Lists of 
Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants. The listing process is 
not arbitrary, but uses the best available scientific and commercial 
data and peer-review in decisionmaking. In our proposed rule and this 
final rule, we have adhered to all statutory requirements in evaluating 
the status of the 23 species addressed here, the 7 original candidate 
species as well as 16 additional species native to the Marianas, and in 
making our determination that these species meet the definition of 
either endangered species or threatened species under the Act.</p>
          <p id="p-538" data-page="59490">The Service is fully committed
 to working with communities and private landowners in partnership to 
minimize any impacts that may potentially result from the listing of a 
species while achieving conservation goals. For example, the Service 
works with landowners to develop habitat conservation plans or safe 
harbor agreements, and provide permits to private landowners for taking a
 listed species when it is incidental to the carrying out of an 
otherwise lawful activity. Private landowners may contact their local 
Service field office to obtain information about these programs and 
permits. The Service believes that restrictions alone are neither an 
effective nor a desirable means for achieving the conservation of listed
 species. The conservation and recovery of endangered and threatened 
species, and the ecosystems upon which they depend, is the ultimate 
objective of the Act, and the Service recognizes the vital importance of
 voluntary, nonregulatory conservation measures that provide incentives 
for landowners in achieving that objective.</p>

          <p id="p-540" data-page="59490">(95) <em>Comment:</em> One 
commenter stated that the Service is proposing to double the number of 
listed species in the CNMI in one action. The commenter further stated 
that most people in the Marianas do not have the history or experience 
with the ESA listing process to be able to absorb the magnitude of the 
detailed scientific information contained in the proposed rule, and 
suggested the initial 60-day public comment period was insufficient to 
review all of the detailed information, including references cited, and 
provide comments.</p>
          <p id="p-541" data-page="59490">
            <em>Our Response:</em> We appreciate the concern regarding 
public understanding of the proposed rule. Public review and 
understanding is important to us, which is why we extended the initial 
public comment period by an additional 30 days, for a total of 90 days. 
We also held two public hearings (one each on Guam and Saipan) and four 
public information meetings (one each on Guam, Saipan, Rota, and Tinian)
 in January 2015. These public information meetings were provided 
specifically to address the concerns expressed by the commenter, and to 
ensure that the public had an opportunity to fully understand our 
proposal and engage in discussion or ask questions of Service staff. 
Please see our response to comment (73), above, for a detailed summary

          <p id="p-543" data-page="59490">
            <em>Our Response:</em> The 23 species designated as 
threatened or endangered species in this final rule are all species that
 occur in the Mariana Islands and nowhere else in the entire world, with
 the exception of <em>Cycas micronesica,</em> which is also found on Yap
 and in Palau. It is accurate that the statute requires determinations 
as to whether species merit the protections of the Act as an endangered 
species or threatened species be based solely on scientific and 
commercial data, as that data informs our evaluation of the threats 
affecting the species and their conservation status. However, the 
Service is fully committed to working with communities and private 
landowners in partnership to minimize any impacts that may potentially 
result from the listing of a species while achieving conservation goals.
 For example, the Service works with landowners to develop safe harbor

          <p id="p-547" data-page="59490">
            <em>Our Response:</em> The commenter did not provide 
information pertaining as to how or when these cycads were purportedly 
destroyed. Department of Defense lands often support many rare species 
because access is so limited and they establish relatively large buffer 
areas that are often left untouched. Thus, military actions can be 
beneficial to species and their habitats, but they can also be 
destructive to species and their habitats, as outlined under Summary of 
Biological Status and Threats Affecting the 23 Mariana Islands Species, 
above. All Federal agencies must consult with the Service, under section
 7 of the Act, prior to carrying out actions that may impact listed 
species. The Service provides suggestions to avoid or minimize impacts 
to species, and methods for mitigation when appropriate. In this 
particular case, as <em>Cycas micronesica</em> was not a candidate 
species prior to being proposed for listing as a threatened species in 
October 2014, the DOD was under no obligation to conserve this species 
or consult with the Service regarding the potential removal of <em>Cycas micronesica</em> trees.

 set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal Lists of 
Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants. Under section 4(a)(1) of 
the Act, we may list a species based on (A) The present or threatened 
destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range; (B) 
Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational
 purposes; (C) Disease or predation; (D) The inadequacy of existing

          <p id="p-549" data-page="59491">We have carefully assessed the
 best scientific and commercial information available regarding the 
past, present, and future threats to the 23 species listed as endangered
 or threatened species in this final rule. We find that all 23 species 
face threats that are ongoing and expected to continue into the future 
throughout their ranges from the present destruction and modification of
 their habitats from nonnative feral ungulates, rats, or nonnative 
plants (Factor A). Destruction and modification of habitat by 
development, military training, and urbanization is a threat to 13 of 
the 14 plant species (<em>Bulbophyllum guamense, Cycas micronesica, 
Dendrobium guamense, Eugenia bryanii, Hedyotis megalantha, Heritiera 
longipetiolata, Maesa walkeri, Nervilia jacksoniae, Phyllanthus 
saffordii, Psychotria malaspinae, Solanum guamense, Tabernaemontana 
rotensis,</em> and <em>Tuberolabium guamense</em>) and to 8 of the 9 
animal species (the Pacific sheath-tailed bat, Slevin's skink, the 
Mariana eight-spot butterfly, the Rota blue damselfly, the Guam tree 
snail, the humped tree snail, Langford's tree snail, and the fragile 
tree snail). Habitat destruction and modification from fire is a threat 
to nine of the plant species (<em>Bulbophyllum guamense, Cycas micronesica,</em>
            <em>Dendrobium guamense, Hedyotis megalantha,</em>
            <em>Maesa walkeri, Nervilia jacksoniae,</em>
            <em> Phyllanthus saffordii, Tabernaemontana rotensis,</em> and <em>Tuberolabium guamense</em>)
 and two tree snails (the Guam tree snail and the humped tree snail). 
Destruction and modification of habitat from typhoons is a threat to all
 23 species, which are vulnerable as a result of past reductions in 
population size and distribution. Rising temperatures and other effects 
of projected climate change may impact all 23 species, but there is 
limited information on the exact nature of impacts that these species 
may experience. Although the specific and cumulative effects of climate 
change on each of these 23 species are presently unknown, we anticipate 
that these effects, if realized, will exacerbate the current threats to 
these species (Factor A).</p>
          <p id="p-550" data-page="59491">Overcollection for commercial 
and recreational purposes poses a threat to all four tree snail species 
(the Guam tree snail, the humped tree snail, Langford's tree snail, and 
the fragile tree snail) (Factor B).</p>
          <p id="p-551" data-page="59491">Predation or herbivory on 9 of the 14 plant species (<em>Bulbophyllum
 guamense, Cycas micronesica, Dendrobium guamense, Eugenia bryanii, 
Heritiera longipetiolata, Nervilia jacksoniae, Psychotria malaspinae, 
Solanum guamense,</em> and <em>Tuberolabium guamense</em>) and 8 of the 9
 animals (all except the Rota blue damselfly) by feral pigs, deer, brown
 treesnakes, rats, monitor lizards, slugs, flatworms, ants, or wasps 
poses a serious and ongoing threat (Factor C).</p>
          <p id="p-552" data-page="59491">The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms (<em>i.e.,</em>
 inadequate protection of habitat and inadequate protection from the 
introduction of nonnative species) poses a serious and ongoing threat to
 all 23 species (Factor D).</p>

          <p id="p-553" data-page="59491">There are serious and ongoing threats to three plant species (<em>Psychotria malaspinae, Solanum guamense,</em> and <em>Tinospora homosepala</em>),
 the fragile tree snail, Guam tree snail, Langford's tree snail, Mariana
 eight-spot butterfly, Mariana wandering butterfly, Pacific 
sheath-tailed bat, and Rota blue damselfly, due to small numbers of 
populations and individuals; to <em>Cycas micronesica, Heritiera longipetiolata, Psychotria malaspinae,</em>
            <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis,</em> the humped tree snail, 
Mariana eight-spot butterfly, and Slevin's skink from ordnance and 
live-fire training; to the Rota blue damselfly from water extraction; 
and to <em>Hedyotis megalantha</em> and <em>Phyllanthus saffordii</em> 
from recreational vehicles (Factor E) (see Table 3). These threats are 
exacerbated by these species' inherent vulnerability to extinction from 
stochastic events at any time because of their endemism, small numbers 
of individuals and populations, and restricted habitats.</p>

          <p id="p-554" data-page="59491">The Act defines an endangered 
species as any species that is “in danger of extinction throughout all 
or a significant portion of its range” and a threatened species as any 
species “that is likely to become endangered throughout all or a 
significant portion of its range within the foreseeable future.” We find
 that 16 of the 23 Mariana Islands species are presently in danger of 
extinction throughout their entire range, based on the severity and 
scope of the ongoing and projected threats described above. These 16 
species are: the 7 plants <em>Eugenia bryanii, Hedyotis megalantha,</em>
            <em>Heritiera longipetiolata, Phyllanthus saffordii,</em>
            <em>Psychotria malaspinae, Solanum guamense,</em> and <em>Tinospora homosepala;</em> and all 9 animals: the Pacific sheath-tailed bat (<em>Emballonura semicaudata rotensis</em>), Slevin's skink (<em>Emoia slevini</em>), the Mariana eight-spot butterfly (<em>Hypolimnas octocula marianensis</em>), the Mariana wandering butterfly (<em>Vagrans egistina),</em> the Rota blue damselfly (<em>Ischnura luta</em>), the Guam tree snail (<em>Partula radiolata</em>), the humped tree snail (<em>Partula gibba</em>), Langford's tree snail (<em>Partula langfordi</em>), and the fragile tree snail (<em>Samoana fragilis</em>).
 We conclude these 16 species are endangered due to the small number of 
individuals representing the entire species and the limited or 
concentrated geographic distribution of those remaining individuals or 
populations, rendering the species in its entirety highly susceptible to
 extinction as a consequence of these imminent threats. These threats 
are exacerbated by the loss of redundancy and resiliency of these 
species, and the continued inadequacy of existing protective 
regulations. Therefore, on the basis of the best available scientific 
and commercial information, we have determined that each of these 16 
species meets the definition of an endangered species under the Act. We 
find that threatened species status is not appropriate for these 16 
species, as the threats are already occurring rangewide and are not 
localized, because the threats are ongoing and expected to continue into
 the future, and because the severity of the threats is so great that 
these species are currently in danger of extinction. In addition, the 
remaining populations of these species are so small that we cannot 
conclude they are likely capable of persisting into the foreseeable 
future in the face of the current threats. We, therefore, list these 16 
species as endangered species in accordance with section 3(6) of the 
Act.</p>

          <p id="p-555" data-page="59491">As noted above, the Act 
defines a threatened species as any species “that is likely to become

            <em>Bulbophyllum guamense</em> is primarily known from Guam 
and Rota, with the exception of a few herbarium records that report this
 species as historically occurring on the islands of Pagan and Saipan. 
The cumulative data (<em>i.e.,</em> herbaria records, scientific 
literature, survey reports, books, and interviews with local biologists;
 as well as direct observations from Service and other biologists) show 
that <em>Bulbophyllum guamense</em> historically occurred on clifflines 
encircling Guam, and on the slopes of Mt. Lamlam and Mt. Almagosa; as 
well as across the Rota Sabana and surrounding slopes. As recently as 
1992, this species was reported to occur in large mat-like formations on
 trees “all over the island” (Guam) (Raulerson and Rinehart 1992, p. 
90). While the number of <em>B. guamense</em> individuals on Guam are 
low, the number of individuals on the Rota Sabana is much higher, with a
 relatively healthy population structure consisting of juveniles and 
adults (Zarones <em>et al.</em> 2015c, in litt.). Almost all of the individuals of <em>B. guamense</em>
 on Rota occur within the boundaries of the Sabana Conservation Area, 
which also encompasses much of the designated critical habitat for the 
Rota white-eye (<em>Zosterops rotensis</em>) and Mariana crow (<em>Corvus kubaryi</em>) (listed as endangered).</p>
          <p id="p-557" data-page="59492">Although more than 50 percent of the range of <em>B. guamense</em>
 occurs on Guam, where this species has experienced a significant 
decline in number of individuals and populations due to threats 
predominantly associated with habitat destruction and modification (<em>i.e.,</em>
 urban development, military development and training, brown treesnake, 
nonnative plants, fire, typhoons, and climate change), this species 
appears to be relatively healthy on Rota. However, due to the presence 
of threats similar to those on Guam (<em>i.e.,</em> habitat destruction 
and modification from nonnative plants and animals (rats), fire, 
typhoons, and climate change; and herbivory by invertebrates such as 
slugs), populations of <em>B. guamense</em> on Rota remain highly 
vulnerable. We conclude that, given its relatively greater population 
size on Rota, with a healthy population structure, <em>B. guamense</em> 
is not currently in danger of extinction; thus endangered status is not 
appropriate. However, given that we are unaware of any conservation 
actions being implemented at this time to abate the threats to <em>B. guamense</em>
 on Rota, and the best available scientific and commercial information 
indicates that the cumulative effects of the threats are so great the 
species will become in danger of extinction in the foreseeable future, 
we conclude that <em>Bulbophyllum guamense</em> meets the definition of a threatened species under the Act.</p>
          <p id="p-558" data-page="59492">
            <em>Cycas micronesica</em> occurs on Guam, Rota, and 
tentatively Pagan in the CNMI, as well as on islands in the nations of 
Palau and Yap. More than 50 percent of the known individuals occur on 
Guam and Rota in the CNMI, and are currently impacted by the cycad 
aulacaspis scale to the extent that botanists estimate the species could
 be largely extirpated from these two islands within 4 years, by 2019. 
The status of the tentative individuals of this species on Pagan is 
unknown, although only a small population is believed to occur on that 
island. While the cycad aulacaspis scale has reached the larger islands 
of Palau, it has not yet reached the Rock Islands of Palau, or Yap, and 
these islands may afford some temporary protection for the remaining 
individuals while control methods and biocontrols for the cycad 
aulacaspis scale are undergoing research. Due to the rapid spread of the
 scale and associated high mortality, populations in Palau and Yap 
remain highly vulnerable. Given its relatively greater population size 
and distribution on multiple islands, some of which have not yet been 
affected by the cycad aulacaspis scale, we conclude that <em>Cycas micronesica</em>
 is not currently in danger of extinction, thus endangered status is not
 appropriate. However, given the observed rapid spread of the cycad 
aulacaspis scale, the likelihood that the scale will soon be transported
 to areas that are currently unaffected, and the high mortality rate 
experienced by <em>Cycas micronesica</em> upon exposure to the scale, we conclude that <em>Cycas micronesica</em>
 is likely to become in danger of extinction within the foreseeable 
future, and thus meets the definition of a threatened species under the 
Act.</p>

            <em>Dendrobium guamense</em> predominantly occurs on the 
islands of Guam and Rota, with a few scattered occurrences on Tinian and
 Aguiguan. Historically, it also occurred on Saipan and possibly 
Agrihan. During the 1980s, this species was common in trees on Guam and 
Rota (Raulerson and Rinehart 1992, p. 98; Consortium Pacific Herbarium 
(CPH) 2012a—<em>Online Herbarium Database,</em> 5 pp.; Costion and Lorence 2012, p. 66). Currently, the populations of <em>D. guamense</em>
 on Guam, which comprise more than 50 percent of its known range, have 
declined to low numbers due to threats predominantly associated with 
habitat destruction and modification (<em>i.e.,</em> development, 
military training, nonnative plants and animals (brown treesnake), fire,
 typhoons, and climate change) (Harrington <em>et al.</em> 2012, in litt.). This species is abundant with healthy population structure on the island of Rota (Zarones <em>et al.</em> 2015c, in litt.). However, due to the presence of threats similar to those that occur on Guam (<em>i.e.,</em>
 habitat destruction and modification from nonnative plants and animals 
(rats), fire, typhoons, and climate change; and predation by nonnative 
invertebrates such as slugs), <em>D. guamense</em> remains highly vulnerable on Rota. Additionally, two or more threats exist on all islands on which <em>D. guamense</em>
 is known to occur (historically or present) (see Table 4, above). 
Raulerson and Rinehart (1992, p. 87), two renowned botanists who have 
studied extensively in the Marianas, stated that, although these orchids
 (referring to native orchids in the Marianas) appear abundant, the 
habitats are limited and in reality these orchids are quite rare. They 
also stated that the islands are small and habitats are rapidly being 
destroyed by human activity; thus these orchids can be considered rare. 
We conclude that, given its relatively large population size and 
distribution on multiple islands, and the healthy population structure 
on Rota, <em>Dendrobium guamense</em> is not currently in danger of 
extinction; thus endangered status is not appropriate. However, given 
the myriad threats imposed upon this species throughout its range, and 
the fact that <em>D. guamense</em> has significantly declined throughout more than 50 percent of its entire range, we have determined that <em>D. guamense</em>
 is likely to become in danger of extinction within the foreseeable 
future, and thus meets the definition of a threatened species under the 
Act.</p>

            <em>Maesa walkeri</em> occurs on the islands of Guam and 
Rota. Once relatively abundant on both of these islands, this species 
has since been reduced to extremely low numbers on Guam, which 
represents more than 60 percent of its former known range. On Rota, 
there are at least 684 individuals of <em>Maesa walkeri</em> in the 
Sabana region displaying a healthy population structure including 
seedlings, juveniles, and flowering adults (Liske-Clark <em>et al.</em> 2015, in litt.). Local biologists estimate the actual number to be in the thousands (Liske-Clark <em>et al.</em>
 2015, in litt.), and we concur with this estimate. Despite the relative
 abundance and seemingly healthy population structure of <em>Maesa walkeri</em> on Rota, this species remains vulnerable on this island due to <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59493"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59493" data-page="59493" data-text="Start Printed Page 59493" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59493}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59493</span></span></span>habitat
 destruction and modification by nonnative plants and animals (rats and 
Philippine deer), fire, typhoons, and climate change. Given its relative
 abundance and health on Rota, we conclude that <em>Maesa walkeri</em> 
is not currently in danger of extinction, thus endangered status is not 
appropriate. However, given the substantial decline in number of 
individuals on Guam (only two individuals known to remain) due to 
habitat destruction and modification by urban development, military 
training and development, nonnative plants and animals (<em>i.e.,</em> 
brown treesnake, pigs, and water buffalo), fire, typhoons, and climate 
change; the fact that Guam accounts for more than 60 percent of the 
known range for <em>Maesa walkeri;</em> and the presence of similar threats on Rota, we have determined that <em>Maesa walkeri</em>
 is likely to become in danger of extinction within the foreseeable 
future, and thus meets the definition of a threatened species under the

            <em>Nervilia jacksoniae</em> is known from the islands of 
Guam and Rota, and is the only endemic terrestrial orchid in the Mariana
 Islands. This species was once abundant on Guam and Rota, and has since
 declined to low numbers on Guam, which represents more than 60 percent 
of its former known range. Populations on Guam face threats associated 
with habitat destruction and modification by development, military 
training, nonnative plants and animals (<em>i.e.,</em> pigs, deer, water
 buffalo, and brown treesnake), fire, typhoons, and climate change; as 
well as herbivory by nonnative invertebrates such as slugs. Although 
relatively healthy populations can still be found on Rota (Zarones <em>et al.</em> 2015d, in litt.), these individuals face threats similar to those that occur on Guam (<em>i.e.,</em>
 habitat destruction and modification from nonnative animals (deer and 
rats) and plants, fire, typhoons, and climate change), and thus remain 
vulnerable. Given the relatively large and healthy populations on Rota, 
we conclude that <em>Nervilia jacksoniae</em> is not currently in danger
 of extinction, thus endangered status is not appropriate. However, 
given the substantial loss of individuals on Guam, which consists of at 
least 60 percent of its known range, combined with the myriad threats 
imposed upon <em>Maesa walkeri</em> throughout its range, we have 
determined that this species is likely to become in danger of extinction
 within the foreseeable future, and thus meets the definition of a 
threatened species under the Act.</p>

            <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis</em> was, until recently, believed to be part of the wider ranging <em>T. pandacaqui,</em>
 until genetic studies showed it to be unique to Guam and Rota. There 
may be as many as 8,000 individuals on Guam with a healthy population 
structure, but there are only a few individuals on Rota. The threats of 
habitat destruction and modification by nonnative plants and animals, 
fire, typhoons, climate change, and inadequate regulatory mechanisms 
exist throughout its range. Additionally, habitat destruction and 
modification from urban and military development, and military training,
 further negatively impact this species on Guam. Given the relatively 
large and healthy population of <em>T. rotensis</em> on Guam, even in the face of current threats, we conclude that <em>T. rotensis</em>
 is not currently in danger of extinction; thus endangered status is not
 appropriate. However, because the species has been reduced to only a 
few individuals on Rota, and the remaining population on Guam is subject
 to a suite of ongoing threats as described above, we conclude that <em>Tabernaemontana rotensis</em>
 is likely to become in danger of extinction within the foreseeable 
future. Therefore, on the basis of the best available scientific and

            <em>Tuberolabium guamense</em> is predominantly known from 
the islands of Guam and Rota, with a few scattered historical 
occurrences on Tinian and Aguiguan. This species was once relatively 
abundant within specialized habitat on Guam and Rota, but has since 
declined substantially on Guam, which comprises more than 50 percent of 
its known former range. On Guam, the habitat upon which this species 
depends is experiencing destruction and modification by urban 
development, military development and training, nonnative plants and 
animals (brown treesnake), fire, typhoons, and climate change. <em>Tuberolabium guamense</em> is still relatively abundant on Rota, with a population structure consisting of juveniles and flowering adults (Zarones <em>et al.</em>
 2015c, in litt.). Observations made during recent surveys indicate that
 this is the only endemic epiphytic orchid in the Marianas that is 
solely found in native trees (Zarones <em>et al.</em> 2015c, in litt.). Although <em>T. guamense</em>
 appears relatively healthy on Rota, its habitat on this island is 
experiencing destruction and modification from nonnative animals (deer 
and rats) and plants, fire, typhoons, and climate change. <em>Tuberolabium guamense</em>
 is also at risk from herbivory by nonnative invertebrates such as 
slugs. Additionally, more than 20 years ago Raulerson and Rinehart 
(1992, p. 87) stated that, although these orchids may appear abundant on
 the limestone ridges of Guam and Rota, the habitats are limited and in 
reality these orchids are very rare. We conclude that, given its 
relative abundance and health on Rota, <em>T. guamense</em> is not 
currently in danger of extinction; thus endangered status is not 
appropriate. However, due to the substantial loss of individuals on 
Guam, which consists of at least 60 percent of its known range, combined

necessary to halt or reverse the species' <span class="printed-page printed-page-inline unprinted-element icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic document-markup" data-page="59494"></span><span class="printed-page-wrapper unprinted-element-wrapper" style="top: 6px;"><span class="unprinted-element-border"></span><span class="printed-page unprinted-element cj-fancy-tooltip document-markup" id="page-59494" data-page="59494" data-text="Start Printed Page 59494" data-tooltip-template="#print-page-tooltip-template" data-tooltip-data="{&quot;page&quot;: 59494}" original-title=""><span class="icon-fr2 icon-fr2-doc-generic"></span><span class="text">Start Printed Page 59494</span></span></span>decline
 by addressing the threats to its survival and recovery. The goal of 
this process is to restore listed species to a point where they are 
secure, self-sustaining, and functioning components of their ecosystems.</p>

          <p id="p-567" data-page="59494">Recovery planning includes the
 development of a recovery outline shortly after a species is listed and
 preparation of a draft and final recovery plan. The recovery outline 
guides the immediate implementation of urgent recovery actions and 
describes the process to be used to develop a recovery plan. Revisions 
of the plan may be done to address continuing or new threats to the 
species, as new substantive information becomes available. The recovery 
plan identifies site-specific management actions that set a trigger for 
review of the five factors that control whether a species remains 
endangered or may be downlisted or delisted, and methods for monitoring 
recovery progress. Recovery plans also establish a framework for 
agencies to coordinate their recovery efforts and provide estimates of 
the cost of implementing recovery tasks. Recovery teams (composed of 
species experts, Federal and State agencies, nongovernmental 
organizations, and stakeholders) are often established to develop 
recovery plans. When completed, the recovery outline, draft recovery 
plan, and the final recovery plan will be available on our Web site (<em><a date="10/01/2015" href="http://www.fws.gov/endangered">http://www.fws.gov/​endangered</a></em>), or from our Pacific Islands Fish and Wildlife Office (see <strong class="minor-caps">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</strong>).</p>

          <p id="p-568" data-page="59494">Implementation of recovery 
actions generally requires the participation of a broad range of 
partners, including other Federal agencies, States, territories, 
nongovernmental organizations, businesses, and private landowners. 
Examples of recovery actions include habitat restoration (<em>e.g.,</em>
 restoration of native vegetation), research, captive-propagation and 
reintroduction, and outreach and education. The recovery of many listed 
species cannot be accomplished solely on Federal lands because their 
range may occur primarily or solely on non-Federal lands. To achieve 
recovery of these species requires cooperative conservation efforts on 
all lands.</p>

          <p id="p-569" data-page="59494">Following the publication of 
this final listing rule, funding for recovery actions will be available 
from a variety of sources, including Federal budgets, State programs, 
and cost-share grants for non-Federal landowners, the academic 
community, and nongovernmental organizations. In addition, pursuant to 
section 6 of the Act, the State(s) of the U.S. Territory of Guam and the
 U.S. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands would be eligible for
 Federal funds to implement management actions that promote the 
protection or recovery of the 23 species. Information on our grant 
programs that are available to aid species recovery can be found at: <em><a date="10/01/2015" href="http://www.fws.gov/grants">http://www.fws.gov/​grants</a></em>.</p>

          <p id="p-570" data-page="59494">Please let us know if you are 
interested in participating in recovery efforts for this species. 
Additionally, we invite you to submit any new information on these 
species whenever it becomes available and any information you may have 
for recovery planning purposes (see <strong class="minor-caps">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</strong>).</p>
          <p id="p-571" data-page="59494">Section 7(a) of the Act 
requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any 
species that is listed as an endangered or threatened species and with 
respect to its critical habitat, if any is designated. Regulations 
implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are 
codified at <a class="cfr external" href="https://www.federalregister.gov/select-citation/2015/10/01/50-CFR-402">50 CFR part 402</a>.
 Section 7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to confer with the
 Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued 
existence of a listed species or result in destruction or adverse 
modification of designated critical habitat. If a species is listed 
subsequently, section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies to 
ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely
 to jeopardize the continued existence of the species or destroy or 
adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a 
listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency 
must enter into consultation with the Service.</p>

          <p id="p-572" data-page="59494">For the 23 plants and animals 
listed as endangered or threatened species in this rule, Federal agency 
actions that may require consultation as described in the preceding 
paragraph include, but are not limited to, actions within the 
jurisdiction of the Natural Resources Conservation Service, the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and 
branches of the Department of Defense (DOD). Examples of these types of 
actions include activities funded or authorized under the Farm Bill 
Program, Environmental Quality Incentives Program, Ground and Surface 
Water Conservation Program, Clean Water Act (<a class="usc external" href="https://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=33&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=1251&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html" target="_blank">33 U.S.C. 1251</a> <em>et seq.</em>),

training, facilities construction and maintenance, or other military 
missions.</p>
          <p id="p-573" data-page="59494">The Act and its implementing 
regulations set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions 
that apply to all endangered and threatened wildlife and plants. The 
prohibitions of section 9(a)(1) of the Act, and implemented at <a class="cfr external" href="https://www.federalregister.gov/select-citation/2015/10/01/50-CFR-17.21">50 CFR 17.21</a>
 for endangered wildlife, and at §§ 17.61 and 17.71 for endangered and 
threatened plants, respectively, apply. For listed wildlife species, 
these prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to 
the jurisdiction of the United States to take (includes harass, harm, 
pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect; or to 
attempt any of these), import, export, ship in interstate commerce in 
the course of commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale in 
interstate or foreign commerce any listed species.

 it is also illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship
 any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions 
apply to agents of the Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, 
other Federal land management agencies, and State conservation agencies.</p>
          <p id="p-574" data-page="59494">With respect to endangered plants, prohibitions outlined at section 9(a)(2) of the Act and <a class="cfr external" href="https://www.federalregister.gov/select-citation/2015/10/01/50-CFR-17.61">50 CFR 17.61</a>

United States to import or export, transport in interstate or foreign 
commerce in the course of a commercial activity, sell or offer for sale 
in interstate or foreign commerce, or to remove and reduce to possession
 any such plant species from areas under Federal jurisdiction. In 
addition, the Act prohibits malicious damage or destruction of any such 
species on any area under Federal jurisdiction, and the removal, 
cutting, digging up, or damaging or destroying of any such species on 
any other area in knowing violation of any State law or regulation, or 
in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law.

 on July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34272), to identify to the maximum extent 
practicable at the time a species is listed, those activities that would
 or would not constitute a violation of section 9 of the Act. The intent
 of this policy is to increase public awareness of the effect of a final
 listing on proposed and ongoing activities within the range of a listed
 species. The following activities could potentially result in a 
violation of section 9 of the Act; this list is not comprehensive:</p>
          <p id="p-578" data-page="59495">(1) Unauthorized collecting, 
handling, possessing, selling, delivering, carrying, or transporting of 
the 23 species, including import or export across State, Territory, or 
Commonwealth lines and international boundaries, except for properly 
documented antique specimens of these taxa at least 100 years old, as 
defined by section 10(h)(1) of the Act.</p>
          <p id="p-579" data-page="59495">(2) Introduction of nonnative 
species that compete with or prey upon the nine animal species, such as 
the introduction of competing, nonnative plants or animals to the 
Mariana Islands (U.S. Territory of Guam and U.S. Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands).</p>
          <p id="p-580" data-page="59495">(3) The unauthorized release of biological control agents that attack any life stage of the nine animal species.</p>
          <p id="p-581" data-page="59495">(4) Impacts to the nine animal
 species from destruction of habitat, disturbance from noise (related to
 military training), and other impacts from military presence.</p>

          <p id="p-582" data-page="59495">Questions regarding whether 
specific activities would constitute a violation of section 9 of the Act
 should be directed to the Pacific Islands Fish and Wildlife Office (see

          <p id="p-583" data-page="59495">The Federal listing of the 23 
species included in this final rule may invoke Commonwealth and 
Territory listing under CNMI and Guam Endangered Species laws (Title 85:
 § 85-30.1-101 and 5 GCA § 63205, respectively) and supplement the 
protection available under other local law. These protections would 
prohibit take of these species and encourage conservation by both 
government agencies. Further, the governments are able to enter into 
agreements with Federal agencies to administer and manage any area 
required for the conservation, management, enhancement, or protection of
 endangered and threatened species. Funds for these activities could be 
made available under section 6 of the Act (Cooperation with the States 
and Territories). Thus, the Federal protection afforded to these species
 by listing them as endangered or threatened species will be reinforced 
and supplemented by protection under Territorial and Commonwealth law.</p>
