Lawyer: Lack of federal deportations a security concern
Read Story Gaynor Dumat-ol Daleno gdumat-ol@guampdn.com
Guam Police Department Officer C.N. Grondin on June 22 collects a broken chair allegedly used to attack a Tumon precinct officer who responded to a disturbance at the Hemlani Apartments in Harmon. Gov. Calvo on July 11 called for the deportation of two migrants accused in the attack. The men have not been convicted. Calvo later commuted the sentences of two migrants convicted of unrelated crimes, in exchange for their promise not to return to Guam.

Live insects on coconut leaves shipped from Rota for the Festival of the Pacific Arts in Guam were intercepted, and were later confirmed to be invasive species, the University of Guam said on Thursday afternoon.

“Neither of these species had been previously recorded in Guam,” UOG said in a statement. “Prior to release to FestPac participants, the coconut leaves were fumigated to kill all of the insects.”

UOG entomologist Dr. Aubrey Moore examined the leaf sample and found two types of insects, a whitefly and mealybug, UOG said.

The leaf sample was sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Systematic Entomology Laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland, because Guam does not have the resources to determine the species of the pests.

The Guam Customs and Quarantine Agency intercepted the live insects on coconut leaves from Rota on May 21.

The agency forwarded a small leaf sample with insects attached to the Guam Plant Inspection Facility, which is operated by the Guam Department of Agriculture. UOG scientists conduct pest identification services for the Plant Inspection Facility.

UOG said a report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture on Thursday stated that Dr. Greg Evans, a leading insect taxonomist, identified the pests as Aleurotrachelus atratus, the palm-infesting whitefly, and Palmicultor palmarum, the palm mealybug.
