SUMMARY Agricultural field sites were surveyed on Guam to identify the host range of the silverleaf whitefly (Bemisia argentifolii Bellows & Perring). Thirteen plant species were identified as hosts of this pest. Among agricultural crops, B. argentifolii was found frequently on eggplant (Solanum melongena L.), tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.), cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.), and watermelon (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai), while Euphorbia hirta L., Physalis angulata L. and Stachytarphetajamaicensis (L.) Vahl were the host plants among farmland weeds. The developing time from egg to adult ranged between 16 to 20 days on tomato seedlings grown in a screenhouse. Two larval parasitoids were collected from silverleafwhitefly infesting eggplant and tomato foliage. They were identified as Encarsia nigricephala Dozier and Eretmocerus sp.

(Enkegaard, 1993; Wagner, 1995). On cotton, a developmental time from the egg to the adult stage varied between 16 to 20 days at the
temperature range of 23 oc to 32 °C (Wagner,
1995). The number of eggs oviposited on tobacco was the highest with 86.4 per adult female at 22° C while on poinsettia it was
highest (263.0 per adult female) at 28 oc
(Enkegaard, 1993). Several natural enemies have been
identified as prospective biological control agents ofthe silverleafwhitefly. Heinz and Parrella (1994a) evaluated one predator (Delphastus pusillus Leconte) and four parasitoids (Encarsia spp.) of the silverleaf whitefly infesting two cultivars ofpoinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima Wild.) in a laboratory. They suggested that a greater success of biocontrol may be achieved by releases ofD. pusillus ifthe pest population was high, and by releases of E. formosa (Gahan) or mated E. pergandiella (Howard) regardless the pest density. In another report, Heinz and Parrella (1994b) suggested weekly releases of E.luteola Howard with additional releases of D. pusillus to control B. argentifolii infesting greenhousegrown poinsettia. Recently, Headrick et al. (1995) described in detail, the behaviors of female Eretmocerus sp. nr. californicus Howard feeding B. argentifolii on sweet potato, Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.
On Guam, the tropical climate allows B. argentifolii to fmd its host plants throughout the year in continuous cropping or natural vegetation. The purpose of this study was to identify the host range, the life cycle, and

parasitoids of the B. argentifolii present on Guam.
MATERIALS AND METHODS Host plants: Several farms on Guam with crops infested by the new whitefly were surveyed to determine its host range between February to June, 1995 on Guam. The presence of adult whiteflies on crops and weeds in the fields was noted. Weeds in areas adjacent to crop growing fields were also examined. If eggs and nymph stages of the whiteflies were observed, whole plants or leaves of crops and weeds were sampled and examined under a dissecting microscope. The degree of host preference was determined by (1) the presence or absence of whitefly on a plant, (2) the developing stages of the insect found on plant and, (3) visual observation on the degree of infestation on foliage.
Life cycle of whitefly on tomato: Potted tomato seedlings (cv 'N-63') were exposed for 24 hrs from midday to midday to a field of cultivated eggplants which were heavily infested with silverleaf whiteflies. This pest infestation was started on March 20, 1995. Seedlings were then isolated in a insect screen cage where plants received ambient temperature (23-32 °C) and partial sunlight. Daily average relative humidity ranged from 63 to 87% during the experiment (NOAA Climatological Data, March and April, 1995). Five to ten leaflets with whiteflies were sampled daily and examined to reveal the rate of insect development at each observation date.

DISCUSSION
On Guam, B. argentifolii was found colonizing on six agricultural crops and eight farmland weeds in 16 families (Tables l and 2). The silverleafwhitefly has become a new insect pest of major vegetable crops including eggplant, watermelon, tomato, and cucumber. The plant host colonization varied due to a combination of crops grown at a site. However, eggplant appeared to be the most heavily infested crop by silverleafwhitefly on Guam. No differences were found in the colonization of the pest between two long purple eggplant cultivars, a hybrid (cv. Nitta x cv. Waimanalo) and cv. Takii Long Black, which were grown side_by ~ide in the same farm filed (Table 1). The wide host range ofB. argentifolii observed in this study was similar to that observed elsewhere (Hokama et al., 1993; Schuster et al., 1991).
The development time (16-20 days) from egg to adult on tomato foliage at the ambient temperature range of23 to 32 °C was

the same as the report on cotton by Wagner (1995). Disregarding other climatic factors, like tropical storms, we expect that silverleaf whitefly completes its life cycle within three weeks on Guam with the air temperature range of23-32 °C year around. Population density of the pest may be affected by the difference in precipitation between the dry months and the rainy months. During the 30 years from January 1965 to December 1994, March was the month with the least precipitation having the average rainfall of l 0.4 em. August, the wettest month, had the average rainfall of 38.1 em (NOAA Climatological Data, 1994).
This is the flrst report of Encarsia nigricepha/a on Guam. In 1993, on the island of Hawaii, E. nigricephala, E.formosa, E. pergandiela, E. transvena and Eretmocerus sp. were recovered from greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood), infesting tomatoes in greenhouses (K.ajita, 1994). It is not certain that Eretmocerus sp. isolated from Guam in the present study is identical to the species ofEretmocerus found in Hawaii. Since a lot of produce and 7

ornamentals are imported from Hawaii and California to Guam, the presence ofE. nigricephala may be due to its accidental entry with some host pests from these origins. There are no records of T. vaporariorum on Guam. It appears that E. nigricephala came to Guam with a different homopteran host species than T. vaporariorum.
The population of B. argentifolii can easily build up within a short period of time due to Guam's environmental condition. Frequent usage of pesticides against the pest may contribute to the creation of resistance problems. Efficacy of E. nigricephala and Eretmocerus sp. found on Guam as natural enemies should be evaluated in more detail. The introduction of additional effective biocontrol agents should be considered to prevent further damages to agricultural crops.
In recent years, the number of accidental introduction of insect pests to Guam has rapidly increased (Schreiner, 1991). Whiteflies which came to Guam with hibiscus plants from Hawaii in 1990, were described as B. tabaci then (Schreiner, 1991), but were probably B. argentifolii (Schreiner, personal communication). There is a great possibility of spreading B. argentifolii to other parts of Micronesia and to other areas of the Pacific region within a short time.
