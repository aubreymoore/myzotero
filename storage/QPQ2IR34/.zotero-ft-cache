2 The importance, diversity and conservation of insects

Curiosity alone as to the identities and lifestyles of the fellow inhabitants of our planet justifies the study of insects. Some of us have used insects as totems and symbols in spiritual life, and we portray them in art and music. If we consider economic factors, the effects of insects are enormous. Few human societies lack honey, which is provided by bees (or specialized ants). Insects pollinate our crops. Many insects share our houses, agriculture and food stores. Others live on us, on our domestic pets or our livestock, and more visit to feed on us, where they may transmit disease. Clearly, we should understand these pervasive animals.
Although there are millions of kinds of insects, we do not know exactly (or even approximately) how many. This ignorance as to how many organisms we share our planet with is remarkable considering that astronomers have listed, mapped and uniquely identified a comparable diversity of galactic objects. Some estimates, which we discuss in detail later, imply that the species richness of insects is so great that, to a near approximation, all organisms can be considered to be insects. Although dominant on land and in freshwater, few insects are found beyond the tidal limit of oceans.
In this opening chapter, we outline the significance of insects and discuss their diversity and classification, and their roles in our economic and wider lives. First, we outline the field of entomology and the role of entomologists, and then introduce the ecological functions of insects. Next, we explore insect diversity, and then discuss how we name and classify this immense diversity. Sections follow in which we consider some cultural and economic aspects of insects, their aesthetic and tourism appeal, their conservation, and how and why they may be reared. We conclude with a section on insects as food for humans and animals. In text boxes we discuss citizen involvement in entomology (Box 1.1), the phenomenal growth of butterfly houses (Box 1.2), the effects of tramp ants on biodiversity (Box. 1.3), the conservation of the large blue butterfly in England (Box 1.4) and insect threats to palm trees (Box 1.5).
1.1 WHAT IS ENTOMOLOGY?
Entomology is the study of insects. Entomologists are the people who study insects, and observe, collect, rear

and experiment with insects. Research undertaken by entomologists covers the total range of biological disciplines, including evolution, ecology, behaviour, anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and genetics. The unifying feature is that the study organisms are insects. Biologists work with insects for many reasons: ease of culturing in a laboratory, rapid population turnover, and availability of many individuals are important factors. The minimal ethical concerns regarding responsible experimental use of insects, as compared with vertebrates, are a significant consideration.
Modern entomological study commenced in the early 18th century when a combination of rediscovery of the classical literature, the spread of rationalism, and the availability of ground-glass optics made the study of insects acceptable for the thoughtful privately wealthy. Although today many people working with insects hold professional positions, some aspects remain suitable for informed citizens (Box 1.1). Charles Darwin’s initial enthusiasm in natural history was as a collector of beetles (as shown in the vignette for this chapter) and throughout his life he communicated with amateur entomologists throughout the world. Much of our present understanding of worldwide insect diversity is derived from studies of non-professionals. Many such contributions come from collectors of attractive insects such as butterflies and beetles, but others with patience and ingenuity continue the tradition of Jean-Henri Fabre in observing close-up the activities of insects. We can discover much of scientific interest at little expense regarding the natural history of even “well-known” insects. The variety of size, structure and colour in insects (see Plate 1a–f) is striking, whether depicted in drawings, photographs or movies.
A popular misperception is that professional entomologists emphasize killing or controlling insects, but numerous entomological studies document their beneficial roles.
1.2 THE IMPORTANCE OF INSECTS
There are many reasons why we should study insects. Their ecologies are incredibly variable. Insects may dominate food chains and food webs in terms of both

The importance of insects 3
Box 1.1 Citizen entomologists – community participation
The involvement of non-professional “citizen scientists” in biodiversity studies dates back at least to the 18th century, especially in the United Kingdom. Published guides to the fauna became best-sellers – Victorian ladies of leisure studied the flora and collected shells and fossils, wealthy gentlemen shot rare birds and collected their eggs, and the rich assembled “cabinets of curios” that became the world-renowned natural history collections of the great museums. Darwin, portrayed in the vignette at the beginning of this chapter, was a skilled collector and student of the Coleoptera, and many church curates, with little to do between Sunday sermons, were serious entomologists at a time when few were paid for such studies.
Despite the transformation of natural history into a professional science, areas such as floristics and ornithology continue to benefit from amateur involvement. The ever-increasing availability of internet-based guides to images, distribution maps, bird-songs, etc., encourages involvement of citizens in recording many facets of the biota of their local areas. The more popular insects are also subjects of interest to a wider public, and there is substantial participation in reporting occurrences, particularly for butterflies, dragonflies, wasps and bees, and beetles. Especially in Europe and North America, many can be identified (some more easily than others) without killing the insect, by eye or by using a hand lens. With digital photography, excellent macro-images can be passed to experts for confirmation of identification, used to “voucher” observations, and validated records then can be entered into databases. Citizen-collected records are valuable in establishing distributions and temporal presence (e.g. early and late dates for appearance) – and have assisted in documentation for conservation and for assessing effects of climate change.
The longest lasting, and surely largest, participatory survey, the Rothamsted Insect Survey, has used light-traps at over 430 sites in the United Kingdom, many operated by volunteers, since the 1960s. More than 730 species of macrolepidoptera have been recognized since the survey began, and more than 10 million data points (species identity × location × date × abundance) have been databased. Although this resource is used widely to infer effects of climate change, most studies infer that observed declines in lepidopteran populations relate more to the staggering loss of natural habitats to agriculture, with climate effects evident most in the previous years’ summer conditions.
In the United States, citizen scientists have been recruited to collect long-term data on sightings of migrating butterflies, eggs and larval populations of the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) and its milkweed habitat. Volunteers contribute to monarch conservation by regular monitoring of their local sites. One major goal is to understand how and why monarch populations vary in time and space, particularly during the breeding season in North America.

4 The importance, diversity and conservation of insects
The United Kingdom’s Ladybird Survey provides another example of public participation in insect recording. Ladybirds (called lady beetles or ladybugs in the United States; a pair of copulating adults is illustrated here) are common, colourful, and can be identified with appropriate guidance (using a “Ladybird Atlas”) built on several pre-existing specialist recording schemes. A website (http://www.ladybird-survey.org/) provides much information to help find and identify species, and provides online forms to record observations. There is great value in this scheme, as evidenced by the recent invasion of the United Kingdom by the East Asian harlequin ladybird (Harmonia axyridis); documentation of its spread and the impact on native ladybirds has been possible due to existing community surveys. Such a project requires a good existing database: the impacts of this introduced species in the United States can only be surmised as pre-invasion data are inadequate.
Global recording of odonates (dragonflies and damselflies) by amateurs is very popular, especially in Asia. As with small birds, identifications can be made at some distance using binoculars (as illustrated here). Photographic vouchers can be taken while the insects are sedentary (e.g. at dawn). Care must be taken though not to assume that the presence of adult odonates indicates water conditions suitable for nymphal development since adults are strong flyers (see section 10.5 on biomonitoring).
As with all observational data, appropriate checks on identifications are important and observer biases often occur. Thus citizen-science data should be interpreted with caution, although there is little doubt as to the value of data collection by an interested and informed public.

volume and numbers. Feeding specializations of different insect groups include ingestion of detritus, rotting materials, wood and fungus (Chapter 9), aquatic filter feeding and grazing (Chapter 10), herbivory (= phytophagy), including sap feeding (Chapter 11), and predation and parasitism (Chapter 13). Insects may live in water, on land, or in soil, during part or all of their lives. Their lifestyles may be solitary, gregarious, subsocial or highly social (Chapter 12). They may be conspicuous, mimics of other objects, or concealed (Chapter 14), and may be active by day or by night. Insect life cycles (Chapter 6) allow survival

under a wide range of conditions, such as extremes of heat and cold, wet and dry, and unpredictable climates.
Insects are essential to the following ecosystem functions: • nutrient recycling, via leaf-litter and wood degradation, dispersal of fungi, disposal of carrion and dung, and soil turnover; • plant propagation, including pollination and seed dispersal; • maintenance of plant community composition and structure, via phytophagy, including seed feeding;

The importance of insects 5

• food for insectivorous vertebrates, such as many birds, mammals, reptiles and fish; • maintenance of animal community structure, through transmission of diseases of large animals, and predation and paratization of smaller ones.
Each insect species is part of a greater assemblage and its loss affects the complexities and abundance of other organisms. Some insects are considered “keystone species” because loss of their critical ecological functions could lead to collapse of the wider ecosystem. For example, termites convert cellulose in tropical soils (section 9.1), suggesting that they are keystones in tropical soil structuring. In aquatic ecosystems, a comparable service is provided by the guild of mostly larval insects that breaks down and releases the nutrients from wood and leaves derived from the surrounding terrestrial environment.
Insects are associated intimately with our survival, in that certain insects damage our health and that of our domestic animals (Chapter 15) and others adversely affect our agriculture and horticulture (Chapter 16). Certain insects greatly benefit human society, either by providing us with food directly or by contributing to our food or materials that we use. For example, honey bees not only provide us with honey but also are valuable agricultural pollinators worth an additional estimated US$15 billion annually in increased crop yields in the United States alone. Also the quality of bee-pollinated fruits can exceed that of fruits pollinated by wind or selfing (see section 11.3.1). Furthermore, estimates of the value of pollination by wild, free-living bees is US$1.0–2.4 billion per year for California alone. The total economic value of pollination services estimated for the 100 crops used directly for human food globally exceeds US$200 billion annually. Furthermore, valuable services, such as those provided by predatory beetles and bugs or parasitic wasps that control pests, often go unrecognized, especially by city-dwellers, and yet such ecosystem services are worth billions of US$ annually.
Insects contain a vast array of chemical compounds, some of which can be collected, extracted or synthesized for our use. Chitin, a component of insect cuticle, and its derivatives act as anticoagulants, enhance wound and burn healing, reduce serum cholesterol, serve as non-allergenic drug carriers, provide strong biodegradable plastics, and enhance removal of pollutants from waste water, to mention just a few

developing applications. Silks from the cocoons of silkworm moths, Bombyx mori, and related species have been used for fabric for centuries, and two endemic South African species may be increasing in local value. The red dye cochineal is obtained commercially from scale insects of Dactylopius coccus cultured on Opuntia cacti. Another scale insect, the lac insect Kerria lacca, is a source of a commercial varnish called shellac. Given this range of insect-produced chemicals, and accepting our ignorance of most insects, there is a high likelihood that novel chemicals await our discovery and use.
Insects provide more than economic or environmental benefits; characteristics of certain insects make them useful models for understanding general biological processes. For instance, the short generation time, high fecundity, and ease of laboratory rearing and manipulation of the vinegar or common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, have made it a model research organism. Studies of D. melanogaster have provided the foundations for our understanding of genetics and cytology, and these flies continue to provide the experimental materials for advances in molecular biology, embryology and development. Outside the laboratories of geneticists, studies of social insects, notably hymenopterans such as ants and bees, have allowed us to understand the evolution and maintenance of social behaviours such as altruism (section 12.4.1). The field of sociobiology owes its existence to entomologists’ studies of social insects. Several theoretical ideas in ecology have derived from the study of insects. For example, our ability to manipulate the food supply (cereal grains) and number of individuals of flour beetles (Tribolium spp.) in culture, combined with their short life history (compared to most vertebrates), has provided insights into how populations are regulated. Some concepts in ecology, for example the ecosystem and niche, came from scientists studying freshwater systems where insects dominate. Alfred Wallace (depicted in the vignette of Chapter 18), the independent and contemporaneous discoverer with Charles Darwin of the theory of evolution by natural selection, based his ideas on observations of tropical insects. Hypotheses concerning the many forms of mimicry and sexual selection derive from observations of insect behaviour, which continue to be investigated by entomologists.
Finally, the sheer numbers of insects means that their impact upon the environment, and hence our lives,

6 The importance, diversity and conservation of insects

is highly significant. Insects are the major component of macroscopic biodiversity and, for this reason alone, we should try to understand them better.
1.3 INSECT BIODIVERSITY
1.3.1 The described taxonomic richness of insects
Probably slightly over one million species of insects have been described, that is, have been recorded in a taxonomic publication as “new” (to science that is), accompanied by a description and often with illustrations or some other means of recognizing the particular insect species (section 1.4). Since some insect species have been described as new more than once, due to failure to recognize variation or through ignorance of previous studies, the actual number of described species is uncertain.
The described species of insects are distributed unevenly amongst the higher taxonomic groupings called orders (section 1.4). Five “major” orders stand out for their high species richness: the beetles (Coleoptera); flies (Diptera); wasps, ants and bees (Hymenoptera); butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera); and the true bugs (Hemiptera). J.B.S. Haldane’s jest – that “God” (evolution) shows an inordinate “fondness” for beetles – appears to be confirmed since they comprise almost 40% of described insects (more than 350,000 species). The Hymenoptera have more than 150,000 described species, with the Diptera and Lepidoptera having at least 150,000 described species each, and Hemiptera over 100,000. Of the remaining orders of living insects, none exceed the approximately 24,000 described species of the Orthoptera (grasshoppers, locusts, crickets and katydids). Most of the “minor” orders comprise some hundreds to a few thousands of described species. Although an order may be described as “minor”, this does not mean that it is insignificant – the familiar earwig belongs to an order (Dermaptera) with fewer than 2000 described species, and the ubiquitous cockroaches belong to an order (Blattodea, which includes termites) with only about 7500 species. Moreover, there are only twice as many species described in Aves (birds) as in the “small” order Blattodea.

1.3.2 The estimated taxonomic richness of insects
Surprisingly, the figures given above, which represent the cumulative effort by many insect taxonomists from all parts of the world over some 250 years, appear to represent something less than the true species richness of the insects. Just how far short is the subject of continuing speculation. Given the very high numbers and the patchy distributions of many insects in time and space, it is impossible in our time-scales to inventory (count and document) all species even for a small area. Extrapolations are required to estimate total species richness, which range from some three million to as many as 80 million species. These various calculations either extrapolate ratios for richness in one taxonomic group (or area) to another unrelated group (or area), or use a hierarchical scaling ratio, extrapolated from a subgroup (or subordinate area) to a more inclusive group (or wider area).
Generally, ratios derived from temperate/tropical species numbers for well-known groups such as vertebrates provide rather conservatively low estimates if used to extrapolate from temperate insect taxa to essentially unknown tropical insect faunas. The most controversial estimation, based on hierarchical scaling and providing the highest estimated total species numbers, was an extrapolation from samples from a single tree species to global rainforest insect species richness. Sampling used insecticidal fog to assess the little-known fauna of the upper layers (the canopy) of Neotropical rainforest. Much of this estimated increase in species richness was derived from arboreal beetles (Coleoptera), but several other canopy-dwelling groups were found to be much more numerous than believed previously. Key factors in calculating tropical diversity included identification of the number of beetle species found, estimation of the proportion of novel (previously unseen) groups, estimation of the degree of host-specificity to the surveyed tree species, and the ratio of beetles to other arthropods. Certain assumptions have been tested and found to be suspect, notably, host-plant specificity of herbivorous insects, at least in some tropical forests, seems very much less than estimated early on in this debate.
Estimates of global insect diversity calculated from experts’ assessments of the proportion of undescribed

Insect biodiversity 7

versus described species amongst their study insects tend to be comparatively low. Belief in lower numbers of total species comes from our general inability to confirm the prediction, which is a logical consequence of the high species-richness estimates, that insect samples ought to contain very high proportions of previously unrecognized and/or undescribed (“novel”) taxa. Obviously, any expectation of an even spread of novel species is unrealistic, since some groups and regions of the world are poorly known compared to others. However, amongst the minor (less species-rich) orders there is little or no scope for dramatically increased, unrecognized species richness. Very high levels of novelty, if they do exist, realistically could only be amongst the Coleoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera and parasitic Hymenoptera. Molecular techniques, for example DNA barcoding, sometimes in conjunction with trained biodiversity technicians (parataxonomists), reveal high levels of cryptic (hidden) diversity of the latter two groups in Costa Rica (see Box 7.3).
Nevertheless, some (but not all) recent re-analyses tend towards the lower end of the range of estimates derived from taxonomists’ calculations and extrapolations from regional sampling rather than those derived from ecological scaling. A figure of between two and six million species of insects appears realistic.
1.3.3 The location of insect species richness
The regions in which additional undescribed insect species might occur (i.e. up to an order of magnitude greater number of novel species than described) cannot be in the northern hemisphere, where such hidden diversity in the well-studied faunas is unlikely. For example, the British Isles inventory of about 22,500 species of insect is likely to be within 5% of being complete, and the 30,000 or so described from Canada must represent over half of the total species. Any hidden diversity is not in the Arctic, with some 3000 species present in the American Arctic, nor in Antarctica, the southern polar mass, which supports a bare handful of insects. Evidently, just as species-richness patterns are uneven across groups, so too is their geographic distribution.

Despite the lack of necessary local species inventories to prove it, tropical species richness appears to be much higher than that of temperate areas. For example, a single tree surveyed in Peru produced 26 genera and 43 species of ants: a tally that equals the total ant diversity from all habitats in Britain. Our inability to be certain about finer details of geographical patterns stems in part from entomologists interested in biodiversity issues being based mostly in the temperate northern hemisphere, whereas the centres of richness of the insects themselves are in the tropics and southern hemisphere.
Studies in tropical American rainforests suggest that much undescribed novelty in insects does come from the beetles, which provided the basis for the original high species-richness estimate. Although beetle dominance may be true in places such as the Neotropics, this might be an artefact of research biases of entomologists. In some well-studied temperate regions such as the United Kingdom and Canada, species of true flies (Diptera) appear to outnumber beetles. Studies of canopy insects on the tropical island of Borneo have shown that both Hymenoptera and Diptera can be more species rich at particular sites than the Coleoptera. Comprehensive regional inventories or credible estimates of insect faunal diversity may eventually tell us which order of insects is globally most diverse.
Whether we estimate 30–80 million species or an order of magnitude less, insects constitute at least half of global species diversity (Fig. 1.1). If we consider only life on land, insects comprise an even greater proportion of extant species, since the radiation of insects is a predominantly terrestrial phenomenon. The relative contribution of insects to global diversity will be somewhat lessened if marine diversity, to which insects make a negligible contribution, actually is higher than currently understood.
1.3.4 Some reasons for insect species richness
Whatever the global estimate is, insects surely are remarkably speciose. This high species richness has been attributed to several factors. The small size of insects, a limitation imposed by their method of gas

exchange via tracheae, is an important determinant. Many more niches exist in any given environment for small organisms than for large organisms. Thus, a single acacia tree, that feeds one giraffe, supports the complete life cycle of dozens of insect species: a lycaenid butterfly larva chews the leaves; a bug sucks

the stem sap; a longicorn beetle bores into the wood; a midge galls the flower buds; a bruchid beetle destroys the seeds; a mealybug sucks the root sap; and several wasp species parasitize each host-specific phytophage. An adjacent acacia of a different species feeds the same giraffe but may have a very different suite of

Insect biodiversity 9

phytophagous insects. The environment is more fine-grained from an insect’s perspective compared to that of a mammal or bird.
Small size alone is insufficient to allow exploitation of this environmental heterogeneity, since organisms must be capable of recognizing and responding to environmental differences. Insects have highly organized sensory and neuromotor systems, which are more comparable to those of vertebrate animals than to those of other invertebrates. However, insects differ from vertebrates both in size and in how they respond to environmental change. Generally, vertebrate animals are longer lived than insects and individuals can adapt to change by some degree of learning. Insects, on the other hand, normally respond to, or cope with, altered conditions (e.g. the application of insecticides to their host plant) by genetic change between generations (e.g. leading to insecticide resistant insects). High genetic heterogeneity or elasticity within insect species allows persistence in the face of environmental change. Persistence exposes species to processes that promote speciation, predominantly involving phases of range expansion and/or subsequent fragmentation. Stochastic processes (genetic drift) and/or selection pressures provide the genetic alterations that may become fixed in spatially or temporally isolated populations.
Insects possess characteristics that expose them to other potentially diversifying influences that enhance their species richness. Interactions between certain groups of insects and other organisms, such as plants in the case of herbivorous insects, or hosts for parasitic insects, may promote the genetic diversification of eater and eaten (section 8.6). These interactions are often called coevolutionary and are discussed in more detail in Chapters 11 and 13. The reciprocal nature of such interactions may speed up evolutionary change in one or both partners or sets of partners, perhaps even leading to major radiations in certain groups. Such a scenario involves increasing specialization of insects, at least on plant hosts. Evidence from phylogenetic studies suggests that this has happened – but also that generalists may arise from within a specialist radiation, perhaps after some plant chemical barrier has been overcome. Waves of specialization followed by breakthrough and radiation must have been a major factor in promoting the high species richness of phytophagous insects.

Another explanation for the high species numbers of insects is the role of sexual selection in the diversification of many insects. The propensity of insects to become isolated in small populations (because of the fine scale of their activities) in combination with sexual selection (sections 5.3 and 8.6) may lead to rapid alteration in intra-specific communication. When (or if) the isolated population rejoins the larger parental population, altered sexual signalling deters hybridization and the identity of each population (incipient species) is maintained despite the sympatry. This mechanism is seen to be much more rapid than genetic drift or other forms of selection, and need involve little if any differentiation in terms of ecology or non-sexual morphology and behaviour.
Comparisons among insect groups and between insects and their close relatives may suggest some reasons for insect diversity. Which characteristics are shared by the most speciose insect orders: the Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera? Which features of insects do other arthropods, such as arachnids (spiders, mites, scorpions and their allies) lack? No simple explanation emerges from such comparisons; probably design features, flexible life-cycle patterns and feeding habits play a part (some factors are explored in Chapter 8). In contrast to the most speciose insect groups, arachnids lack winged flight, lack complete transformation of body form during development (metamorphosis) and lack dependence on specific food organisms, and generally do not feed on plants. Exceptionally, mites, the most diverse and abundant of arachnids, have many very specific associations with other living organisms, including with plants.
High persistence of species or lineages, or the numerical abundance of individual species are considered as indicators of insect success. However, insects differ from vertebrates by at least one popular measure of success: body size. Miniaturization is the insect success story: most insects have body lengths of 1–10 mm, with a body length of around 0.3 mm in mymarid wasps (which are parasitic on eggs of insects) being unexceptional. At the other extreme, the greatest wingspan in a living insect belongs to the tropical American owlet moth, Thysania agrippina (Noctuidae), with a span of up to 30 cm, although fossils show that some extinct insects were appreciably larger than their living relatives. For example, an Upper Carboniferous

Trim size: 189mm x 246mm

10 The importance, diversity and conservation of insects

silverfish, Ramsdelepidion schusteri (Zygentoma), had a body length of 6 cm, as compared to a modern maximum of less than 2 cm. The wingspans of many Carboniferous insects exceeded 45 cm, and a Permian dragonfly, Meganeuropsis americana (Meganisoptera), had a wingspan of 71 cm. Notably, amongst these large insects, the great size is predominantly associated with a narrow, elongate body, although one of the heaviest extant insects, the Hercules beetle, Dynastes hercules (Scarabaeidae), with a body up 17 cm long, is an exception in having a bulky body. The heaviest recorded insect is a weta (Anostostomatidae; see Plate 1d), with a female of the bulky Little Barrier Island giant weta, Deinacrida heteracantha, weighing 71 g.
Barriers to large size include the inability of the tracheal system to diffuse gases across extended distances from active muscles to and from the external environment (see Box 3.2). Further elaborations of the tracheal system would jeopardize water balance in a large insect. Most large insects are narrow and have not greatly extended the maximum distance between the external oxygen source and the muscular site of gaseous exchange, compared with smaller insects. A possible explanation for the gigantism of some Palaeozoic insects is considered in Box 8.2.
In summary, many insect radiations probably depended upon: (i) the small size of individuals, combined with (ii) short generation time, (iii) sensory and neuromotor sophistication, (iv) evolutionary interactions with plants and other organisms, (v) metamorphosis, and (vi) mobile winged adults. The substantial time since the origin of each major insect group has allowed many opportunities for lineage diversification (Chapter 8). Present-day species diversity results from either higher rates of speciation (for which there is limited evidence) and/or lower rates of species extinction (higher persistence) than other organisms. The high species richness seen in some (but not all) groups in the tropics may result from the combination of higher rates of species formation with high species accumulation in equable climates.
1.4 NAMING AND CLASSIFICATION OF INSECTS
The formal naming of insects follows the rules of nomenclature developed for all animals (plants have a slightly different system). Formal scientific names are

required for unambiguous communication between all scientists, no matter what their native language. Vernacular (common) names do not fulfil this need: the same insects may even have different vernacular names amongst people who speak the same language. For instance, the British refer to “ladybirds”, whereas the same coccinellid beetles are “ladybugs” to many people in the United States. Many insects have no vernacular name, or a common name is given to multiple species as if only one species is involved. These difficulties are addressed by the Linnaean system, which provides every described species with two given names (the binomen). The first is the generic (genus) name, used for a broader grouping than the second name, which is the specific (species) name. These Latinized names always are used together and are italicized, as in this book. The combination of genus and species names provides each organism with a unique name. Thus, the name Aedes aegypti is recognized by any medical entomologist, anywhere, whatever the local name (and there are many) for this disease-transmitting mosquito. Ideally, all taxa should have such a Latinized binomen, but in practice some alternatives may be used prior to naming formally (section 18.3.2).
In scientific publications, the species name often is followed by the name of the original describer of the species and perhaps the year in which the name first was published legally. In this book, we do not follow this practice but, in discussion of particular insects, we give the order and family names to which the species belongs. In publications, after the first citation of the combination of genus and species names in the text, it is common practice in subsequent citations to abbreviate the genus to the initial letter only (e.g. A. aegypti). However, where this might be ambiguous, such as for the two mosquito genera Aedes and Anopheles, the initial two letters Ae. and An. are used, as in Chapter 15.
Various taxonomically defined groups, also called taxa (singular: taxon), are recognized amongst the insects. As for all other organisms, the basic biological taxon, lying above the individual and population, is the species, which is both the fundamental nomenclatural unit in taxonomy and, arguably, a unit of evolution. Multi-species studies allow recognition of genera, which are discrete higher groups. In a similar manner, genera can be grouped into tribes, tribes into subfamilies, and subfamilies into families. The families of insects are placed in relatively large but easily recognized groups called orders. This hierarchy of ranks (or categories) thus extends from the species

level through a series of “higher” levels of greater and greater inclusivity until all true insects are included in one class, the Insecta. There are standard suffixes for certain ranks in the taxonomic hierarchy, so that the rank of most group names can be recognized by inspection of the ending (Table 1.1).
Depending on the classification system used, some 25 to 30 orders of Insecta may be recognized. Differences arise principally because there are no fixed rules for deciding the taxonomic ranks referred to above – only general agreement that groups should be monophyletic, comprising all the descendants of a common ancestor (section 7.1.1). Over time, a relatively stable classification system has developed, but differences of opinion remain as to the boundaries around and among groups, with “splitters” recognizing a greater number of groups and “lumpers” favouring broader categories. For example, some North American taxonomists group (“lump”) the alderflies, dobsonflies, snakeflies and lacewings into one order, the Neuroptera, whereas others, including ourselves, “split” the group and recognize three separate (but clearly closely related) orders, Megaloptera, Raphidioptera, and a more narrowly defined Neuroptera (see Fig. 7.2). The order Hemiptera has sometimes been divided into two orders, Homoptera and Heteroptera, but the homopteran grouping is invalid (non-monophyletic) and we advocate a different classification for these bugs as shown in Fig. 7.6 and discussed in section 7.4.2 and Taxobox 20. New data and methods of analysis are

further causes of instability in the recognition of insect orders. As we show in Chapter 7, two groups (termites and parasitic lice) previously treated as orders, belong within each of two other orders and thus the ordinal count is reduced by two.
We recognize 28 orders of insects, with relationships considered in section 7.4 and the physical characteristics and biologies of their constituent taxa described in taxoboxes near the end of the book. A summary of the diagnostic features of all orders and a few subgroups, plus cross references to fuller identificatory and ecological information, appear in tabular form in the reference guide to orders in the Appendix at the end of the book.
1.5 INSECTS IN POPULAR CULTURE AND COMMERCE
People have been attracted to the beauty or mystique of certain insects throughout history. We know the importance of scarab beetles to the Egyptians as religious items, and earlier shamanistic cultures elsewhere in the Old World made ornaments that represent scarabs and other beetles including buprestids (jewel beetles). In Old Egypt the scarab, which shapes dung into balls, is identified as a potter; similar insect symbolism extends also further east. Egyptians, and subsequently the Greeks, made ornamental scarabs from many materials including lapis lazuli, basalt, limestone, turquoise, ivory, resins, and even valuable gold and silver. Such adulation may have been the pinnacle that an insect lacking economic importance ever gained in popular and religious culture, although many human societies recognized insects in their ceremonial lives. The ancient Chinese regarded cicadas as symbolizing rebirth or immortality. In Mesopotamian literature the Poem of Gilgamesh alludes to odonates (dragonflies/damselflies) as signifying the impossibility of immortality. In martial arts the swaying and sudden lunges of a praying mantis are evoked in Chinese praying mantis kung fu. The praying mantis carries much cultural symbolism, including creation and patience in zen-like waiting for the San (“bushmen”) of the Kalahari. Honeypot ants (yarumpa) and witchety grubs (udnirringitta) figure amongst the personal or clan totems of Aboriginal Australians of the Arrernte language groups. Although important as food in the arid central Australian environment (see section 1.8.1), these insects were not to be eaten by clan members belonging to that particular totem.

12 The importance, diversity and conservation of insects

Totemic and food insects are represented in many Aboriginal artworks in which they are associated with cultural ceremonies and the depiction of important locations. Insects have had a place in many societies for their symbolism – such as ants and bees representing

hard workers throughout the Middle Ages of Europe, where they even entered heraldry. Crickets, grasshoppers, cicadas, and scarab and lucanid beetles have long been valued as caged pets in Japan. Ancient Mexicans observed butterflies in detail, and lepidopterans were

Box 1.2 Butterﬂy houses
It used to be that seeing tropical butterflies entailed an expensive visit to an exotic location in order to appreciate their living diversity of shape and colours. Now many children are not far from a tropical butterfly house displaying, for a quite modest entry fee, many examples of some of the showiest lepidopterans. These live insects fly free in spacious walk-in cages or greenhouses replete with tropical vegetation and the appropriate mood sounds of a remote rainforest.
In just 35 years, the number of butterfly houses worldwide has gone from none to several hundred, attracting an estimated 40 million annual visitors and with a global turnover valued at some US$100 million. Equally dramatic has been the conversion from networks of local suppliers to industrial-scale insect production facilities. Although an estimated 4000 species of butterflies have been reared in the tropics, for the past decade some 500 have been listed for sale, and worldwide a core of only 50 species constitute most of those traded, primarily as live pupae. Papilionidae, including the well-known swallowtails, graphiums and birdwings, and Nymphalidae, including Caligo, Danaus, Heliconius and the electric blue Morpho species (see Plate 1f), are most popular.
Early on, when butterfly houses emphasized education and conservation, the exhibited butterflies were reared by local people, who sometimes were organized into co-operatives. Production came from tropical countries, including Costa Rica, Kenya and Papua New Guinea. “Ranching” butterflies for export in the pupal stage provides economic benefits and revenue flows to local communities and assists in natural habitat conservation. In East Africa, the National Museums of Kenya, in collaboration with many biodiversity programmes, supported local people of the Arabuko-Sukoke forest-edge in the Kipepeo Project to export harvested butterflies for live overseas exhibit. Self-sustaining since 1999, the project has enhanced income for impoverished people, and supported further nature-based projects including honey production. In Papua New Guinea, village farmers enhance (“ranch”) the appropriate vine hosts for butterflies, often on land cleared at the forest edge for their vegetable gardens. Wild adult butterflies emerge from the forest to feed and lay their eggs; hatched larvae feed on the managed vines until harvested at pupation. According to species and conservation legislation, butterflies can be exported live as pupae, or dead as high-quality collector specimens.
Ranching evidently is a “small volume with high unit cost” process, suited best to rare species, and providing dead specimens for collectors in high-value trade. However, the much expanded modern insect zoos and butterfly houses require mass production rearing techniques in order to satisfy the demand for a limited range of species of selected butterflies in high numbers and continuous availablity (see Plate 1g). In some tropical countries, such as Costa Rica and Malaysia, commercial facilities have been constructed to provide continuous breeding in confinement from a few founder individuals, providing high-quality pupae in volume for air-freighting to purchasers. Although this is now “large volume with small unit value” production, major farms are likely to be more sustainable ecologically, due to their ability to maintain continuous culture, than are small individual breeders. However, larger suppliers often maintain the link to local butterfly farmers or ranchers. It might be argued that ranching, by potentially depleting wild populations, carries a risk of damage to target species. However, in the Kenyan Kipepeo Project, although preferred lepidopteran species originated from the wild as eggs or early larvae, walk-through visual assessment of butterflies in flight suggested that the relative abundance rankings of species was unaffected despite many years of selective harvest for export. Furthermore, ranching there and in New Guinea builds local support for intact forest as a valuable resource, rather than as “wasted” land to clear for subsistence agriculture.
Of course, irrespective of production method, the translocation of non-native insects for the public to view carries inherent risks. Escape, breeding and establishment outside the native range is a potential problem – not every butterfly is “harmless” and several have larvae that feed on our crops. For example, the attractive Australian orchid swallowtail (Papilio aegeus) has larvae that defoliate most species of citrus (lemons, limes, oranges and grapefruit and significant natives), and must be constrained to Australian butterfly houses.

well represented in mythology, including in poem and song. Amber has a long history as jewellery, and the inclusion of insects can enhance the value of the piece.
Most urbanized humans have lost much of this contact with insects, excepting those that share our domicile, such as the cockroaches, tramp ants and hearth crickets that generally arouse antipathy. Nonetheless, exhibits of insects, notably in butterfly farms and insect zoos, are very popular, with millions of people per year visiting such attractions throughout the world (Box 1.2). Insects remain part of Japanese culture, and not only for children; there are insect video games, numerous suppliers of entomological equipment, thousands of personal insect collections, and beetle breeding and rearing is so popular that it can be called beetlemania. In other countries, natural occurrences of certain insects attract ecotourism, including aggregations of overwintering monarch butterflies in coastal central California and in Mexico, the famous glow-worm caves of Waitomo, New Zealand, and Costa Rican locations such as Selva Verde rich in tropical insect biodiversity.
Although insect ecotourism may be limited, other economic benefits are associated with an interest in insects. This is especially so amongst children in Japan, where native rhinoceros beetles (Scarabaeidae, Allomyrina dichotoma) sell for a few US$ each, and longer-lived common stag beetles for up to US$10, and may be purchased from automatic vending machines. Adults collect and rear insects with a passion: at the peak of a craze for the large Japanese stag beetle (Lucanidae, Dorcus curvidens, called o-kuwagata) one could sell for between 40,000 and 150,000 yen (US$300 and US$1250), depending on whether captive reared or taken from the wild. Largest specimens, even if captive reared, fetched several million yen >US $10,000 at the height of the fashion. Such enthusiasm by Japanese collectors can lead to a valuable market for insects from outside Japan. According to official statistics, in 2002 some 680,000 beetles, including over 300,000 each of rhinoceros and stag beetles, were imported, predominantly originating from southern and Southeast Asia. Enthusiasm for valuable specimens extends outside Coleoptera: Japanese and German tourists are reported in the past decade to have purchased rare butterflies in Vietnam for US$1000–2000, which is a huge income for the generally poor local people. Unfortunately, some collectors ignore other countries’ legislation (including that of Australia, New Zealand and Himalayan countries) by collecting without

permits/licences, taking large numbers of insects and damaging the environment in their desire to harvest them rapidly.
In Asia, particularly in Malaysia, there is interest in rearing, exhibiting and trading in mantises (Mantodea), including orchid mantises (Hymenopus species; see sections 13.1.1 and 14.1) and stick-insects (Phasmatodea). Hissing cockroaches from Madagascar and burrowing cockroaches from tropical Australia are reared readily in captivity and can be kept as domestic pets as well as being displayed in insect zoos in which handling the exhibits is encouraged.
Questions remain as to whether wild insect collection, either for personal interest or commercial trade and display, is sustainable. In Japan, although expertise in captive rearing has increased and thus undermined the very high prices paid for certain wild-caught beetles, wild harvesting continues over an ever-increasing region. The possibility of over-collection for trade is discussed in section 1.7, together with other conservation issues.
1.6 CULTURING INSECTS
Many species of insects are maintained routinely in culture for purposes ranging from commercial sale, to scientific research, and even to conservation and reintroduction into the wild. As mentioned in section 1.2, much of our understanding of genetics and developmental biology comes from Drosophila melanogaster – a species with a short generation time of about 10 days, high fecundity with hundreds of eggs in a lifetime, and ease of culture in simple yeast-based media. These characteristics allow for large-scale research studies across many generations in an appropriate timescale. Other species of Drosophila can be reared in a similar manner, although often requiring more particular dietary requirements, including micronutrients and sterols. Tribolium flour beetles (section 1.2) are reared solely on flour. However, many phytophagous insects can be reared only on a particular host plant, in a time- and space-consuming programme, and the search for artificial diets is an important component of applied entomological research. Thus, Manduca sexta, the tobacco hornworm, which has provided many physiological insights, including how metamorphosis is controlled, is reared en masse on artificial diets of wheatgerm, casein, agar, salts and vitamins, rather than on any of its diverse natural host plants.

14 The importance, diversity and conservation of insects

The situation is more complex if host-specific insect parasitoids of pests are to be reared for biological control purposes. In addition to maintaining the pest in quarantine to avoid accidental release, the appropriate life stage must be available for the mass production of parasitoids. The rearing of egg parasitoid Trichogramma wasps for biological control of caterpillar pests, which commenced over a century ago, relies on the availability of large numbers of moth eggs. Typically, these come from one of two species, the Angoumois grain moth, Sitotroga cerealella, and the Mediterranean flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella, which are reared easily and inexpensively on wheat or other grains. The use of artificial media, including insect haemolymph and artificial moth eggs, have been patented as being more efficient egg production methods. However, if host location by parasitoids involves chemical odours produced by damaged tissues (section 4.3.3), such signals are unlikely to be produced by an artificial diet. Thus, mass production of parasitoids against troublesome wood-mining beetle larvae must involve rearing the beetles from egg to adult on appropriately conditioned wood of the correct plant species.
Insects such as crickets, mealworms (tenebrionid beetle larvae) and bloodworms (midge larvae) are mass-reared commercially for feeding to pets, or as bait for anglers. Immature soldier flies can recycle domestic “green” waste and provide feed for chickens and certain pets (see Box 9.1). Furthermore, hobbyists and insect pet owners form an increasing clientele for captive-reared insects such as scarabs and lucanid beetles, mantises, phasmids and tropical cockroaches, many of which can be bred with ease by children following on-line instructions.
Zoos, particularly those with butterfly houses (Box 1.2) or petting facilities, maintain some of the larger and more charismatic insects in captivity. Indeed, some zoos have captive-breeding programmes for certain insects that are endangered in the wild – such as the endangered Lord Howe Island phasmid (Dryococelus australis; see Plate 1c), a large, flightless stick-insect captive-reared on the island and in Melbourne Zoo (in Australia). In New Zealand, several species of charismatic wetas (outsized, flightless orthopterans; see Plate 1d) have been reared in captivity and successfully reintroduced to predator-free offshore islands. Among the greatest successes have been the rearing of several endangered species of butterfly in captivity in Europe and North America, for example by the Oregon Zoo, with eventual releases

and reintroductions into restored habitat proving quite successful as interim conservation strategies.
1.7 INSECT CONSERVATION
The major threats to insect biodiversity are similar to those affecting other organisms, namely habitat loss and fragmentation, climate change, and invasive species. Introductions of alien social insects, especially ants (Box 1.3), invasive plants, generalist biological control agents (section 16.5), pathogens, and vertebrate grazers and predators often have led to threats to native insect species. Human-induced changes to climate affect the ranges and phenology of some insect species (section 17.3), but more research is needed on threats to non-pest insects other than butterflies. However, the prime cause of insect declines and extinctions, at least of local populations if not whole species, is the loss of their natural habitats.
Biological conservation typically involves either setting aside large tracts of land for “nature”, or addressing and remediating specific processes that threaten large and charismatic vertebrates, such as endangered mammals and birds, or plant species or communities. The concept of conserving habitat for insects, or species thereof, seems of low priority on a threatened planet. Nevertheless, land is reserved and plans exist specifically to conserve certain insects. Such conservation efforts often are associated with human aesthetics, and many (but not all) involve the “charismatic megafauna” of entomology – the butterflies and large, showy beetles. Such charismatic insects can act as “ﬂagship species” to enhance wider public awareness and engender financial support for conservation efforts. Flagship species are chosen for their vulnerability, distinctiveness or public appeal, and support for their conservation may help to protect all species that live in the flagship’s habitat. Thus, single-species conservation, not necessarily of an insect, is argued to preserve many other species by default, in what is known as the “umbrella effect”. Somewhat complementary to this is advocacy of a habitat-based approach, which argues for increases in the number and size of protected areas to conserve many insects, which are not (and arguably “do not need to be”) understood on a species-by-species basis. No doubt efforts to conserve habitats of native fish globally will preserve, as a spin-off, the much more diverse aquatic insect fauna that depends also upon waters being maintained in

Box 1.3 Tramp ants and biodiversity

No ants are native to Hawai’i, yet there are more than 40 species on the island – all have been brought from

elsewhere within the last hundred or so years. In fact, all social insects (honey bees, yellow jackets, paper wasps,

termites and ants) on Hawai’i have arrived as the result of human commerce.

Almost 150 species of ants have hitchhiked with us on our global travels and managed to establish themselves

outside their native ranges. The invaders of Hawai’i belong to the same suite of ants that have invaded the rest of

the world, or seem likely to do so in the near future. From a conservation perspective, one particular behavioural

subset of ants is very important, the so-called invasive “tramp” ants. They rank amongst the world’s most serious

pest species, and local, national and international agencies are concerned with their surveillance and control. The

big-headed ant (Pheidole megacephala), the long-legged or yellow crazy ant (Anoplolepis gracilipes), the Argentine

ant (Linepithema humile; see Plate 6e), the “electric” or little fire ant (Wasmannia auropunctata) and tropical fire

ants (Solenopsis species, especially S. geminata and S. invicta; see Plate 6e) are considered the most serious of

these ant pests.

Invasive ant behaviour threatens biodiversity, especially on islands such as Hawai’i, the Galapagos and other

Pacific Islands (section 8.7). Interactions with other insects include the protection and tending of aphids and scale

insects for their carbohydrate-rich honeydew secretions. This boosts densities of these insects, which include

invasive agricultural pests. Interactions with other arthropods are predominantly negative, resulting in aggressive

displacement and/or predation on other species, even other tramp ant species encountered. Initial founding is often

associated with unstable environments, including those created by human activity. The tendency for tramp ants to

be small and short-lived is compensated by year-round increase and rapid production of new queens. Nest-mate

queens show no hostility to each other. Colonies reproduce by one or more mated queens plus some workers

relocating only a short distance from the original nest – a process known as budding. When combined with the

absence of intraspecific antagonism between newly founded and natal nests, colony budding ensures the spread-

ing of a “supercolony” across the ground. Furthermore, some invasive ant species exhibit female parthenogenesis

(thelytoky) (section 5.10.1), which is beneficial in founding populations in new areas.

Although initial nest foundation is associated with human or naturally disturbed environments, most invasive

tramp species can move into more natural habitats and displace the native biota. Ground-dwelling insects, includ-

ing many native ants, do not survive the encroachment, and arboreal species may follow into local extinction.

Surviving insect communities tend to be skewed

towards subterranean species and those with especially thick cuticle such as carabid beetles and cockroaches, which also are chemically defended. Such an impact can be seen from the effects of big-headed ants during the monitoring of rehabilitated sand-mining

16 The importance, diversity and conservation of insects

Introduced ants are very difficult to eradicate: all attempts to eliminate the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, in the United States have failed, and now a few billion US$ are spent annually on control. This ant also has invaded the West Indies, China and Taiwan, and has spread rapidly. In contrast, it is hoped that an ongoing campaign, costing nearly A$200 million (more than US$150 million) in the first eight years, may prevent S. invicta from establishing as an “invasive” species in Australia. The first fire ant sites were found around Brisbane in February 2001, although this ant is suspected to have been present for a number of years prior to its detection. At the height of surveillance, the area infested by fire ants extended to some 80,000 ha. Potential economic damage in excess of A$100 billion over 30 years was estimated if control failed, with inestimable damage to native biodiversity continent-wide. Although intensive searching, baiting, and destruction of nests appear to have been successful in eliminating major infestations, all nests must be eradicated to prevent resurgence, and thus continual monitoring and containment measures are essential. Recent surveying has included the innovative use of an infrared and thermal camera mounted to a helicopter to capture image data during flight that later are analysed by a ground-based computer system “trained” to recognize a fire ant mound’s “signature” of reflected energy. Fortunately, incursions of S. invicta into New Zealand were detected rapidly and the populations eradicated. Undoubtedly, the best strategy for control of invasive ants is quarantine diligence to prevent their entry, and public awareness to detect accidental entry.

natural condition. Equally, preservation of old-growth forests to protect tree-hole nesting birds such as owls or parrots also will conserve habitat for wood-mining insects that use timber across a complete range of wood species and states of decomposition.
Land that once supported diverse insect communities has been transformed for human agriculture, urban development and to extract resources such as timber and minerals. Many remaining insect habitats have been degraded by the invasion of alien species, both plants and animals, including invasive insects (Box 1.3). The habitat approach to insect conservation aims to maintain healthy insect populations by supporting large patch (habitat) size, good patch quality, and reduced patch isolation. Six basic, interrelated principles serve as guidelines for the conservation management of insects: (i) maintain reserves; (ii) protect land outside of reserves; (iii) maintain quality heterogeneity of the landscape; (iv) reduce contrast between remnant patches of habitat and nearby disturbed patches; (v) simulate natural conditions, including disturbance; and (vi) connect patches of quality habitat. Habitat-based conservationists accept that single-species oriented conservation is important, but argue that it may be of limited value for insects because there are so many species. Furthermore, rarity of insect species may be due to populations being localized in just one or a few places, or in contrast, may be widely dispersed but with low density over a wide area. Clearly, different conservation strategies are required for each case.

Migratory species, such as the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), require special conservation. Although the monarch butterfly is not a threatened species, its migration in North America is considered an endangered biological phenomenon by the IUCN (the International Union for the Conservation of Nature). Monarchs from east of the Rockies overwinter in Mexico and then migrate northwards as far as Canada throughout the summer (section 6.7). Critical to the conservation of these monarchs is the safeguarding of the overwintering habitat at Sierra Chincua and elsewhere in Mexico. A highly significant insect conservation measure implemented in recent years is the decision of the Mexican government to support the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve (Mariposa Monarca Biosphere Reserve), which was established to protect this phenomenon. Another major threat to monarch butterflies is loss of larval breeding sites in North America (discussed in section 16.6.1). Efforts to monitor monarch populations in North America involve citizen scientists (Box 1.1). Successful conservation of this flagship butterfly requires collaborations involving the United States, Canada and Mexico, to ensure protection of both overwintering sites and migration flyway habitats. However, preservation of western overwintering populations in coastal California conserves no other native species. The reason for this is that the major resting sites are in groves of large, introduced eucalypt trees, especially blue gums, which have a depauperate fauna in their non-native habitat.

Insect conservation 17

A successful example of single-species conservation involves the endangered El Segundo blue butterfly, Euphilotes battoides ssp. allyni, whose principal colony in sand dunes near Los Angeles airport was threatened by urban sprawl and golf-course development. Protracted negotiations with many interested parties resulted in designation of 80 hectares as a reserve, sympathetic management of the golf course “rough” for the larval food plant Erigonum parvifolium (buckwheat), and control of alien plants plus limitation on human disturbance. Southern Californian coastal dune systems are seriously endangered habitats, and management of this reserve for the El Segundo blue conserves other threatened species.
Land conservation for butterflies is not an indulgence of affluent southern Californians: the world’s largest butterfly, the Queen Alexandra’s birdwing, Ornithoptera alexandrae, of Papua New Guinea, provides a success story from the developing world. This spectacular species, whose caterpillars feed only on Aristolochia dielsiana vines, is endangered and limited to a small area of lowland rainforest in northern Papua New Guinea. Under Papua New Guinean law, this birdwing species has been protected since 1966, and international commercial trade was banned by listing it on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The Queen Alexandra’s birdwing has acted as a flagship species for conservation in Papua New Guinea, and its initial conservation success attracted external funding for surveys and reserve establishment. Conserving Papua New Guinean forests for this and related birdwings undoubtedly results in conservation of much diversity under the umbrella effect, but mining and corrupt large-scale logging in Papua New Guinea in the past two decades threatens much of rainforests there.
As discussed in Box 1.2, Kenyan and New Guinean insect conservation efforts have some commercial incentives and provide impoverished people with some recompense for their protection of natural environments. However, commerce need not be the sole motivation: the aesthetic appeal of having native birdwing butterflies flying wild in local neighbourhoods, combined with local education programmes in schools and communities, are helping to save the subtropical Australian Richmond birdwing butterfly, Ornithoptera richmondia (see Plate 1e). Larval Richmond birdwings develop on two species of native Pararistolochia vines and require large plants to satisfy their appetite.

However, about two-thirds of the original coastal rainforest habitat supporting native vines has been lost, and the alien South American Aristolochia elegans (“Dutchman’s pipe”), introduced as an ornamental plant and escaped from gardens, lures females to lay eggs on it as a prospective host. This oviposition mistake is deadly since toxins of this plant kill young caterpillars. This conservation problem has been addressed by an education programme to encourage the removal of Dutchman’s pipe vines from native vegetation, from sale in nurseries, and from gardens and yards. Replacement in bush and gardens with native Pararistolochia was encouraged after a massive effort to propagate the vines. Birdwing populations isolated by habitat fragmentation also suffer inbreeding depression, which is being alleviated by planting corridors of suitable host plants and by captive breeding and reintroduction of genetically diverse individuals. Although recovery of the birdwing population was impacted by continued loss of habitat and years of drought, wetter conditions from 2010 improved foodplant quality and, combined with a renewed cultivation effort, led to the first population increases following a century of decline. However, habitat loss continues and ongoing community action throughout the native range of the Richmond birdwing is necessary to reverse its decline.
The idea that concerned citizens can conserve insects by management of their gardens (backyards) has gained acceptance, notably with regard to bee decline. Guidance is available, including from “show gardens”, for developing a pollinator-friendly garden by growing selected plants, emphasizing nectar-producers such as borage (which is best for honey bees), lavender (for bumblebees) and marjoram (an all-round attractant to all bees and hoverflies). With increasing enthusiasm for local/urban honey-bee hives, sustainability can be attained only by increasing flowering plants in gardens and public spaces to provide food sources for a diversity of insects.
Butterflies and bees, being familiar insects with nonthreatening lifestyles, are flagships for invertebrate conservation. However, certain orthopterans, including New Zealand wetas, have been afforded legal protection, and conservation plans exist for dragonflies and other freshwater insects in the context of conservation and management of aquatic environments, and there are plans for firefly (beetle) and glow worm (fungus gnat) habitats. Agencies in certain countries have recognized the importance of retention of fallen

dead wood as insect habitat, particularly for long-lived wood-feeding beetles.
Designation of reserves for conservation, seen by some as the answer to threat, rarely is successful without understanding species requirements and responses to management. The butterfly family Lycaenidae (blues, coppers and hairstreaks), with some 6000 species, comprises over 30% of the butterfly diversity. Many have relationships with ants (myrmecophily; see section 11.3.1), some being obliged to pass some or all of their immature development inside ant nests,

others are tended on their preferred host plant by ants, yet others are predators on ants and scale insects, while being tended by ants. These relationships can be very complex, and may be rather easily disrupted by environmental changes, leading to threats to the butterflies. Certainly in Western Europe, species of Lycaenidae figure prominently on lists of threatened insect taxa. Notoriously, the decline of the large blue butterfly Phengaris (formerly Maculinea) arion in England was blamed upon over-collection, but see Box 1.4 for a different interpretation. Action plans

Box 1.4 Conservation of the large blue butterﬂy
The large blue butterfly, Phengaris (formerly Maculinea) arion (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae), was reported to be in serious decline in southern England in the late 19th century, a phenomenon ascribed then to poor weather. By the mid-20th century, this attractive species was restricted to some 30 colonies in southwest England. Few colonies remained by 1974 and the estimated adult population had declined from about 100,000 in 1950 to 250 in some 20 years. Final extinction of the species in England in 1979 followed two successive hot, dry breeding seasons. Since the butterfly is beautiful and highly sought by collectors, excessive collecting was presumed to have caused at least the long-term decline that made the species vulnerable to deteriorating climate. This decline occurred even though a reserve was established in the 1930s to exclude both collectors and domestic livestock, in an attempt to protect the butterfly and its habitat.
Evidently, habitat had changed through time, including a reduction of wild thyme (Thymus praecox), which provides the food for early instars of the large blue’s caterpillar. Shrubbier vegetation replaced short-turf grassland because of loss of grazing rabbits (through disease) and the exclusion of grazing cattle and sheep from the reserved habitat. Thyme survived, however, but the butterflies continued to decline to extinction in Britain.
A more complex story has since been revealed by research associated with the reintroduction of the large blue to England from continental Europe. The larva of the large blue butterfly in England and on the European continent is an obligate predator in colonies of red ants belonging to species of Myrmica. Larval large blues must enter a Myrmica nest, in which they feed on larval ants. Similar predatory behaviour, and/or tricking ants into feeding them as if they were the ants’ own brood, are features in the natural history of many Lycaenidae (blues and coppers) worldwide (section 1.7 and section 12.3). After hatching from an egg laid on the larval food plant, the large blue’s caterpillar feeds on thyme flowers until the moult into the final (fourth) larval instar, around August. At dusk, the caterpillar drops to the ground from the natal plant, where it waits inert until a Myrmica ant finds it. The worker ant attends the larva for an extended period, perhaps more than an hour, during which it feeds from a sugar gift secreted from the caterpillar’s dorsal nectary organ. At some stage, the caterpillar becomes turgid and adopts a posture that seems to convince the tending ant that it is dealing with an escaped ant brood, and it is carried into the nest. Until this stage, immature growth has been modest, but in the ant nest the caterpillar becomes predatory on ant eggs and larvae and grows rapidly. The caterpillar spends winter in the ant nest and, 9–10 months after it entered the nest, pupates in early summer of the following year. The caterpillar requires an average 230 immature ants for successful pupation. It apparently escapes predation by the ants by secreting surface chemicals that mimic those of the ant brood, and probably receives special treatment in the colony by producing sounds that mimic those of the queen ant (section 12.3). The adult butterfly emerges from the pupal cuticle in summer, and departs rapidly from the nest before the ants identify it as an intruder.
Adoption and incorporation into the ant colony turns out to be the critical stage in the life history. The complex system involves the “correct” ant, Myrmica sabuleti, being present, and this in turn depends on the appropriate microclimate associated with short-turf grassland. Longer grass causes cooler near-soil microclimate conditions, favouring other Myrmica species, including M. scabrinodes, which may displace M. sabuleti. Although caterpillars

associate apparently indiscriminately with any Myrmica species, survivorship differs dramatically: with M. sabuleti approximately 15% survive, but an unsustainable reduction to <2% survivorship occurs with M. scabrinodes. Successful maintenance of large blue populations requires that >50% of the adoption by ants must be by M. sabuleti.
Other factors affecting survivorship include the requirements for the ant colony to have no alate (winged) queens and have at least 400 well-fed workers to provide enough larvae for the caterpillar’s feeding needs, and to lie within 2 m of the host thyme plant. Such nests are associated with newly burnt grasslands, which are rapidly colonized by M. sabuleti. Nests should not be so old as to have developed more than the founding queen: the problem here being that with numerous alate queens in the nest, the caterpillar can be mistaken for a queen and attacked and eaten by nurse ants.
Now that we understand the intricacies of the relationship, we can see that the well-meaning creation of reserves that lacked rabbits and excluded other grazers created vegetation and microhabitat changes that altered the dominance of ant species, to the detriment of the butterfly’s complex relationships. Over-collecting is not implicated, although on a broader scale climate change must be significant. Now, five populations originating from Sweden have been reintroduced to habitat and conditions appropriate for M. sabuleti, thus leading to thriving populations of the large blue butterfly. Interestingly, other rare species of insects in the same habitat have responded positively to this informed management, suggesting perhaps an umbrella role for the butterfly species.

in Europe for the reintroduction of this and related species, and appropriate conservation management of Phengaris species, have been put in place: these depend vitally upon a species-based approach. Only with understanding of general and specific ecological requirements of conservation targets can appropriate management of habitat be implemented.
The impediments to insect conservation are multifaceted and include poor public perception of the ecological importance of invertebrates, limited knowledge of their species diversity, distributions and abundance in space and time, and paucity of information on their sensitivity to changes in habitat. As discussed earlier, policymakers and land managers often assume that the protection of habitat for vertebrates will conserve resources for invertebrates under an umbrella effect. Clearly, we need more information on the effectiveness for insects and other invertebrates of conservation measures designed primarily for vertebrates and plants. Funding for comprehensive entomological surveys or experimental studies is always limited, but the identification and detailed study of suitable indicator or surrogate taxa can provide helpful guidelines for conservation decisions involving insects. Furthermore, valuable data on insect abundance, distributions and phenology can derive from citizen science programmes (Box 1.1).
1.8 INSECTS AS FOOD
1.8.1 Insects as human food: entomophagy
In this section we review the increasingly popular topic of insects as human food. Nearly 2000 species of insects in more than 100 families are, or have been, used for food somewhere in the world, especially in central and southern Africa, Asia, Australia and Latin America. Food insects generally feed on either living or dead plant matter, and chemically protected species are avoided. Termites, crickets, grasshoppers, locusts, beetles, ants, bee brood and moth larvae are frequently consumed insects. It is estimated that insects form part of the traditional diets of at least two billion people, but the ever-increasing human population and demand for food is causing over-exploitation of some wild edible insects. Although insects are high in protein, energy and various vitamins and minerals, and can form 5–10% of the annual animal protein consumed by

certain indigenous peoples, western society essentially overlooks entomological cuisine.
Typical “western” repugnance of entomophagy is cultural rather than scientific or rational. After all, other invertebrates such as certain crustaceans and molluscs are considered to be desirable culinary items. Objections to eating insects cannot be justified on the grounds of taste or food value. Many have a nutty flavour and studies report favourably on the nutritional content of insects, although their amino acid and fatty acid compositions vary considerably among different food-insect species.
Mature larvae of palm weevils, Rhynchophorus species (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), have been appreciated by people in tropical Africa, Asia and the Neotropics for centuries. These fat, legless “palmworms” (see Plate 2a) provide a rich source of animal fat, plus substantial amounts of riboflavin, thiamine, zinc and iron. Primitive cultivation systems involve wounding or felling palm trees to provide suitable food for the weevils. Such cultivation occurs in South America (Brazil, Colombia, Paraguay and Venezuela) and parts of Southeast Asia. Commercial facilities have been constructed in Thailand to raise the grubs on macerated (“chipped”) palm trunk and leaf-base tissues. However, throughout Asia, palmworms are pests that damage and kill coconut and oil palm trees in plantations. From this part of the world a Rhynchophorus species entered California, USA, threatening ornamental and date palms (Box 1.5).
In Africa, people eat many species of moth caterpillars that provide a rich source of iron and have high calorific value, with a protein content ranging from 45 to 80%. In Zambia, the edible caterpillars of emperor moths (Saturniidae), locally called mumpa, provide a valuable dietary supplement of fresh, fried, boiled or sun-dried larvae that offsets malnutrition caused by protein deficiency. Caterpillars of Gonimbrasia belina (Saturniidae) (see Plate 2b), called mopane, mopanie, mophane or phane, are utilized widely. They develop on the widespread mopane, a leguminous tree (Colophospermum mopane) that grows in a wide belt of open forest (“mopane woodland” landscape) across southern Africa (Fig. 1.2). Caterpillars are hand picked by poor rural women for family subsistence. The de-gutted insects are boiled or sometimes salted and dried, after which they contain about 50% protein and 15% fat – approximately twice the values for cooked beef. However, organized teams, largely of men,

Box 1.5 Palmageddon? Weevils in the palms
Residents of upmarket Laguna Beach in Orange County, southern California, are losing the ornamental palm trees that provide landscape features in this and other Mediterranean-climate communities (as illustrated here). In August 2010, a large dying Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis) was felled by arborists and found to be infested with weevils. The culprit was believed initially to be Rhynchophorus ferrugineus, the red palm weevil (see Plate 2a), that was causing problems already in Asia, the Middle East and Mediterranean Europe, but this was the first report of the pest in North America. Given that California’s date industry is valued at US$30 million, and ornamental palm tree sales at $70 million per year in California and $127 million in Florida, a research programme was commenced without delay.
The programme exemplifies many issues in insect biology associated with control of introduced pests. First, it was necessary to establish the size of the affected area. It is very unlikely that the first insects to be noticed are those that invaded: the public is rarely vigilant to early infestations, especially when symptoms may occur several years after arrival, and skilled specialists are ever-more thinly spread. Usually, arrival times of first invaders are estimated to have been several (too many) years prior to official recognition. Recruits had to be mobilized and trained to recognize the damage symptoms, and some form of automated trapping had to be developed and distributed in Laguna Beach and surrounds.
Since these weevils already were killing palms elsewhere in the world, researchers travelled to see how others coped with the problem, and also to observe the weevils in their native areas. The bad news was that the invasions in the Middle East and Mediterranean Europe were serious, spreading and uncontrolled. For example, since 2004 the south of France had been dealing with the weevils, which had spread along the Riviera to the Pyrenees and even to Corsica. Even the iconic palms that provide the backdrop to images of the Cannes Film Festival are dying. The good news was that an airborne lure that combined essence of damaged palms and weevil communication chemicals

(pheromones; section 4.3.2) had been developed already. This cocktail could be used to monitor the flying adult weevils in California, and potentially trap enough to exert some level of population control (section 16.9). California had some advantages, notably that the problems seemed restricted to Laguna Beach, and despite a crippling recession, a research budget was found quickly and implemented. Although total destruction by chipping the complete palm was the only method of control, residents were “on-side” with the programme.
In an unexpected twist, it turned out that the weevil that had entered the Golden State was not the globally invasive red palm weevil R. ferrugineus, but the differently pigmented (a black form with a red stripe) but otherwise similar, R. vulneratus. This revised identification, supported by molecular evidence for its distinction from red palm weevil, allows better identification of the natural source area, where its biology, including control can be studied (for more on biological control, see section 16.5), and explains some subtle differences in behaviour relative to the red palm weevil. The red stripe form of the weevil is native to Bali, Indonesia, where the larvae are considered to be such a “live” food delicacy that coconuts, sago and nipa (nypa) palms are damaged deliberately to induce weevil infestation, from which the tasty larvae are harvested. However, the occurrence of R. vulneratus in California does raise the question of how the weevils got there – this might have been explained more easily had the invader been the widespread and clearly invasive red palm weevil. It seems highly unlikely that a species otherwise restricted to Indonesia should arrive unaided on the opposite side of the Pacific Ocean and only in a solitary suburban location. Undoubtedly, a breach of biosecurity had occurred, yet it seems improbable that the “usual route” was responsible; that is, the legal (or otherwise) importation of infested host plants (large coconut or sago palms in this case). Scientists studying the situation suspect the demand for the weevil larvae as food led to illegal import of live weevils as a gastronomic souvenir. Perhaps the Californian dietary interest in locavory (eating local produce) could extend to include palm grubs? More seriously, can Californians imagine life without native palms dotting the landscape, and no palms in Palm Springs and no dates from the Coachella Valley?

now harvest intensively for commercial sale (mopane are available in certain urban supermarkets) and this increased demand has degraded a common property resource to an over-exploited and unsustainable “free-for-all” resource. Demand, especially from urban South Africa, has led to forest damage and localized moth extinction, including in Botswana. An optimistic sign of sustainability is a trial in Kruger National Park, where local people from Limpopo Province are supervised while they collect mopane worms within the park during a short, pre-Christmas season.
In the Philippines, June beetles (melolonthine scarabs), weaver ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) (see Plate 6b), mole crickets, palmworms (weevil larvae; Box 1.5, see also Plate 2a) and locusts are eaten in some regions. Locusts form an important dietary supplement during outbreaks, which apparently have become less common since the widespread use of insecticides. Various species of grasshoppers and locusts were eaten commonly by native tribes in western North America prior to the arrival of Europeans. The number and identity of species used have been poorly documented, but species of Melanoplus were among those consumed. Harvesting involved driving grasshoppers into a pit in the ground using fire or

advancing people, or herding them into a bed of coals. Today, people in Central America, especially Mexico, harvest, sell, cook and consume grasshoppers.
Australian Aborigines use (or once used) a wide range of insect foods, especially moth larvae. The caterpillars of wood or ghost moths (Cossidae and Hepialidae) (Fig. 1.3, see also Plate 2c) are called witchety grubs, from the Aboriginal word “witjuti” for the Acacia species (wattles), on the roots and stems of which the grubs feed. Witchety grubs, which are regarded as a delicacy, contain 7–9% protein, 14–38% fat and 7–16% sugars, as well as being good sources of iron and calcium. Adults of the bogong moth, Agrotis infusa (Noctuidae), formed another important Aboriginal food, once collected in their millions from aestivating sites in narrow caves and crevices on mountain summits in southeastern Australia. Moths cooked in hot ashes provided a rich source of dietary fat.
Aboriginal people living in central and northern Australia eat the contents of the apple-sized galls of Cystococcus pomiformis (Hemiptera: Eriococcidae), commonly called bush coconuts or bloodwood apples (see Plate 4f,g). These galls occur only on bloodwood eucalypts (Corymbia species) and can be very abundant after a favourable growing season. Each mature gall

contains a single adult female, up to 4 cm long, which is attached by her mouth area to the base of the inner gall and has her abdomen plugging a hole in the gall apex. The inner wall of the gall is lined with white edible flesh, about 1 cm thick, which serves as the feeding site for the male offspring of the female. Aborigines relish the watery female insect and her nuttyflavoured nymphs, then scrape out and consume the white coconut-like flesh of the inner gall.
A favourite source of sugar for Australian Aboriginals living in arid regions comes from species of Melophorus and Camponotus (Formicidae), popularly known as honeypot ants (Plate 2g–h). Specialized workers (called repletes) store nectar, fed to them by other workers, in their huge distended crops (see Fig. 2.4). Repletes serve as food reservoirs for the ant colony and regurgitate part of their crop contents when solicited by another ant. Aborigines dig repletes out from their underground nests, an activity most frequently undertaken by women, who may excavate pits to a depth of a metre or more in search of these sweet rewards. Individual nests rarely supply more than 100 g of a honey that is essentially similar in composition to commercial honey. Honeypot ants in the western United States and Mexico belong to a different genus, Myrmecocystus. The repletes, a highly valued food, are collected by the rural people of Mexico, a difficult

process in the hard soil of the stony ridges where the ants nest.
Perhaps the general western rejection of entomophagy is only an issue of marketing being required to counter a popular perception that insect food is for the poor and protein-deprived of the developing world. In reality, certain sub-Saharan Africans apparently prefer caterpillars to beef. Ant grubs (so called “ant eggs”) and eggs of water boatmen (Corixidae) and backswimmers (Notonectidae) are much sought after in Mexican gastronomy as “caviar”. In parts of Asia, a diverse range of insects can be purchased (see Plate 2d–f). Traditionally, desirable water beetles for human consumption are valuable enough to be farmed in Guangdong. The culinary culmination may be the meat of the giant water bug Lethocerus indicus or the Thai and Laotian mangda sauces made with the flavours extracted from the male abdominal glands, for which high prices are paid. Even in the urban United States some insects may become popular as a food novelty. The millions of 17-year cicadas that periodically plague northeastern states are edible. Newly hatched cicadas, called tenerals, are best for eating because their soft body cuticle means that they can be consumed without first removing the legs and wings. These tasty morsels can be marinated or dipped in batter and then deep-fried, boiled and spiced, roasted and ground, or stir-fried with favourite seasonings.
Large-scale harvest or mass production of insects for human consumption brings some practical and other problems. The small size of most insects presents difficulties in collection or rearing and in processing for sale. The unpredictability of many wild populations needs to be overcome by the development of culture techniques, especially as over-harvesting from the wild could threaten the viability of some insect populations. Another problem is that not all insect species are safe to eat. Warningly coloured insects are often distasteful or toxic (Chapter 14) and some people can develop allergies to insect material (section 15.6.3). However, several advantages derive from eating insects. The encouragement of entomophagy in many rural societies, particularly those with a history of insect use, may help diversify peoples’ diets. By incorporating mass-harvesting of pest insects into control programmes, the use of pesticides can be reduced. Furthermore, if carefully regulated, cultivating insects for protein should be less environmentally

damaging than cattle ranching, which devastates forests and native grasslands. Insect farming (the rearing of mini-livestock) is compatible with low-input sustainable agriculture and most insects have a high food conversion efficiency compared with conventional meat animals. However, the unregulated harvesting of wild insects can, and is, causing conservation concerns, especially in parts of Asia and Africa, where populations of some edible insects are threatened by over-collection as well as by habitat loss.
1.8.2 Insects as feed for domesticated animals
Although many people do not relish the prospect of eating insects, the concept of insects as a protein source for domesticated animals is quite acceptable. The nutritive significance of insects as feed for fish, poultry, pigs, and farm-grown mink certainly is recognized in China, where feeding trials have shown that insect-derived diets can be cost-effective alternatives to more conventional fishmeal diets. The insects involved are primarily the pupae of silkworms (Bombyx mori), the larvae and pupae of house flies (Musca domestica), and the larvae of mealworms (Tenebrio molitor). The same or related insects are being used or investigated elsewhere, particularly as poultry or fish feedstock. Silkworm pupae, a by-product of the silk industry, provide a high-protein supplement for chickens. In India, poultry are fed the meal that remains after the oil has been extracted from the pupae. Fly larvae fed to chickens can recycle animal manure, and development of insect recycling systems for converting organic wastes into feed supplements is ongoing (see Box. 9.1).
Clearly, insects have the potential to form part of the nutritional base of people and their domesticated animals. Further research is needed, and a database with accurate identifications is required to handle biological information. We must know which species we are dealing with in order to make use of information gathered elsewhere on the same or related insects. Data on the nutritional value, seasonal occurrence, host plants, or other dietary requirements, and rearing or collecting methods must be collated for all actual or potential food insects. Opportunities for insect food enterprises are numerous, given the immense diversity of insects.

The cuticle 27

Insects are segmented invertebrates that possess the articulated external skeleton (exoskeleton) characteristic of all arthropods. Groups are differentiated by various modifications of the exoskeleton and the appendages – for example, the Hexapoda to which the Insecta belong (section 7.2) is characterized by having six-legged adults. Many anatomical features of the appendages, especially of the mouthparts, legs, wings and abdominal apex, are important in recognizing the higher groups within the hexapods, including insect orders, families and genera. Differences between species frequently are indicated by less obvious anatomical differences. Furthermore, the biomechanical analysis of morphology (e.g. studying how insects fly or feed) depends on a thorough knowledge of structural features. Clearly, an understanding of external anatomy is necessary in order to interpret and appreciate the functions of the various insect designs and to allow identification of insects and their hexapod relatives. In this chapter, we describe and discuss the cuticle, body segmentation and the structure of the head, thorax and abdomen and their appendages.
Knowledge of the following basic classification and terms is fundamental to the information that follows in this chapter. Adult insects normally have wings (most of the Pterygota), the structure of which may diagnose orders, but there is a group of primitively wingless insects (the “apterygotes”) (see section 7.4.1 and Taxobox 2 for defining features). Within the Insecta, three major patterns of development can be recognized (section 6.2). Apterygotes (and non-insect hexapods) develop to adulthood with little change in body form (ametaboly), except for sexual maturation through development of gonads and genitalia. All other insects either have a gradual change in body form (hemimetaboly), with external wing buds getting larger at each moult, or an abrupt change from a wingless immature insect to a winged adult stage via a pupal stage (holometaboly). Immature stages of hemimetabolous insects are generally called nymphs, whereas those of holometabolous insects are referred to as larvae.
Anatomical structures of different taxa are homologous if they share an evolutionary origin, i.e. if the genetic basis is inherited from an ancestor common

to them both. For instance, the wings of all insects are believed to be homologous; this means that wings (but not necessarily flight; see section 8.4) originated once. Homology of structures generally is inferred by comparison of similarity in ontogeny (development from egg to adult), composition (size and detailed appearance) and position (on the same segment and same relative location on that segment). The homology of insect wings is demonstrated by similarities in venation and articulation – the wings of all insects can be derived from the same basic pattern or ground-plan (as explained in section 2.4.2). Sometimes association with other structures of known homologies is helpful in establishing the homology of a structure of uncertain origin. Another sort of homology, called serial homology, refers to corresponding structures on different segments of an individual insect. Thus, the appendages of each body segment are serially homologous, although in living insects those on the head (antennae and mouthparts) are very different in appearance from those on the thorax (walking legs) and abdomen (genitalia and cerci). The way in which molecular developmental studies are confirming these serial homologies is described in Box 6.1.
2.1 THE CUTICLE
The cuticle is a key contributor to the success of the Insecta. This inert layer provides the strong exoskeleton of body and limbs, the apodemes (internal supports and muscle attachments) and wings, and acts as a barrier between living tissues and the environment. Internally, cuticle lines the tracheal tubes (section 3.5), some gland ducts and the foregut and hindgut of the digestive tract. Cuticle may range from rigid and armour-like, as in most adult beetles, to thin and flexible, as in many larvae. Restriction of water loss is a critical function of cuticle and is vital to the success of insects on land. The mechanical strength of the exoskeleton derives both from the chemical and physical characteristics of the cuticle (described below) and from the shape of various parts (plates, appendage segments, etc.) that can be curved, corrugated or tubular, often with stiffening flanges, ribs or other reinforcements.

The cuticle is thin, but its structure is complex and varies among different taxonomic groups, as well as through the development of an individual insect (e.g. larva versus pupa versus adult) and on different parts of its body. A single layer of cells, the epidermis, lies

beneath and secretes the cuticle, which consists of a thicker procuticle overlaid with thin epicuticle (Fig. 2.1). The epidermis and cuticle together form an integument – the outer covering of the living tissues of an insect. The epidermis is closely associated with

moulting – the events and processes leading up to and including ecdysis, i.e. the shedding of the old cuticle (section 6.3).
The epicuticle ranges from 1 to 4 μm in thickness, and typically consists (from internal to external) of: an inner epicuticle; an outer epicuticle (sometimes called the cuticulin layer); a lipid or wax layer; and a variably discrete cement layer. The chemistry of the epicuticle and its outer layers is vital in preventing dehydration, a function derived from water-repelling (hydrophobic) lipids, especially hydrocarbons. These compounds include free and protein-bound lipids, and the outermost waxy coatings give a bloom to the external surface of some insects. Other cuticular patterns, such as light reflectivity, are produced by various kinds of epicuticular surface microsculpturing, such as close-packed, regular or irregular tubercles, ridges or tiny hairs. Lipid composition can vary, and waxiness can increase seasonally or under dry conditions. Besides being water retentive, surface waxes may deter predation, provide patterns for mimicry or camouflage, repel excess rainwater, reflect solar and ultraviolet radiation, or give species-specific olfactory cues (see sections 4.3.2 and 7.1.2).
The epicuticle is inextensible and unsupportive. Instead, support is given by the underlying chitinous cuticle, which is known as procuticle when it is first secreted. This differentiates into a thicker endocuticle covered by a thinner exocuticle, due to sclerotization of the latter. The procuticle is from 10 μm to 0.5 mm thick and consists primarily of chitin complexed with protein. This contrasts with the overlying epicuticle, which lacks chitin. There is a diversity of cuticular proteins, from 10 to more than 100 kinds in any particular type of cuticle, with hard cuticles having different proteins to flexible cuticles. Different insect species have different proteins in their cuticle. This variation in protein composition contributes to the specific characteristics of different cuticles.
Chitin is found as a supporting element in fungal cell walls as well as in arthropod exoskeletons. It is an unbranched polymer of high molecular weight – an amino polysaccharide predominantly composed of -(1–4)-linked units of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (Fig. 2.2). Chitin molecules are grouped into bundles and assembled into flexible microfibrils that are embedded in, and intimately linked to, a protein matrix, giving great tensile strength. The commonest arrangement of chitin microfibrils is in a sheet, in which the microfibrils are in parallel. In the exocuticle, each successive sheet

lies in the same plane but may be orientated at a slight angle relative to the previous sheet, such that a thickness of many sheets produces a helicoid arrangement, which in sectioned cuticle appears as alternating light and dark bands (lamellae). Thus, the parabolic patterns and lamellar arrangement, visible so clearly in sectioned cuticle, represent an optical artefact resulting from microfibrillar orientation (Fig. 2.3). In the endocuticle, alternate stacked or helicoid arrangements of microfibrillar sheets may occur, often giving rise to thicker lamellae than in the exocuticle. Different

arrangements may be laid down during darkness compared with during daylight, allowing precise age determination in many adult insects.
Much of the strength of cuticle comes from extensive hydrogen bonding of adjacent chitin chains. Additional stiffening comes from sclerotization, an irreversible process that darkens the exocuticle and results in the proteins becoming water-insoluble. Sclerotization may result from linkages of adjacent protein chains by phenolic bridges (quinone tanning) or from controlled dehydration of the chains, or both mechanisms acting together. Only exocuticle becomes sclerotized. The deposition of pigment in the cuticle, including deposition of melanin, may be associated with quinones, but is additional to sclerotization and not necessarily associated with it. The extreme hardness of the cutting edge of some insect mandibles is correlated with the presence of zinc and/or manganese in the cuticle.
In contrast to the solid cuticle typical of sclerites and mouthparts such as mandibles, softer, plastic, highly flexible or truly elastic cuticles occur in insects in varying locations and proportions. Where elastic or spring-like movement occurs, such as in wing ligaments or for the jump of a flea, resilin – a “rubber-like” protein – is present. The coiled polypeptide chains of this protein function as a mechanical spring under tension or compression, or in bending.
In soft-bodied larvae and in the membranes between segments, the cuticle must be tough, but also flexible and capable of extension. This “soft” cuticle, sometimes termed arthrodial membrane, is evident in gravid females, for example in the ovipositing migratory locust, Locusta migratoria (Orthoptera: Acrididae), in which intersegmental membranes may be expanded up to 20-fold for oviposition. Similarly, the gross abdominal dilation of gravid queen termites (see Plate 6c), bees and ants is possible through expansion of the unsclerotized cuticle. In these insects, the overlying unstretchable epicuticle expands by unfolding from an originally highly folded state, and some new epicuticle is formed. An extreme example of the distensibility of arthrodial membrane is seen in honeypot ants (Fig. 2.4; see also Plate 2h and section 12.2.3). In Rhodnius nymphs (Hemiptera: Reduviidae), changes in molecular structure of the cuticle allow actual stretching of the abdominal membrane to occur in response to intake of a large fluid volume during feeding.

The arthrodial membrane between tergal plates is depicted to the right in its unfolded and folded conditions. (After Hadley 1986; Devitt 1989.)
Cuticular structural components, waxes, cements, pheromones (Chapter 4) and defensive and other compounds are products either of the epidermis, which is a near-continuous, single-celled layer beneath the cuticle, or of secretory cells associated with the epidermis. Many of these compounds are secreted to the outside of the insect epicuticle. Numerous fine pore canals traverse the procuticle and then branch into numerous finer wax canals (containing wax filaments) within the epicuticle (see enlargement in Fig. 2.1); this system transports lipids (waxes) from the epidermis to the epicuticular surface. The wax canals may also have a structural role within the epicuticle. Dermal glands (exocrine glands) associated with the epidermis may produce cement and/or wax or other products, which are transported from the secretory cells via ducts to the surface of the cuticle or to a reservoir that opens at the surface. Wax-secreting glands are particularly well developed in mealybugs and other scale insects (Fig. 2.5). Ants also have an impressive number of exocrine glands, with 20 different types identified from the legs alone.

Fig. 2.6 The four basic types of cuticular protuberances: (a) a multicellular spine; (b) a seta, or trichoid sensillum; (c) acanthae; and (d) microtrichia. (After Richards & Richards 1979.)

Insects are well endowed with cuticular extensions, varying from fine and hair-like to robust and spine-like. Four basic types of protuberance (Fig. 2.6), all with sclerotized cuticle, can be recognized: 1 spines are multicellular with undifferentiated epidermal cells; 2 setae, also called hairs, macrotrichia or trichoid sensilla, are multicellular with specialized cells; 3 acanthae are unicellular in origin; 4 microtrichia are subcellular, with several to many extensions per cell.
Setae sense much of the insect’s tactile environment. Large setae may be called bristles or chaetae, with the most modified being scales, the flattened setae found on butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) and sporadically elsewhere in the insects. Three separate cells form each seta, one for hair formation (trichogen cell), one for socket formation (tormogen cell) and one sensory cell (see Fig. 4.1).
There is no such cellular differentiation in multicellular spines, unicellular acanthae, or subcellular microtrichia. The functions of these types of protuberances are diverse and sometimes debatable, but their sensory function appears limited. The production of pattern, including colour, may be significant for some of the microscopic projections. Spines are immovable, but if they are articulated, then they are called spurs. Both spines and spurs may bear unicellular or subcellular processes.

2.1.1 Colour production
The diverse colours of insects are produced by the interaction of light with the cuticle and/or underlying cells or fluid by two different mechanisms. Physical (structural) colours result from light scattering, interference and diffraction, whereas pigmentary colours are due to the absorption of visible light by a range of chemicals. Often both mechanisms occur together to produce a colour different from that produced by either mechanism alone.
All physical colours derive from the cuticle and its protuberances. Interference colours, such as iridescence and ultraviolet, are produced by refraction from varyingly spaced, close reflective layers produced by microfibrillar orientation within the exocuticle, or, in some beetles, the epicuticle, and by diffraction from regularly textured surfaces such as on many scales. Colours produced by light scattering depend on the size of surface irregularities relative to the wavelength of light. Thus, whites are produced by structures larger than the wavelength of light, such that all light is reflected, whereas blues are produced by irregularities that reflect only short wavelengths. The black colour on the wings of some butterflies, such as Papilio ulysses (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae), is produced by the absorption of most light by a combination of light-absorbing pigments and specially structured wing scales that prevent light from being scattered or reflected.

Insect pigments are produced in three ways: 1 by the insect’s own metabolism; 2 by sequestering from a plant source; 3 by microbial endosymbionts (rarely).
Pigments may be located in the cuticle, epidermis, haemolymph or fat body. Cuticular darkening is the most ubiquitous insect colour. This may be due to either sclerotization (unrelated to pigmentation) or the exocuticular deposition of melanins, a group of polymers that may give a black, brown, yellow or red colour. Carotenoids, ommochromes, papiliochromes and pteridines (pterins) mostly produce yellows to reds, flavonoids give yellow, and tetrapyrroles (including breakdown products of porphyrins such as chlorophyll and haemoglobin) create reds, blues and greens. Quinone pigments occur in scale insects as red and yellow anthraquinones (e.g. carmine from cochineal insects), and in aphids as yellow to red to dark blue-green or black aphins.
Colours have an array of functions in addition to the obvious roles of colour patterns in sexual and defensive display. For example, the ommochromes are the main visual pigments of insect eyes, whereas black melanin, an effective screen for possibly harmful light rays, can convert light energy into heat and may act as a sink for free radicals that could otherwise damage cells. The red haemoglobins, which are widespread respiratory pigments in vertebrates, occur in a few insects, notably in some midge larvae and a few aquatic bugs, in which they have a similar respiratory function.

Segmentation and tagmosis 33

2.2 SEGMENTATION AND TAGMOSIS
Metameric segmentation, so distinctive in annelids, is visible only in some unsclerotized larvae (Fig. 2.7a). The segmentation seen in the sclerotized adult or nymphal insect is not directly homologous with that of larval insects, as sclerotization extends beyond each primary segment (Fig. 2.7b,c). Each apparent segment represents an area of sclerotization that commences in front of the fold that demarcates the primary segment and extends almost to the rear of that segment, leaving an unsclerotized area of the primary segment, the conjunctival or intersegmental membrane. This secondary segmentation means that the muscles, which are always inserted on the folds, are attached to solid rather than to soft cuticle. The apparent segments of adult insects, such as on the abdomen, are secondary in origin, but we refer to them simply as segments throughout this book.

(d) Longitudinal section of dorsum of the thorax of winged insects, in which the acrotergites of the second and third segments have enlarged to become the postnota. (After Snodgrass 1935.)
In adult and nymphal insects, and hexapods in general, one of the most striking external features is the amalgamation of segments into functional units. This process of tagmosis has given rise to the familiar tagmata (regions) of head, thorax and abdomen. In this process, the 20 original segments have been divided into an embryologically detectable

34 External anatomy

six-segmented head, three-segmented thorax and 11-segmented abdomen (plus primitively the telson), although varying degrees of fusion mean that the full complement is never visible.
An understanding of orientation is needed to discuss external morphology in more detail. The bilaterally symmetrical body may be described according to three axes: 1 longitudinal, or anterior to posterior, also termed cephalic (head) to caudal (tail); 2 dorsoventral, or dorsal (upper) to ventral (lower);

3 transverse, or lateral (outer) through the longitudinal axis to the opposite lateral (Fig. 2.8).
For appendages, such as legs or wings, proximal or basal refers to near the body, whereas distal or apical means distant from the body. In addition, structures are mesal or medial if they are nearer to the midline, or lateral if they are closer to the body margin, relative to other structures.
Four principal regions of the body surface can be recognized: the dorsum or upper surface; the venter or lower surface; and the two lateral pleura (singular: pleuron), separating the dorsum from the venter and

The head 35

bearing limb bases, if these are present. Sclerotization that takes place in defined areas gives rise to plates called sclerites. The major segmental sclerites are the tergum (the dorsal plate; plural: terga), the sternum (the ventral plate; plural: sterna) and the pleuron (the side plate). If a sclerite is a subdivision of the tergum, sternum or pleuron, the diminutive terms tergite, sternite and pleurite may be applied.
The abdominal pleura are often at least partly membranous, but on the thorax they are sclerotized and usually linked to the tergum and sternum of each segment. This fusion forms a box, which contains the leg muscle insertions and, in winged insects, the flight muscles. With the exception of some larvae, the head sclerites are fused into a rigid capsule. In larvae (but not nymphs), the thorax and abdomen may remain membranous, tagmosis may be less apparent (such as

in most wasp larvae and fly maggots), and the terga, sterna and pleura are rarely distinct.
2.3 THE HEAD
The rigid cranial capsule has two openings, one posteriorly through the occipital foramen to the prothorax, the other to the mouthparts. Typically, the mouthparts are directed ventrally (hypognathous), although sometimes anteriorly (prognathous) as in many beetles, or posteriorly (opisthognathous) as in, for example, aphids, cicadas and leafhoppers. Several regions can be recognized on the head (Fig. 2.9): the posterior horseshoe-shaped posterior cranium (dorsally the occiput) contacts the vertex dorsally and the genae (singular: gena) laterally; the vertex abuts the

36 External anatomy

frons anteriorly and more anteriorly lies the clypeus, both of which may be fused into a frontoclypeus. In adult and nymphal insects, paired compound eyes lie more or less dorsolaterally between the vertex and genae, with a pair of sensory antennae placed more medially. In many insects, three light-sensitive “simple” eyes, or ocelli (singular: ocellus), are situated on the anterior vertex, typically arranged in a triangle, and many larvae have stemmatal eyes.
The head regions are often somewhat weakly delimited, with some indications of their extent coming from sutures (external grooves or lines on the head). Three sorts of suture may be recognized: 1 remnants of original segmentation, generally restricted to the postoccipital suture; 2 ecdysial lines of weakness where the head capsule of the immature insect splits at moulting (section 6.3), including an often prominent inverted “Y”, or epicranial suture, on the vertex (Fig. 2.10); the frons is delimited by the arms (also called frontal sutures) of this “Y”; 3 grooves that reflect the underlying internal skeletal ridges, such as the frontoclypeal or epistomal suture, which often delimits the frons from the more anterior clypeus.
The head endoskeleton consists of several invaginated ridges and arms (apophyses, or elongate apodemes), the most important of which are the two pairs of tentorial arms, one pair being posterior, the other anterior, sometimes with an additional dorsal component. Some of these arms may be absent or, in pterygotes, fused to form the tentorium, an endoskeletal strut. Pits are discernible on the surface of the cranium at the points where the tentorial arms invaginate. These pits and the sutures may provide prominent landmarks on the head but usually they bear little or no association with the segments.
The segmental origin of the head is most clearly demonstrated by the mouthparts (section 2.3.1). From anterior to posterior, there are six fused head segments: 1 preantennal (or ocular); 2 antennal, with each antenna equivalent to an entire leg; 3 labral (previously sometimes called the intercalary segment; see section 2.3.1); 4 mandibular; 5 maxillary; 6 labial.

The neck is mainly derived from the first part of the thorax and is not a segment.
2.3.1 Mouthparts
The mouthparts are formed from appendages of head segments 3–6. In omnivorous insects, such as cockroaches, crickets and earwigs, the mouthparts are of a biting and chewing type (mandibulate) and resemble the probable basic design of ancestral pterygote insects more closely than do the mouthparts of the majority of modern insects. Extreme modifications of basic mouthpart structure, correlated with feeding specializations, occur in most Lepidoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera and a number of the smaller orders. Here, we first discuss basic mandibulate mouthparts, as exemplified by the European earwig, Forficula auricularia (Dermaptera: Forficulidae) (Fig. 2.10), and then describe some of the more common modifications associated with more specialized diets.
There are five basic components of the mouthparts: 1 labrum, or “upper lip”, with a ventral surface called the epipharynx; 2 hypopharynx, a tongue-like structure; 3 mandibles, or jaws; 4 maxillae (singular: maxilla); 5 labium, or “lower lip” (Fig. 2.10).
The labrum forms the roof of the preoral cavity and mouth (see Fig. 3.14) and covers the base of the mandibles. Until recently, the labrum generally was considered to be associated with head segment 1. However, recent studies of the embryology, gene expression and nerve supply of the labrum show that it is innervated by the tritocerebrum of the brain (the fused ganglia of the third head segment) and is formed from fusion of parts of a pair of ancestral appendages on head segment 3. Projecting forwards from the back of the preoral cavity is the hypopharynx, a lobe of uncertain origin, but perhaps associated with the mandibular segment; in apterygotes, earwigs and nymphal mayflies the hypopharynx bears a pair of lateral lobes, the superlinguae (singular: superlingua) (Fig. 2.10). It divides the cavity into a dorsal food pouch, or

cibarium, and a ventral salivarium into which the salivary duct opens (see Fig. 3.14). The mandibles, maxillae and labium are the paired appendages of segments 4–6 and are highly variable in structure among insect orders; their serial homology with walking legs is more apparent than for the labrum and hypopharynx.
The mandibles cut and crush food and may be used for defence. Generally, they have an apical cutting edge and the more basal molar area grinds the food. They can be extremely hard (approximately 3 on Moh’s scale of mineral hardness, or an indentation hardness of about 30 kg mm−2) and thus many termites and beetles have no physical difficulty in boring through foils made from common metals such as copper, lead, tin and zinc. Behind the mandibles lie the maxillae, each consisting of a basal part composed of the proximal cardo and the more distal stipes and, attached to the stipes, two lobes – the mesal lacinia and the lateral galea – and a lateral, segmented maxillary palp, or palpus (plural: palps or palpi). Functionally, the maxillae assist the mandibles in processing food; the pointed and sclerotized lacinae hold and macerate the food, whereas the galeae and palps bear sensory setae (mechanoreceptors) and chemoreceptors that sample items before ingestion. The appendages of the sixth segment of the head are fused with the sternum to form the labium, which is believed to be homologous to the second maxillae of Crustacea. In prognathous insects, such as the earwig, the labium attaches to the ventral surface of the head via a ventromedial sclerotized plate called the gula (Fig. 2.10). There are two main parts to the labium: the proximal postmentum, closely connected to the posteroventral surface of the head and sometimes subdivided into a submentum and mentum; and the free distal prementum, typically bearing a pair of labial palps lateral to two pairs of lobes, the mesal glossae (singular: glossa) and the more lateral paraglossae (singular: paraglossa). The glossae and paraglossae, including sometimes the distal part of the prementum to which they attach, are known collectively as the ligula; the lobes may be variously fused or reduced as in Forficula (Fig. 2.10), in which the glossae are absent. The prementum with its lobes forms the floor of the preoral cavity (functionally a “lower lip”), whereas the labial palps have a sensory function, similar to that of the maxillary palps.
During insect evolution, an array of different mouthpart types have been derived from the basic design described above. Often, feeding structures are characteristic of all members of a genus, family or order of insects, so that knowledge of mouthparts is useful

for both taxonomic classification and identification, and for ecological generalization (section 10.6). Generally, mouthpart structure is categorized according to feeding method, but mandibles and other components may function in defensive combat or even male–male sexual contests, as in the enlarged mandibles on certain male beetles (Lucanidae). Insect mouthparts have diversified in different orders, with feeding methods that include lapping, suctorial feeding, biting, or piercing combined with sucking, and filter feeding, in addition to the basic chewing mode.
The mouthparts of bees are of a chewing and lapping-sucking type. Lapping is a mode of feeding in which liquid or semi-liquid food adhering to a protrusible organ, or “tongue”, is transferred from substrate to mouth. In the honey bee, Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae), the elongate and fused labial glossae form a hairy tongue, which is surrounded by the maxillary galeae and the labial palps to form a tubular proboscis containing a food canal (Fig. 2.11). In feeding, the

The head 39

tongue is dipped into the nectar or honey, which adheres to the hairs, and then is retracted so that adhering liquid is carried into the space between the galeae and labial palps. This back-and-forth glossal movement occurs repeatedly. Movement of liquid to the mouth apparently results from the action of the cibarial pump, facilitated by each retraction of the tongue pushing liquid up the food canal. The maxillary laciniae and palps are rudimentary and the paraglossae embrace the base of the tongue, directing saliva from the dorsal salivary orifice around into a ventral channel from whence it is transported to the ﬂabellum, a small lobe at the glossal tip; saliva may dissolve solid or semi-solid sugar. The sclerotized, spoon-shaped mandibles lie at the base of the proboscis and have a variety of functions, including the manipulation of wax and plant resins for nest construction, the feeding of larvae and the queen, grooming, fighting and the removal of nest debris, including dead bees.
Most adult Lepidoptera, and some adult flies, obtain their food solely by sucking up liquids using suctorial (haustellate) mouthparts that form a proboscis or rostrum (Fig. 2.12, Fig. 2.13 and Fig. 2.14). Pumping

of the liquid food is achieved by muscles of the cibarium and/or pharynx. The proboscis of moths and butterflies, formed from the greatly elongated maxillary galeae, is extended (Fig. 2.12a) by increases in haemolymph (“blood”) pressure. It is loosely coiled by the inherent elasticity of the cuticle, but tight coiling requires contraction of intrinsic muscles (Fig. 2.12b). A cross-section of the proboscis (Fig. 2.12c) shows how the food canal, which opens basally into the cibarial pump, is formed by apposition and interlocking of the two galeae. The proboscis of most adult lepidopterans is very obvious (see Plate 3a and Plate 5g), and that of some male hawkmoths (Sphingidae), such as Xanthopan morgani, can attain great length (see Fig. 11.7).
A few moths, and many flies, combine sucking with piercing or biting. For example, moths that pierce fruit and exceptionally suck blood (some species of Noctuidae) have spines and hooks at the tip of their proboscis that are rasped against the skin of either ungulate mammals or fruit. For at least some moths, penetration is effected by the alternate protraction and retraction of the two galeae that slide along each other.

All dipterans typically have a tubular sucking organ, the proboscis, comprising elongate mouthparts (usually including the labrum) (Fig. 2.13a). A bitingand-sucking type of proboscis appears to be a primitive dipteran feature. Although biting functions have been lost and regained with modifications more than once, blood feeding is frequent, and leads to the importance of the Diptera as vectors of disease. Blood-feeding flies have a variety of skin-penetration and feeding mechanisms. In the horse flies (Brachycera: Tabanidae), the labium of the adult fly forms a non-piercing sheath for the other mouthparts, which together contribute to the piercing structure. In contrast, the biting calyptrate dipterans (Brachycera: Calyptratae, e.g. stable flies and tsetse flies) lack mandibles and maxillae and the principal piercing organ is the highly modified labium.
The blood-feeding female nematocerans – Culicidae (mosquitoes), Ceratopogonidae (biting midges), Psychodidae: Phlebotominae (sand flies) and Simuliidae (black flies) – have generally similar mouthparts, but differ in proboscis length, allowing penetration of the host to different depths. Mosquitoes can probe deep in search of capillaries, but other blood-feeding nematocerans operate more superficially, where a pool of blood is induced in the wound. The labium, which ends in two sensory labella (singular: labellum), forms a protective sheath for the functional mouthparts (Fig. 2.13a). Enclosed are serrate-edged, cutting mandibles and maxillary lacinia, the curled labrum-epipharynx and the hypopharynx, all of which are often termed stylets (Fig. 2.13b). When feeding, the labrum, mandibles and laciniae act as a single unit driven through the skin of the host. The flexible labium remains bowed outside the wound. Saliva, which may contain anticoagulant, is injected through a salivary duct that runs the length of the sharply pointed and often toothed hypopharynx. Blood is transported up a food canal formed from the curled labrum sealed by either the paired mandibles or the hypopharynx. Capillary blood can flow unaided, but blood must be sucked or pumped from a pool via a pumping action from two muscular pumps: the cibarial located at the base of the food canal, and the pharyngeal in the pharynx between the cibarium and midgut.

Fig. 2.14 Mouthparts of adult Diptera. (a) House fly, Musca (Muscidae). (b) Stable fly, Stomoxys (Muscidae). (After Wigglesworth 1964.)
Many mouthparts are lost in brachyceran flies, and the remaining mouthparts are modified for lapping food using pseudotracheae of the labella as “sponges”, as in a house fly (Muscidae: Musca) (Fig. 2.14a). With neither mandibles nor maxillary lacinia to make a wound, blood-feeding cyclorrhaphans often use modified labella in which the inner surfaces are adorned with sharp teeth, as in stable flies (Muscidae: Stomoxys) (Fig. 2.14b). Through muscular contraction and relaxation, the labellar lobes dilate and contract repeatedly, creating an often painful rasping of the labellar teeth to create a pool of blood. The hypopharynx applies saliva, which is dissipated via the labellar pseudotracheae.

Uptake of blood is via capillary action through “food furrows” lying dorsal to the pseudotracheae, with the aid of three pumps operating synchronously to produce continuous suction from labella to pharynx. A prelabral pump produces the contractions in the labella, with a more proximal labral pump linked via a feeding tube to the cibarial pump.
The mouthparts of adult flies and how they are used in feeding have implications for disease transmission. Shallow-feeding species such as black flies are more involved in transmission of microfilariae, such as those of Onchocerca (section 15.3.6), which aggregate just beneath the skin, whereas deeper feeders such as mosquitoes transmit pathogens that circulate in the blood, as in malaria (section 15.3.1). The transmission from fly to host is aided by the introduction of saliva into the wound, and many parasites aggregate in the salivary glands or ducts. Filariae, in contrast, are too large to enter the wound through this route, and leave the insect host by rupturing the labium or labella during feeding.
Other mouthpart modifications for piercing and sucking are seen in the true bugs (Hemiptera), thrips (Thysanoptera), fleas (Siphonaptera) and sucking lice (Psocodea: Anoplura). In each of these orders, different mouthpart components form needle-like stylets capable of piercing the plant or animal tissues upon which the insect feeds. Bugs have extremely long, thin, paired mandibular and maxillary stylets, which fit together to form a flexible stylet-bundle containing a food canal and a salivary canal (Taxobox 20). Thrips have three stylets – paired maxillary stylets (laciniae) plus the left mandibular one (Fig. 2.15). Sucking lice have three stylets – the hypopharyngeal (dorsal), the salivary (median) and the labial (ventral) – lying in a ventral sac on the head and opening at a small eversible proboscis armed with internal teeth that grip the host during blood-feeding (Fig. 2.16). Fleas possess a single stylet derived from the epipharynx, and the laciniae of the maxillae form two long cutting blades that are ensheathed by the labial palps (Fig. 2.17). The Hemiptera and the Thysanoptera are sister groups and belong to the same assemblage as the Psocodea (see Fig. 7.5), with the lice originating from a psocid-like ancestor with mouthparts of a more

generalized, mandibulate type. The Siphonaptera are distant relatives of the other three taxa; thus similarities in mouthpart structure among these orders result largely from parallel or, in the case of fleas, convergent evolution.
Slightly different piercing mouthparts are found in antlions and the predatory larvae of other lacewings (Neuroptera). The stylet-like mandible and maxilla on each side of the head fit together to form a sucking tube (see Fig. 13.2c), and in some families (Chrysopidae, Myrmeleontidae and Osmylidae) there is also a narrow poison channel. Generally, labial palps are present,

maxillary palps are absent, and the labrum is reduced. Prey is seized by the pointed mandibles and maxillae, which are inserted into the victim; its body contents are digested extra-orally and sucked up by pumping of the cibarium.
A unique modification of the labium for prey capture occurs in nymphal damselflies and dragonflies (Odonata). These predators catch other aquatic organisms by extending their folded labium (or “mask”) rapidly and seizing mobile prey using prehensile apical hooks on modified labial palps (see Fig. 13.4). The labium is hinged between the prementum and postmentum and, when folded, covers most of the underside of the head. Labial extension involves the sudden release of energy, produced by increases in blood pressure brought about by the contraction of thoracic and abdominal muscles, and stored elastically in a cuticular

setal “brushes” and/or “fans”, which generate feeding currents or trap particulate matter and then move it to the mouth. In contrast, the caddisflies spin silk nets that filter particulate matter from flowing water and then use their mouthpart brushes to remove particles from the nets. Thus, insect mouthparts are modified for filter feeding chiefly by the elaboration of setae. In mosquito larvae, the lateral palatal brushes on the labrum generate the feeding currents (Fig. 2.18); they beat actively, causing particle-rich surface water to flow towards the mouthparts, where setae on the mandibles and maxillae help to move particles into the pharynx, where food boluses form at intervals.
In some adult insects, such as mayflies (Ephemeroptera), some Diptera (warble flies), a few moths (Lepidoptera) and male scale insects (Hemiptera: Coccoidea), mouthparts are greatly reduced and nonfunctional. Atrophied mouthparts correlate with short adult lifespan.

click mechanism at the prementum–postmentum joint. As the click mechanism is disengaged, the elevated hydraulic pressure shoots the labium rapidly forwards. Labial retraction then brings the captured prey to the other mouthparts for maceration.
Filter feeding in aquatic insects has been studied best in larval mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae), black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae) and net-spinning caddisflies (Trichoptera: many Hydropsychoidea and Philopotamoidea), which obtain their food by filtering particles (including bacteria, microscopic algae and detritus) from the water in which they live. The mouthparts of the dipteran larvae have an array of

2.3.2 Cephalic sensory structures
The most obvious sensory structures of insects are on the head. Most adults and many nymphs have compound eyes dorsolaterally on the head (probably derived from segment 1 of the head) and three ocelli on the vertex of the head. The median, or anterior, ocellus lies on the frons and is formed from a fused pair of ocelli; the two lateral ocelli are located more posteriorly on the head. The only visual structures of larval insects are stemmata (singular: stemma), or simple eyes, positioned laterally on the head, either singly or in clusters. The structure and functioning of these three types of visual organs are described in detail in section 4.4.
Antennae are mobile, segmented, paired appendages. Primitively, they appear to be eight-segmented in nymphs and adults, but often there are numerous subdivisions, sometimes called antennomeres. The entire antenna typically has three main divisions (Fig. 2.19a): the first segment, or scape, generally is larger than the other segments and is the basal stalk; the second segment, or pedicel, nearly always contains a sensory organ known as Johnston’s organ, which responds to movement of the distal part of the antenna relative to the pedicel; the remainder of the antenna, called the ﬂagellum, is often filamentous and multisegmented (with many ﬂagellomeres), but may be reduced or variously modified (Fig. 2.19b–i).

The antennae are reduced or almost absent in some larval insects.
Numerous sensory organs, or sensilla (singular: sensillum), in the form of hairs, pegs, pits or cones, occur on antennae and function as chemoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors and hygroreceptors (Chapter 4). Antennae of male insects may be more elaborate than those of the corresponding females, increasing the surface area available for detecting female sex pheromones (section 4.3.2).
The mouthparts, other than the mandibles, are well endowed with chemoreceptors and tactile setae. These sensilla are described in detail in Chapter 4.
2.4 THE THORAX
The thorax is composed of three segments: the first or prothorax; the second or mesothorax; and the third or metathorax. Primitively, and in apterygotes (bristletails and silverfish) and immature insects, these segments are similar in size and structural complexity. In most winged insects, the mesothorax and

metathorax are enlarged relative to the prothorax and form a pterothorax, bearing the wings and associated musculature. Wings occur only on the second and third segments in extant insects, although some fossils have prothoracic winglets (see Fig. 8.3) and homeotic mutants may develop prothoracic wings or wing buds. Almost all nymphal and adult insects have three pairs of thoracic legs – one pair per segment. Typically, the legs are used for walking, although various other functions and associated modifications occur (section 2.4.1). Openings (spiracles) of the gas-exchange, or tracheal, system (section 3.5) are present laterally on the second and third thoracic segments with at most one pair per segment. However, a secondary condition in some insects is for the mesothoracic spiracles to open on the prothorax.
The tergal plates of the thorax are simple structures in apterygotes and in many immature insects, but are variously modified in winged adults. Thoracic terga are called nota (singular: notum), to distinguish them from the abdominal terga. The pronotum of the prothorax may be simple in structure and small in comparison with the other nota, but in beetles,

mantids, many bugs and some Orthoptera, the pronotum is expanded, and in cockroaches it forms a shield that covers part of the head and mesothorax. The pterothoracic nota each have two main divisions – the anterior wing-bearing alinotum and the posterior phragma-bearing postnotum (Fig. 2.20). Phragmata (singular: phragma) are plate-like apodemes that extend inwards below the antecostal sutures, marking the primary intersegmental folds between

segments; phragmata provide attachment for the longitudinal flight muscles (Fig. 2.7d). Each alinotum (sometimes confusingly referred to as a “notum”) may be traversed by sutures that mark the position of internal strengthening ridges and commonly divide the plate into three areas – the anterior prescutum, the scutum, and the smaller posterior scutellum.
The lateral pleural sclerites may be derived from the subcoxal segment of the ancestral insect leg

Trim size: 189mm x 246mm

Gullan c02.tex V1 - 05/16/2014 1:41 P.M. Page 47

The thorax 47

(see Fig. 8.5a). These sclerites can be separate, as in silverfish, or fused into an almost continuous sclerotic area, as in most winged insects. In the pterothorax, the pleuron is divided into two main areas – the anterior episternum and the posterior epimeron – by an internal pleural ridge, which is visible externally as the pleural suture (Fig. 2.20). The pleural ridge runs from the pleural coxal process (which articulates with the coxa) to the pleural wing process (which articulates with the wing), providing reinforcement for these articulation points. The epipleurites are small sclerites beneath the wing and consist of the basalaria anterior to the pleural wing process and the posterior subalaria, but are often reduced to just one basalare and one subalare, which serve as attachment points for some direct flight muscles. The trochantin is the small sclerite anterior to the coxa.
The degree of ventral sclerotization on the thorax varies greatly in different insects. Sternal plates, if present, are typically two per segment: the eusternum, and the following intersegmental sclerite or intersternite (Fig. 2.7c), commonly called the spinasternum (Fig. 2.20) because it usually has an internal apodeme called the spina (except for the metasternum, which never has a spinasternum). The eusterna of the prothorax and mesothorax may fuse with the spinasterna of their segment. Each eusternum may be simple or divided into separate

sclerites – typically the presternum, basisternum and sternellum. The eusternum may be fused laterally with one of the pleural sclerites and is then called the laterosternite. Fusion of the sternal and pleural plates may form precoxal and postcoxal bridges (Fig. 2.20).
2.4.1 Legs
In most adult and nymphal insects, segmented fore, mid and hind legs occur on the prothorax, mesothorax and metathorax, respectively. Typically, each leg has six segments (Fig. 2.21) and these are, from proximal to distal: coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia, tarsus and pretarsus (or more correctly post-tarsus) with claws. Additional segments – the prefemur, patella and basitarsus (see Fig. 8.5a) – are recognized in some fossil insects and other arthropods, such as arachnids, and one or more of these segments are evident in some Ephemeroptera and Odonata. Primitively, two further segments lie proximal to the coxa, and in extant insects one of these, the epicoxa, is associated with the wing articulation or the tergum, and the other, the subcoxa, with the pleuron (Fig. 8.5a).
The tarsus is subdivided into five or fewer components, giving the impression of segmentation; but, because there is only one tarsal muscle, tarsomere

48 External anatomy

is a more appropriate term for each “pseudosegment”. The first tarsomere sometimes is called the basitarsus, but should not be confused with the segment called the basitarsus in certain fossil insects. The underside of the tarsomeres may have ventral pads, pulvilli, also called euplantulae, which assist in adhesion to surfaces. The surface of each pad is either setose (hairy) or smooth. Terminally on the leg, the small pretarsus (shown in the enlargement in Fig. 2.21) bears a pair of lateral claws (also called ungues) and usually a median lobe, the arolium. In Diptera, there may be a central spine-like or pad-like empodium (plural: empodia), which is not the same as the arolium, and a pair of lateral pulvilli (as shown for the bush fly, Musca vetustissima, depicted on the right side of the vignette at the beginning of this chapter). These structures allow flies to walk on walls and ceilings. The pretarsus of Hemiptera may bear a variety of structures, some of which appear to be pulvilli, whereas others have been called empodia or arolia, but the homologies are uncertain. In some beetles, such as Coccinellidae, Chrysomelidae and Curculionidae, the ventral surface of some tarsomeres is clothed with adhesive setae that facilitate climbing. The left side of the vignette at the beginning of this chapter shows the underside of the tarsus of the leaf beetle Rhyparida (Chrysomelidae).
Generally, the femur and tibia are the longest leg segments, but variations in the lengths and robustness of each segment relate to their functions. For example, walking (gressorial) and running (cursorial) insects usually have well-developed femora and tibiae on all legs, whereas jumping (saltatorial) insects such as grasshoppers have disproportionately developed hind femora and tibiae. In aquatic beetles (Coleoptera) and bugs (Hemiptera), the tibiae and/or tarsi of one or more pairs of legs usually are modified for swimming (natatorial), with fringes of long, slender hairs. Many ground-dwelling insects, such as mole crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllotalpidae), nymphal cicadas (Hemiptera: Cicadidae), and scarab beetles (Scarabaeidae), have the tibiae of the fore legs enlarged and modified for digging (fossorial) (see Fig. 9.2), whereas the fore legs of some predatory insects, such as mantispid lacewings (Neuroptera) and mantids (Mantodea), are specialized for seizing prey (raptorial) (see Fig. 13.3). The tibia and basal tarsomere of each hind leg of honey bees are modified for the collection and carriage of pollen (see Fig. 12.4).
These “typical” thoracic legs are a distinctive feature of insects, whereas abdominal legs are confined to the

immature stages of holometabolous insects. There have been conflicting views on whether the thoracic legs on the thorax of immature stages of the Holometabola are: (i) developmentally identical (serially homologous) to those of the abdomen; and/or (ii) homologous with those of the adult. Detailed study of musculature and innervation shows similarity of development of thoracic legs throughout all stages of insects with ametaboly (without metamorphosis, as in silverfish) and hemimetaboly (partial metamorphosis and no pupal stage) and in adult Holometabola, having identical innervation through the lateral nerves. Moreover, the oldest known larva (from the Upper Carboniferous) has thoracic and abdominal legs/leglets, each with a pair of claws, as in the legs of nymphs and adults. Although larval legs appear similar to those of adults and nymphs, the term proleg is used for the larval leg. Prolegs on the abdomen, especially on caterpillars, usually are lobe-like and each bears an apical circle or band of small sclerotized hooks, or crochets. The thoracic prolegs may possess the same number of segments as the adult leg, but the number is more often reduced, apparently through fusion. In other cases, the thoracic prolegs, like those of the abdomen, are unsegmented outgrowths of the body wall, often bearing apical hooks.
2.4.2 Wings
Wings are developed fully only in the adult, or exceptionally in the subimago, the penultimate stage of Ephemeroptera. Typically, functional wings are flap-like cuticular projections supported by tubular, sclerotized veins. The major veins are longitudinal, running from the wing base towards the tip, and are more concentrated at the anterior margin. Additional supporting cross-veins are transverse struts, which join the longitudinal veins to give a more complex structure. The major veins usually contain tracheae, blood vessels and nerve fibres, with the intervening membranous areas comprising the closely appressed dorsal and ventral cuticular surfaces. Generally, the major veins are alternately “convex” and “concave” in relation to the surface plane of the wing, especially near the wing attachment; this configuration is described by plus (+) and minus (−) signs. Most veins lie in an anterior area of the wing called the remigium (Fig. 2.22), which, powered by the thoracic flight muscles, is responsible for most of the movements of flight.

The thorax 49

Fig. 2.22 Nomenclature for the main areas, folds and margins of a generalized insect wing.

The area of wing posterior to the remigium is sometimes called the clavus, but more often two areas are recognized: an anterior anal area (or vannus) and a posterior jugal area (or jugum). Wing areas are delimited and subdivided by fold-lines, along which the wing can be folded, and ﬂexion-lines, at which the wing flexes during flight. The fundamental distinction between these two types of lines is often blurred, as fold-lines may permit some flexion, and vice versa. The claval furrow (a flexion-line) and the jugal fold (or fold-line) are nearly constant in position in different insect groups, but the median ﬂexion-line and the anal (or vannal) fold (or fold-line) form variable and unsatisfactory area boundaries. Wing folding may be very complicated; transverse folding occurs in the hind wings of Coleoptera and Dermaptera, and in some insects the enlarged anal area may be folded like a fan.
The fore and hind wings of insects in many orders are coupled together, which improves the aerodynamic efficiency of flight. The commonest coupling mechanism (seen clearly in Hymenoptera and some Trichoptera) is a row of small hooks, or hamuli, along the anterior margin of the hind wing that engages with a fold along the posterior margin of the fore wing (hamulate coupling). In some other insects (e.g. Mecoptera, Lepidoptera and some Trichoptera), a jugal lobe of the fore wing overlaps the anterior hind wing (jugate coupling), or the margins of the fore and hind wing overlap broadly (amplexiform coupling),

or one or more hind-wing bristles (the frenulum) hook under a retaining structure (the retinaculum) on the fore wing (frenate coupling). The mechanics of flight are described in section 3.1.4 and the evolution of wings is covered in section 8.4.
All winged insects share the same basic wing venation, comprising eight veins, named from anterior to posterior of the wing as: precosta (PC), costa (C), subcosta (Sc), radius (R), media (M), cubitus (Cu), anal (A) and jugal (J). Primitively, each vein has an anterior convex (+) sector (a branch with all of its subdivisions) and a posterior concave (−) sector. In almost all extant insects, the precosta is fused with the costa and the jugal vein is rarely apparent. The wing nomenclatural system presented in Fig. 2.23 is that of Kukalová-Peck and is based on detailed comparative studies of fossil and living insects. This system can be applied to the venation of all insect orders, although as yet it has not been widely applied because the various schemes devised for each insect order have a long history of use and there is a reluctance to discard familiar systems. Thus, in most textbooks, the same vein may be referred to by different names in different insect orders because the structural homologies were not recognized correctly in early studies. For example, until 1991, the venational scheme for Coleoptera labelled the radius posterior (RP) as the media (M) and the media posterior (MP) as the cubitus (Cu). Correct interpretation of venational homologies is essential for phylogenetic studies, and

Branches of the anterior and posterior sector of each vein are numbered, e.g. CuA1–4. (After CSIRO 1991.)

the establishment of a single, universally applied scheme is essential.
Cells are areas of the wing delimited by veins, and may be open (extending to the wing margin) or closed (surrounded by veins). They are named usually according to the longitudinal veins or vein branches that they lie behind, except that certain cells are known by special names, such as the discal cell in Lepidoptera (Fig. 2.24a) and the triangle in Odonata (Fig. 2.24b). The pterostigma is an opaque or pigmented spot anteriorly near the apex of the wing (Fig. 2.22, Fig. 2.23 and Fig. 2.24b).
Wing venation patterns are consistent within groups (especially families and orders) but often differ between groups and, together with folds or pleats, provide major features used in insect classification and identification. Relative to the basic scheme outlined above, venation may be greatly reduced by loss or postulated fusion of veins, or increased in complexity by numerous

cross-veins or substantial terminal branching. Other features that may be diagnostic of the wings of different insect groups are pigment patterns and colours, hairs and scales. Scales occur on the wings of Lepidoptera, many Trichoptera, and a few psocids (Psocodea) and flies, and may be highly coloured and have various functions, including waterproofing. Shedding of scales can allow escape from predators. Hairs consist of small microtrichia, either scattered or grouped, and larger macrotrichia, typically on the veins.
Usually, two pairs of functional wings lie dorsolaterally as fore wings on the mesothorax and as hind wings on the metathorax; typically the wings are membranous and transparent. However, from this basic pattern are derived many other conditions, often involving variation in the relative size, shape and degree of sclerotization of the fore and hind wings. Examples of fore-wing modification include: the thickened, leathery fore wings of Blattodea, Dermaptera

and Orthoptera, which are called tegmina (singular: tegmen; Fig. 2.24c); the hardened fore wings of Coleoptera that form protective wing cases or elytra (singular: elytron; Fig. 2.24d); and the hemelytra (singular: hemelytron) of heteropteran Hemiptera, with the basal part thickened and the apical part membranous (Fig. 2.24e). Typically, the heteropteran hemelytron is divided into three wing areas: the

membrane, corium and clavus. Sometimes the corium is divided further, with the embolium anterior to R+M, and the cuneus distal to a costal fracture. In Diptera the hind wings are modified as stabilizers (halteres) (Fig. 2.24f) and do not function as wings, whereas in male Strepsiptera the fore wings form halteres and the hind wings are used in flight (Taxobox 23). In male scale insects, the fore wings

52 External anatomy

have highly reduced venation and the hind wings form hamulohalteres (different in structure to the halteres) or are lost completely.
Small insects confront different aerodynamic challenges compared with larger insects and their wing area often is expanded to aid wind dispersal. Thrips (Thysanoptera), for example, have very slender wings but have a fringe of long setae or cilia to extend the wing area (Taxobox 19). In termites (Blattodea: Termitoidae) and ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), the winged reproductives, or alates, have large deciduous wings that are shed after the nuptial flight. Some insects are wingless, or apterous, either primitively as in silverfish (Zygentoma) and bristletails (Archaeognatha), which diverged from other insect lineages prior to the origin of wings, or secondarily as in all parasitic lice (Psocodea) and fleas (Siphonaptera), which evolved from winged ancestors. Secondary partial wing reduction occurs in a number of short-winged, or brachypterous, insects.
In all winged insects (Pterygota), a triangular area at the wing base, the axillary area (Fig. 2.22), contains the movable articular sclerites via which the wing articulates on the thorax. These sclerites are derived, by reduction and fusion, from a band of articular sclerites in the ancestral wing. Three different types of wing articulation among living Pterygota result from unique patterns of fusion and reduction of the articular sclerites. In Neoptera (all living winged insects except the Ephemeroptera and Odonata), the articular sclerites consist of the humeral plate, the tegula, and usually three, rarely four, axillary sclerites (1Ax, 2Ax, 3Ax and 4Ax) (Fig. 2.23). The Ephemeroptera and Odonata each has a different configuration of these sclerites compared with the Neoptera (literally meaning “new wing”). Odonate and ephemeropteran adults cannot fold their wings back along the abdomen, as can neopterans. In Neoptera, the wing articulates via the articular sclerites with the anterior and posterior wing processes dorsally, and ventrally with the pleural wing processes and two small pleural sclerites (the basalare and subalare) (Fig. 2.20).
2.5 THE ABDOMEN
Primitively, the insect abdomen is 11-segmented, although segment 1 may be reduced or incorporated into the thorax (as in many Hymenoptera) and the terminal segments usually are variously modified

and/or diminished (Fig. 2.25a). Generally, at least the first seven abdominal segments of adults (the pregenital segments) are similar in structure and lack appendages. However, apterygotes (bristletails and silverfish) and many immature aquatic insects have abdominal appendages. Apterygotes possess a pair of styles – rudimentary appendages that are serially homologous with the distal part of the thoracic legs – and, mesally, one or two pairs of protrusible (or exsertile) vesicles on at least some abdominal segments. These vesicles are derived from the coxal and trochanteral endites (inner annulated lobes) of the ancestral abdominal appendages (see Fig. 8.5b). Aquatic larvae and nymphs may have gills laterally on some to most abdominal segments (Chapter 10). Some of these may be serially homologous with thoracic wings (e.g. the plate gills of mayfly nymphs) or with other leg derivatives. Spiracles typically are present on segments 1–8, but reductions in number occur frequently in association with modifications of the tracheal system (section 3.5), especially in immature insects, and with specializations of the terminal segments in adults.
2.5.1 Terminalia
The anal-genital part of the abdomen, known as the terminalia, consists generally of segments 8 or 9 to the abdominal apex. Segments 8 and 9 bear the genitalia; segment 10 is visible as a complete segment in many “lower” insects but always lacks appendages; and the small segment 11 is represented by a dorsal epiproct and pair of ventral paraprocts derived from the sternum (Fig. 2.25b). A pair of appendages, the cerci (singular: cercus), articulates laterally on segment 11; typically these are annulated and filamentous, but have been modified (e.g. the forceps of earwigs) or reduced in different insect orders. An annulated caudal filament, the median appendix dorsalis, arises from the tip of the epiproct in apterygotes, most mayflies (Ephemeroptera) and a few fossil Insects. A similar structure in nymphal stoneflies (Plecoptera) is of uncertain homology. These terminal abdominal segments have excretory and sensory functions in all insects, but in adults there is an additional reproductive function.
The organs concerned specifically with mating and the deposition of eggs are known collectively as the external genitalia, although they may be largely internal. The components of the external genitalia of

insects are very diverse in form and often have considerable taxonomic value, particularly amongst species that appear structurally similar in other respects. The male external genitalia have been used widely to aid in distinguishing species, whereas the female external genitalia may be simpler and less varied. The diversity and species-specificity of genitalic structures are discussed in section 5.5.
The terminalia of adult female insects include internal structures for receiving the male copulatory organ and his spermatozoa (sections 5.4 and 5.6) and external structures used for oviposition (egg-laying;

section 5.8). Most female insects have an egg-laying tube, or ovipositor; it is absent in termites (Temitoidae), parasitic lice (Psocodea), female scale insects (Coccoidea), many Plecoptera and most Ephemeroptera. Ovipositors take two forms: 1 true, or appendicular ovipositor, formed from appendages of abdominal segments 8 and 9 (Fig. 2.25b); 2 substitutional ovipositor, composed of extensible posterior abdominal segments (Fig. 2.25a).
Substitutional ovipositors include a variable number of the terminal segments and clearly have been

derived convergently several times, even within some orders. They occur in many insects, including most Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Diptera. In these insects, the terminalia are telescopic and can be extended as a slender tube, manipulated by muscles attached to apodemes of the modified terga (Fig. 2.25a) and/or sterna.
Appendicular ovipositors represent the primitive condition for female insects and are present in Archaeognatha, Zygentoma, many Odonata, Orthoptera, some Hemiptera, some Thysanoptera and Hymenoptera. In some Hymenoptera, the ovipositor is modified as a poison-injecting sting (see Fig. 14.11) and the eggs are ejected at the base of the sting. In all other cases, the eggs pass down a canal in the shaft of the ovipositor (section 5.8). The shaft is composed of three pairs of valves (Fig. 2.25b,c) supported on two pairs of valvifers – the coxae plus trochanters, or gonocoxites, of segments 8 and 9 (Fig. 2.25b). The gonocoxites of segment 8 have a pair of trochanteral endites (inner lobe from each trochanter), or gonapophyses, which form the first valves, whereas the gonocoxites of segment 9 have a pair of gonapophyses (the second valves) plus a pair of gonostyles (the third valves) derived from the distal part of the appendages of segment 9 (and homologous with the styles of the apterygotes mentioned above). In each half of the ovipositor, the second valve slides in a tongue-and-groove fashion against the first valve (Fig. 2.25c), whereas the third valve generally forms a sheath for the other valves.
The external genitalia of male insects include an organ for transferring the spermatozoa (either packaged in a spermatophore or free in fluid) to the female, and often involve structures that grasp and hold the partner during mating. Numerous terms are applied to the various components in different insect groups, and homologies are difficult to establish. Males of Archaeognatha, Zygentoma and Ephemeroptera have relatively simple genitalia, consisting of gonocoxites, gonostyles and sometimes gonapophyses on segment 9 (and also on segment 8 in Archaeognatha), as in the female, except with a median penis (phallus) or, if paired or bilobed, penes, on segment 9 (Fig. 2.26a). The penis (or penes) might be derived

from the fused inner lobes (endites) of either the ancestral coxae or trochanters of segment 9. In the orthopteroid orders, the gonocoxites are reduced or absent, although gonostyles may be present (called styles), and there is a median penis with a lobe called a phallomere on each side of it. The evolutionary fate of the gonapophyses and the origin of the phallomeres are uncertain. In the “higher” insects – the hemipteroids and the holometabolous orders – the homologies and terminology of the male structures are even more confusing if one tries to compare the terminalia of different orders. The whole copulatory organ of higher insects generally is known as the aedeagus (edeagus) and, in addition to insemination, it may clasp and provide sensory stimulation to the female. Typically, there is a median tubular penis (sometimes the term “aedeagus” is restricted to this lobe), which often has an inner tube, the endophallus, which is everted during insemination (see Fig. 5.4b). The ejaculatory duct opens at the gonopore, either at the tip of the penis or the endophallus. Lateral to the penis is a pair of lobes or parameres, which may have a clasping and/or sensory function. Their origin is uncertain; they may be homologous with the gonocoxites and gonostyles of lower insects, with the phallomeres of orthopteroid insects, or may be derived de novo, perhaps even from segment 10. This trilobed type of aedeagus is well exemplified in many beetles (Fig. 2.26b), but modifications are too numerous to describe here.
Much variation in male external genitalia correlates with mating position, which is very variable between and sometimes within orders. Mating positions include end-to-end, side-by-side, male below with his dorsum up, male on top with female dorsum up, and even venter-to-venter. In some insects, torsion of the terminal segments may take place post-metamorphosis or just prior to or during copulation, and asymmetries of male clasping structures occur in many insects. Copulation and associated behaviours are discussed in more detail in Chapter 5.

Muscles and locomotion 57

The dissected open body of an insect is a complex and compact masterpiece of functional design. The “insides” of two omnivorous insects, a cockroach and a cricket, which have relatively unspecialized digestive and reproductive systems are shown in Fig. 3.1. The digestive system, which includes salivary glands as well as an elongate gut, consists of three main sections. These function in storage, biochemical breakdown, absorption and excretion. Each gut section has more than one physiological role and this may be reflected in local structural modifications, such as thickening of the gut wall or diverticula (extensions) from the main lumen. The reproductive systems depicted in Fig. 3.1 exemplify the female and male organs of many insects. These may be dominated in males by very visible accessory glands, especially as the testes of many adult insects are degenerate or absent. This is because the spermatozoa are produced in the pupal or penultimate stage and stored. In gravid female insects, the body cavity may be filled with eggs at various stages of development, thereby obscuring other internal organs. Likewise, the internal structures (except the gut) of a well-fed, late-stage caterpillar may be hidden within the mass of fat body tissue.
The insect body cavity, called the haemocoel (hemocoel) and filled with fluid haemolymph (hemolymph), is lined with endoderm and ectoderm. It is not a true coelom, which is defined as a mesoderm-lined cavity. Haemolymph (so-called because it combines many roles of vertebrate blood (haem/hem and lymph) bathes all internal organs, delivers nutrients, removes metabolites, and performs immune functions. Unlike vertebrate blood, haemolymph rarely has respiratory pigments and therefore has little or no role in gas exchange. In insects, this function is performed by the tracheal system, a ramification of air-filled tubes (tracheae), which sends fine branches throughout the body. Gas entry to, and exit from, tracheae is controlled by sphincter-like structures called spiracles that open through the body wall. Non-gaseous wastes are filtered from the haemolymph by filamentous Malpighian tubules (named after their discoverer), which have free ends distributed through the haemocoel. Their contents are emptied into the gut from which, after

further modification, wastes are eliminated eventually via the anus.
All motor, sensory and physiological processes in insects are controlled by the nervous system in conjunction with hormones (chemical messengers). The brain and ventral nerve cord are readily visible in dissected insects, but most endocrine centres, neurosecretion sites, numerous nerve fibres, muscles and other tissues cannot be seen by the unaided eye.
This chapter describes insect internal structures and their functions. Topics covered are the muscles and locomotion (walking, swimming and flight), the nervous system and co-ordination, endocrine centres and hormones, the haemolymph and its circulation, the tracheal system and gas exchange, the gut and digestion, the fat body, nutrition and microorganisms, the excretory system and waste disposal, and lastly the reproductive organs and gametogenesis. Boxes deal with four special topics, namely neuropeptide research (Box 3.1), tracheal hypertrophy in mealworms at low oxygen concentrations (Box 3.2), the filter chamber of Hemiptera (Box 3.3), and insect cryptonephric systems (Box 3.4). A full account of insect physiology cannot be provided in one chapter. For more comprehensive overviews of specific topics, we direct readers to Chapman (2013) and to relevant chapters in the Encyclopedia of Insects (Resh & Cardé 2009). Most recent advances in insect physiology involve molecular biology; an overview of applications of molecular science to insects can be obtained from a series of volumes edited by Gilbert et al. (2005) and Gilbert (2012), and other sources listed in the Further reading section.
3.1 MUSCLES AND LOCOMOTION
As stated in section 1.3.4, much of the success of insects relates to their ability to sense, interpret and move around their environment. Although the origin of flight, at least 350 million years ago, was a major innovation, terrestrial and aquatic locomotion also is well developed. Power for movement originates from muscles operating against a skeletal system, either the rigid cuticular exoskeleton or, in soft-bodied larvae, a hydrostatic skeleton.

Muscles and locomotion 59

3.1.1 Muscles
Vertebrates and many non-hexapod invertebrates have three kinds of muscles: striated, smooth and cardiac. Insects possess only striated muscles, so-called because of the overlapping thicker myosin and thinner actin filaments that give the appearance of cross-banding under a microscope. Each striated muscle fibre comprises many cells, with a common plasma membrane and sarcolemma, or outer sheath. The sarcolemma is invaginated, but not broken, where an oxygen-supplying tracheole (section 3.5, Fig. 3.10b) contacts the muscle fibre. Contractile myoﬁbrils run the length of the fibre, arranged in sheets or cylinders. When viewed under high magnification, a myofibril can be seen to comprise a thin actin filament sandwiched between a pair of thicker myosin filaments. Muscle contraction involves the sliding of filaments past each other, stimulated by nerve impulses. Innervation comes from one to three motor axons per bundle of fibres, each separately tracheated and referred to as one muscle unit, with several units grouped in a functional muscle.
There are several different muscle types. The most important division is between those that respond synchronously, with one contraction cycle per impulse, and fibrillar muscles that contract asynchronously, with multiple contractions per impulse. Asynchronous muscles include some associated with flight (see below) and the tymbal of cicadas (section 4.1.4).

The basic mode of action does not differ between muscles of insects and vertebrates, although insects can produce prodigious muscular feats for their size, such as the leap of a flea or the repetitive stridulation of the cicada tympanum. Reduced body size benefits insects because of the relationship between: (i) power, which is proportional to muscle cross-section and decreases with reduction in size by the square root; and (ii) the body mass, which decreases with reduction in size by the cube root. Thus, the power : mass ratio increases as body size decreases.
3.1.2 Muscle attachments
The muscles of vertebrates work against an internal skeleton, but the muscles of insects must attach to the inner surface of an external skeleton. As musculature is mesodermal and the exoskeleton is of ectodermal origin, fusion must take place. This occurs by the growth of tonoﬁbrillae, which are fine connecting fibrils that link the epidermal end of the muscle to the epidermal layer (Fig. 3.2a,b). At each moult, tonofibrillae are discarded along with the cuticle, and therefore must be regrown.
At the site of tonofibrillar attachment, the inner cuticle often is strengthened through ridges or apodemes, which, when elongated into arms, are termed apophyses (Fig. 3.2c). These muscle attachment sites, particularly the long, slender apodemes for

individual muscle attachments, often include resilin to give an elasticity that resembles that of vertebrate tendons.
Some insects, including soft-bodied larvae, have mainly thin, flexible cuticle without the rigidity to anchor muscles unless given additional strength. The body contents form a hydrostatic skeleton, with turgidity maintained by criss-crossed body wall “turgor” muscles that continuously contract against the incompressible fluid of the haemocoel, giving a strengthened foundation for other muscles. If the larval body wall is perforated, the fluid leaks, the haemocoel becomes compressible, and the turgor muscles cause the larva to become flaccid.
3.1.3 Crawling, wriggling, swimming and walking
Soft-bodied larvae with hydrostatic skeletons move by crawling. Muscular contraction in one part of the body gives equivalent extension in a relaxed part elsewhere on the body. In apodous (legless) larvae, such as dipteran “maggots”, waves of contractions and relaxation run from head to tail. Bands of adhesive hooks or tubercles successively grip and detach from the substrate to provide a forward motion, aided in some maggots by use of their mouth hooks to grip the substrate. In water, lateral waves of contraction against the hydrostatic skeleton can give a sinuous, snake-like, swimming motion, with anterior-to-posterior waves giving an undulating motion.
Larvae with thoracic legs and abdominal prolegs, like caterpillars, develop posterior-to-anterior waves of turgor muscle contraction, with as many as three waves visible simultaneously. Locomotor muscles operate in cycles of successive detachment of the thoracic legs, reaching forwards and grasping the substrate. These cycles occur in concert with inflation, deflation and forward movement of the posterior prolegs.
Insects with hard exoskeletons can contract and relax pairs of agonistic and antagonistic muscles that attach to the cuticle. Compared to crustaceans and myriapods, insects have fewer legs (six) and these are located more ventrally and closer together on the thorax, allowing concentration of locomotor muscles (both flying and walking) into the thorax, and providing more control and greater efficiency. Motion with six legs at low to moderate speed allows continuous contact with the ground by a tripod of fore

and hind legs on one side and mid leg on the opposite side thrusting rearwards (retraction), whilst each opposite leg is moved forwards (protraction) (Fig. 3.3). The centre of gravity of the slow-moving insect always lies within this tripod, giving great stability. Motion is imparted through thoracic muscles acting on the leg bases, with transmission via internal leg muscles through the leg to extend or flex the leg. Anchorage to the substrate, needed to provide a lever to propel the body, is through pointed claws and adhesive pads (the arolium or, in flies and some beetles, pulvilli). Claws, such as those illustrated in the vignette at the beginning of Chapter 2, can obtain purchase on the slightest roughness in a surface, and the pads of some insects can adhere to perfectly smooth surfaces through the application of lubricants to the tips of numerous fine hairs and by the action of close-range molecular forces between the hairs and the substrate.
When faster motion is required, there are several alternatives: increasing the frequency of the leg movement by shortening the retraction period; increasing the stride length; altering the triangulation basis of support to adopt quadrupedy (use of four legs); or even hind-leg bipedality, with the other legs held above the substrate. At high speeds, even those insects that maintain triangulation are very unstable and may have no legs in contact with the substrate at intervals. This instability at speed seems to cause no difficulty for cockroaches, which when filmed with high-speed video cameras have been shown to maintain speeds of up to 1 m s−1 whilst twisting and turning up to 25 times per second. This motion was maintained by sensory information received from one antenna whose tip maintained contact with an experimentally provided wall, even when it had a zig-zagging surface.
Many insects jump, some prodigiously, usually using modified hind legs. In orthopterans, flea beetles (Chrysomelidae: Alticini) and a range of weevils (Curculionidae), an enlarged hind femur contains large muscles whose slow contraction produces energy that is stored by either distortion of the femoro-tibial joint or in some spring-like sclerotization, for example the hind-leg tibial extension tendon. In fleas, the energy is produced by the trochanter levator muscle raising the femur, and is stored by compression of an elastic resilin pad in the coxa. In all these jumpers, release of tension is sudden, resulting in propulsion of the insect into the air – usually in an uncontrolled manner, although fleas can attain their hosts with some control over the leap. The main benefit for

flighted jumping insects may be to get into the air before opening the wings, so as to avoid damage from the surrounding substrate.
In swimming, contact with the water is maintained during protraction, so the insect must impart more thrust to the rowing motion than to the recovery stroke in order to progress. This is achieved by expanding the effective leg area during retraction by extending fringes of hairs and spines (see Fig. 10.7) that collapse onto the folded leg during the recovery stroke. We have seen already how some insect larvae swim using contractions against their hydrostatic skeleton. Others, including many nymphs and the larvae of caddisflies, can walk underwater and, particularly in running waters, do not swim routinely.
The surface film of water can support some specialist insects, most of which have hydrofuge (water-repelling) cuticles or hair fringes, and some, such as gerrid water-striders (see Fig. 5.7), move by rowing with hair-fringed legs.

3.1.4 Flight
The development of flight allowed insects much greater mobility, which helped in food and mate location and provided much improved powers of dispersal. Importantly, flight opened up many new environments for exploitation. Plant microhabitats such as flowers and foliage are more easily accessed by winged insects than by those without flight.
Fully developed, functional, flying wings occur only in adult insects, although in nymphs the developing wings are visible as wing buds in all but the earliest instars. Usually, two pairs of functional wings arise dorsolaterally, as fore wings on the second and hind wings on the third thoracic segment. Some wing variations are described in section 2.4.2.
To fly, the forces of weight (gravity) and drag (air resistance to movement) must be overcome. In gliding flight, in which the wings are held rigidly outstretched, these forces are overcome through the use of passive air movements – known as the relative wind. The insect attains lift by adjusting the angle of the leading edge of the wing when orientated into the wind. As this angle (the attack angle) increases, so lift increases, until stalling occurs, i.e. when lift is catastrophically lost. In contrast to aircraft, nearly all of which stall at around 20∘, the attack angle of insects can be raised to more than 30∘, even to as high as 50∘, giving great

62 Internal anatomy and physiology

manoeuvrability. Enhanced lift and reduced drag can be attained with wing scales and hairs, which affect the boundary layer across the wing surface.
Most insects can glide, and dragonflies (Odonata) and some grasshoppers (Orthoptera), notably locusts, glide extensively. However, most winged insects fly by beating their wings. Examination of wing beat is difficult because the frequency of even a large, slow-flying butterfly may be five times a second (5 Hz), a bee may beat its wings at 180 Hz, and some midges emit an audible buzz with their wing-beat frequency of greater than 1000 Hz. However, through the use of slowed-down, high-speed cine film, the insect wing beat can be slowed down from faster than the eye can see until a single beat can be analysed. This reveals that a single beat comprises three interlinked movements. The first is a cycle of downward, forward motion followed by an upward and backward motion. Second, during the cycle each wing is rotated around its base. The third component occurs as various parts of the wing flex in response to local variations in air pressure. Unlike gliding, in which the relative wind derives from passive air movement, in true flight the relative wind is produced by the moving wings. The flying insect makes constant adjustments, so that during a wing beat, the air ahead of the insect is thrown backwards and downwards, impelling the insect upwards (lift) and forwards (thrust). In climbing, the emergent air is directed more downwards, reducing thrust but increasing lift. In turning, the wing on the inside of the turn is reduced in power by a decrease in the amplitude of the beat.
Despite the elegance and intricacy of detail of insect flight, the mechanisms responsible for beating the wings are straightforward. The thorax of the wing-bearing segments can be envisaged as a box with the sides (pleura) and base (sternum) rigidly fused, and the wings connected where the rigid tergum is attached to the pleura by flexible membranes. This membranous attachment and the wing hinge are composed of resilin (section 2.1), which gives crucial elasticity to the thoracic box. Flying insects have one of two kinds of arrangements of muscles powering their flight: 1 direct ﬂight muscles connected to the wings, or 2 an indirect system in which there is no muscleto-wing connection, but rather muscle action deforms the thoracic box in order to move the wings.
Some groups such as Odonata and Blattodea appear to use direct flight muscles to varying degrees, although

at least some recovery muscles may be indirect. Others use indirect muscles for flight, with direct muscles providing wing orientation rather than power production.
Direct flight muscles produce the upward stroke by contraction of muscles attached to the wing base inside the pivotal point (Fig. 3.4a). The downward wing stroke is produced through contraction of muscles that extend from the sternum to the wing base outside the pivot point (Fig. 3.4b). In contrast, indirect ﬂight muscles are attached to the tergum and sternum. Contraction causes the tergum, and with it the very base of the wing, to be pulled down. This movement levers the outer, main part of the wing in an upward stroke (Fig. 3.4c). The down beat is powered by contraction of the second set of muscles, which run from front to back of the thorax, thereby deforming the box and lifting the tergum (Fig. 3.4d). At each stage in the cycle, when the flight muscles relax, energy is conserved because the elasticity of the thorax restores its shape.
It seems that primitively the four wings may be controlled independently, with small variations in timing and rate allowing alteration in the direction of flight. However, excessive variation impedes controlled flight and the beat of all wings is usually harmonized, as in butterflies, bugs and bees, for example, by locking the fore and hind wings together, and also by neural control. For insects with slower wing-beat frequencies (< 100 Hz), such as dragonflies, one nerve impulse for each beat can be maintained by synchronous muscles. However, in faster-beating wings, which may attain a frequency of 100 Hz to over 1000 Hz, one impulse per beat is impossible and asynchronous muscles are required. In these insects, the wing is constructed such that only two wing positions are stable – fully up and fully down. As the wing moves from one extreme to the alternate one, it passes through an intermediate, unstable position. As it passes this unstable (“click”) point, thoracic elasticity snaps the wing through to the alternate stable position. Insects with this asynchronous mechanism have peculiar fibrillar flight muscles with the property that on sudden release of muscle tension, as at the click point, the next muscle contraction is induced. Thus, muscles can oscillate, contracting at a much higher frequency than the nerve impulses, which need be only periodic to maintain the insect in flight. Harmonization of the wing beat on each side is maintained through the rigidity of the thorax – as the tergum is depressed or relaxed, what happens to one wing must happen identically to the other. However, insects with indirect

flight muscles retain direct muscles, which are are used in making fine adjustments in wing orientation during flight.
Direction and any deviations from the flight course, perhaps caused by air movements, are sensed predominantly through an insect’s eyes and antennae. However, the true flies (Diptera) have extremely sophisticated sensory equipment, with their hind wings modified as balancing organs. These halteres, which each comprise a base, stem and apical knob (see Fig. 2.24f), beat in time but out of phase with the fore wings. The knob, which is heavier than the rest of the organ, tends to keep the halteres beating in one plane. When the fly alters direction, whether voluntarily or otherwise, the haltere is twisted. The stem, which is richly endowed with sensilla, detects this movement, and the fly can respond accordingly.
Initiation of flight, for whatever reason, may involve the legs springing the insect into the air. Loss of tarsal

contact with the ground causes neural firing of the direct flight muscles. In flies, flight activity originates in contraction of a mid-leg muscle, which both propels the leg downwards (and the fly upwards) and simultaneously pulls the tergum downwards to inaugurate flight. The legs are also important when landing because there is no gradual braking by running forwards – all the shock is taken on the outstretched legs, endowed with pads, spines and claws for adhesion.
3.2 THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND CO-ORDINATION
The complex nervous system of insects integrates a diverse array of external sensory and internal physiological information and generates some of the behaviours discussed in Chapter 4. In common with other animals, the basic component is the nerve cell,

64 Internal anatomy and physiology

or neuron (neurone), composed of a cell body with two projections (fibres): the dendrite, which receives stimuli; and the axon, which transmits information, either to another neuron or to an effector organ such as a muscle. Insect neurons release a variety of chemicals at synapses to either stimulate or inhibit effector neurons or muscles. Important neurotransmitters include acetylcholine and catecholamines such as dopamine, as in vertebrates. More insect-specific neuromuscular transmitters are L-glutamate (stimulatory) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (inhibition), with muscle activity being modulated by neurochemicals including octopamine, serotonin and proctolin.
Neurons (Fig. 3.5) are of at least four types: 1 sensory neurons receive stimuli from the insect’s environment and transmit them to the central nervous system (see below); 2 interneurons (or association neurons) receive information from and transmit it to other neurons; 3 motor neurons receive information from interneurons and transmit it to muscles; 4 neurosecretory cells (neuroendocrine cells), as in section 3.3.1.
The cell bodies of interneurons and motor neurons are aggregated, with the fibres interconnecting all types of nerve cells to form nerve centres called ganglia. Simple reflex behaviour has been well studied in insects (described further in section 4.5), but insect

behaviour can be complex, involving integration of neural information within the ganglia.
The central nervous system (CNS) (Fig. 3.6) is the principal division of the nervous system, and consists of series of ganglia joined by paired longitudinal nerve cords called connectives. Ancestrally, there was a pair of ganglia per body segment, but usually the two ganglia of each thoracic and abdominal segment are now fused into a single structure and the ganglia of all head segments are coalesced to form two ganglionic centres – the brain and the suboesophageal (subesophageal) ganglion (seen in Fig. 3.7). The chain of thoracic and abdominal ganglia found on the floor of the body cavity is called the ventral nerve cord. The brain, or the dorsal ganglionic centre of the head, is composed of three pairs of fused ganglia (from the first three head segments): 1 the protocerebrum, associated with the eyes and thus bearing the optic lobes; 2 the deutocerebrum, innervating the antennae; 3 the tritocerebrum, concerned with handling the signals that arrive from the body.
Coalesced ganglia of the three mouthpart-bearing segments (mandibular, maxillary and labial) form the suboesophageal ganglion, with nerves emerging that innervate the mouthparts.
The visceral (or sympathetic) nervous system consists of three subsystems: the stomodeal (or stomatogastric) nervous system (which includes the frontal

ganglion); the ventral visceral nervous system; and the caudal visceral nervous system. Together, the nerves and ganglia of these subsystems innervate the anterior and posterior gut, several endocrine organs (corpora cardiaca and corpora allata), the reproductive organs, and the tracheal system including the spiracles.
The peripheral nervous system consists of all of the motor neuron axons that radiate to the muscles from the ganglia of the CNS and stomodeal nervous system plus the sensory neurons of the cuticular sensory structures (the sense organs) that receive mechanical, chemical, thermal or visual stimuli from an insect’s environment. Insect sensory systems are discussed in detail in Chapter 4.

tissues, haemolymph transfusion, hormone extraction and purification, and radioactive labelling of hormone extracts. Today, molecular biological (Box 3.1) and advanced chemical analytical techniques allow hormone isolation, characterization and manipulation.
3.3.1 Endocrine centres
Insect hormones are produced by neuronal, neuroglandular or glandular centres (Fig. 3.8). Hormonal production by some organs, such as the ovaries, is secondary to their main function, but several tissues and organs are specialized for an endocrine role.

3.3 THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM AND THE FUNCTION OF HORMONES
Hormones are chemicals produced within an organism’s body and transported, generally in body fluids, away from their point of synthesis to sites where they influence many physiological processes, despite being present in extremely small quantities. Insect hormones have been studied in detail in few species, but similar patterns of production and function are likely to apply widely. The actions and interrelationships of these chemical messengers are varied and complex, but the role of hormones in the moulting process is of overwhelming importance and will be discussed more fully in this context in section 6.3. Here, we provide an overview of the endocrine centres and the hormones that they export.
Historically, the implication of hormones in the processes of moulting and metamorphosis resulted from simple but elegant experiments. These utilized techniques that removed the influence of the brain (decapitation), isolated the haemolymph of different parts of the body (ligation), or artificially connected the haemolymph of two or more insects by joining their bodies. Ligation and decapitation of insects enabled researchers to localize the sites of control of developmental and reproductive processes, and to show that substances are released that affect tissues at sites distant from the point of release. In addition, critical developmental periods for the action of these controlling substances have been identified. The blood-sucking bug Rhodnius prolixus (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) and various moths and flies were the principal experimental insects. More-refined technologies allowed microsurgical removal or transplant of various

Box 3.1 Molecular genetic techniques and their application to neuropeptide research
Molecular biology is essentially a technical “toolbox” for the isolation, analysis and manipulation of DNA and its RNA and protein products. Molecular genetics is concerned primarily with the nucleic acids, whereas research on the proteins and their constituent amino acids involves chemistry. Thus, genetics and chemistry are integral to molecular biology. Molecular biological tools include: • a means of cutting DNA at specific sites using restriction enzymes, and of rejoining naked ends of cut fragments using ligase enzymes; • techniques that produce numerous identical copies by repeated cycles of amplification of a segment of DNA (e.g. polymerase chain reaction, PCR); • methods for rapid sequencing of nucleotides of DNA or RNA, and amino acids of proteins; • the ability to synthesize specific sequences of DNA, RNA or proteins; • the ability to search a genome for a specific nucleotide sequence using probes of nucleic acid segments complementary to the sequence being sought; • site-directed mutation of specific DNA segments in vitro; • genetic engineering – the isolation and transfer of intact genes into other organisms, with subsequent stable transmission and gene expression; • cytochemical techniques to observe gene transcription; • immunochemical and histochemical techniques to identify how, when and where a specific gene product functions; • relatively rapid and inexpensive sequencing and assembly of the complete genome, the totality of DNA in an organism (genomics); • the ability to silence (knockdown) genes of interest in vivo by “reverse genetics” using RNA interference (RNAi); • the ability to induce overexpression or ecotopic expression in vivo of specific genes.
Insect peptide hormones used to be difficult to study because of the minute quantities produced by individual insects and their structural complexity and occasional instability. The realization that these proteins play crucial roles in insect physiology (see Table 3.1), and the recent availability of some of the techniques listed above, have led to an explosion of studies of neuropeptide signalling systems. Nevertheless, although neuropeptide amino acid sequences provide an entry to the powerful capabilities of molecular genetics, there remain many “orphaned” neuropeptide systems in which functions and receptors remain unknown. This applies even in the very well-studied Drosophila genome. Although signalling systems seem to be highly conserved through evolutionary time, presumably due to their centrality to insect physiology, some neuropeptides and receptors appear to have been lost even at an ordinal level. With increasing availability of whole genomes across a greater diversity of insects, and the use of reverse genetics to “silence” genes, there is scope for wider understanding of these pervasive signalling chemicals. Not least is the future potential for neuropeptide research in control of insect pests, discussed in section 16.4.3.

the nervous system (within the CNS, peripheral nervous system and stomodeal nervous system), but they occur in major groups in the brain. These cells produce most of the known insect hormones, the notable exceptions being the production by non-neural tissues of ecdysteroids and juvenile hormones. However, the synthesis and release of the latter hormones are regulated by neurohormones from NSC.

side of the aorta and behind the brain. As well as producing their own neurohormones (such as adipokinetic hormone, AKH), they store and release neurohormones, including prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH, formerly called brain hormone or ecdysiotropin), originating from the NSC of the brain. PTTH stimulates the secretory activity of the prothoracic glands.

head. In cyclorrhaphous Diptera they are part of the ring gland, which also contains the corpora cardiaca and corpora allata. The prothoracic glands secrete an ecdysteroid, usually ecdysone (sometimes called moulting hormone), which, after hydroxylation, elicits the moulting process of the epidermis (section 6.3). In most insects, the prothoracic glands degenerate in the adult, but they are retained in bristletails (Archaeognatha) and silverfish (Zygentoma), which continue to moult as adults.
Corpora allata
The corpora allata (singular: corpus allatum) are small, discrete, paired glandular bodies derived from the epithelium and located on either side of the foregut. In some insects they fuse to form a single gland. Their function is to secrete juvenile hormone (JH), which has regulatory roles in both metamorphosis and reproduction. In Lepidoptera, the corpora allata also store and release PTTH.
Inka cells
These endocrine cells are a major component of the epitracheal glands, which are paired structures attached to tracheal trunks near each spiracle, and are found in the prothoracic and abdominal segments of Lepidoptera, Diptera, and some Coleoptera and Hymenoptera. In other Holometabola, including most beetles and bees, and all hemimetabolous insects thus far examined, numerous small Inka cells are dispersed throughout the tracheal system. Inka cells produce and release pre-ecdysis and ecdysis triggering hormones (PETH and ETH), which are peptides that activate the ecdysis sequence by acting on receptors in the CNS. The ecdysis sequence consists of pre-ecdysis, ecdysis and post-ecdysis behaviours, and involves specific contractions of skeletal muscles, which lead to movements that facilitate the splitting and shedding of the old cuticle.
3.3.2 Hormones
Three hormones or hormone types are integral to growth and reproductive functions in insects. These are the ecdysteroids, the juvenile hormones and the neurohormones (also called neuropeptides).

Ecdysteroid is a general term applied to any steroid with moult-promoting activity. All ecdysteroids are derived from sterols, such as cholesterol, which insects cannot synthesize de novo and must obtain from their diet. Ecdysteroids occur in all insects and form a large group of compounds, of which ecdysone and 20-hydroxyecdysone are the most common members. Ecdysone (also called a-ecdysone) is released from the prothoracic glands into the haemolymph and usually is converted to the more active hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone in several peripheral tissues, especially the fat body. The 20-hydroxyecdysone (referred to as ecdysterone or b-ecdysone in older literature) is the most widespread and physiologically important ecdysteroid in insects. The action of ecdysteroids in eliciting moulting is well studied, and functions similarly in different insects. Ecdysteroids are produced also by the ovary of the adult female insect and may be involved in ovarian maturation (e.g. yolk deposition) or be packaged in the eggs to be metabolized during the formation of embryonic cuticle.
Juvenile hormones form a family of related sesquiterpenoid compounds, so that the symbol JH may denote one or a mixture of hormones, including JH-I, JH-II, JH-III and JH-0. The occurrence of mixed-JH-producing insects (such as the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta) adds to the complexity of unravelling the functions of the homologous JHs. These hormones are signalling molecules, and act via lipid activation of proteins that play a diversity of roles in development and physiology. Lipid-based signalling systems are known to have diverse modes of action and generally do not require high-affinity binding to receptor sites. Insect JHs have two major roles – the control of metamorphosis and the regulation of reproductive development. Larval characteristics are maintained and metamorphosis is inhibited by JH; adult development requires a moult in the absence of JH (see section 6.3 for details). Thus, JH controls the degree and direction of differentiation at each moult. In the adult female insect, JH stimulates the deposition of yolk in the eggs and affects accessory gland activity and pheromone production (section 5.11).
Neurohormones, the largest class of insect hormones, are peptides (small proteins) with the alternative name of neuropeptides. These protein messengers are the master regulators of all insect physiological processes, including development, homeostasis, metabolism and reproduction, as well as the secretion of the JHs and ecdysteroids. Over a hundred

The circulatory system 69

neuropeptides have been recognized, many existing in multiple forms encoded by the same gene but resulting from gene duplication, mutation and selection giving rise to closely related signalling systems. Some important physiological processes controlled by neurohormones in some or all insects are summarized in Table 3.1. The diversity and vital co-ordinating roles of these small molecules are characterized increasingly via peptide molecular biology (Box 3.1) combined with the availability of the complete Drosophila genome. Neuropeptides regulate by both inhibitory and stimulatory signals, and reach action sites (receptors) via nerve axons or the haemolymph. Others control indirectly via their action on other endocrine glands (corpora allata and prothoracic glands). Receptors are high-affinity binding sites located in the plasma membrane of the target cells, with most classified as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Exceptions include prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) and insulin-like peptides that activate by binding to a receptor tyrosine kinase. Some ligand-receptor pairs are very specific in responding to a single neuropeptide type, whereas other receptors respond to several types of ligand.
3.4 THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Haemolymph, the insect body fluid (with properties and functions as described in section 3.4.1), circulates freely around the internal organs. The pattern of flow is regular between compartments and appendages, assisted by muscular contractions of parts of the body, especially the peristaltic contractions of a longitudinal dorsal vessel, part of which is sometimes called the heart. Haemolymph does not directly contact the cells because the internal organs and the epidermis are covered in a basement membrane, which may regulate the exchange of materials. This open circulatory system has only a few vessels and compartments to direct haemolymph movement, in contrast to the closed network of blood-conducting vessels seen in vertebrates.
3.4.1 Haemolymph
The volume of the haemolymph may be substantial (20–40% of body weight) in soft-bodied larvae, which use the body fluid as a hydrostatic skeleton, but is less than 20% of body weight in most nymphs and

adults. Haemolymph is a watery fluid containing ions, molecules and cells. It is often clear and colourless, but may be variously pigmented yellow, green or blue, or rarely, in the immature stages of a few aquatic and endoparasitic flies, red owing to the presence of haemoglobin. All chemical exchanges between insect tissues are mediated via the haemolymph – hormones are transported, nutrients are distributed from the gut, and wastes are removed to the excretory organs. However, insect haemolymph rarely contains respiratory pigments and hence has a very low oxygen-carrying capacity. Local changes in haemolymph pressure are important in ventilation of the tracheal system (section 3.5.1), in thermoregulation (section 4.2.2), and at moulting to aid splitting of the old and expansion of the new cuticle. The haemolymph serves also as a water reserve, as its main constituent, plasma, is an aqueous solution of inorganic ions, lipids, sugars (mainly trehalose), amino acids, proteins, organic acids and other compounds. High concentrations of amino acids and organic phosphates characterize insect haemolymph, which also is the site of deposition of molecules associated with cold protection (section 6.6.1). Haemolymph proteins include those that act in storage (hexamerins) and those that transport lipids (lipophorin) or complex with iron (ferritin) or juvenile hormone (JH-binding protein). Hexamerins are large proteins that are synthesized in the fat body and occur in the haemolymph at very high concentrations in many insects, and are believed to act as a source of energy and amino acids during non-feeding periods, such as pupation. However, their functions appear to be much more diverse as, at least in some insects, they may have roles in sclerotization of insect cuticle and in immune responses, serve as carriers for juvenile hormone and ecdysteroids, and also be involved in caste formation in termites via JH regulation. Hexamerins evolved from copper-containing haemocyanins (that function as respiratory pigments in many arthropods) and some insects, such as stoneflies (Plecoptera), have haemocyanins that function to transport oxygen in the haemolymph. In stoneflies, this pigment-based oxygen transport system occurs in conjunction with a tracheal system that takes oxygen directly to the tissues. Haemocyanins probably were the ancestral method for oxygen transport in insects (section 8.3), but subsquently were widely lost.
The blood cells, or haemocytes (hemocytes), are of several types (mainly plasmatocytes, granulocytes,

prohaemocytes and oenocytoids) and all are nucleate. They have four basic functions: 1 phagocytosis – the ingestion of small particles and substances such as metabolites; 2 encapsulation of parasites and other large foreign materials; 3 haemolymph coagulation; 4 storage and distribution of nutrients.
The haemocoel contains two additional types of cells. Nephrocytes (sometimes called pericardial cells) generally occur on or near the dorsal vessel and regulate haemolymph composition by sieving/filtering certain substances and metabolizing them for use or excretion elsewhere. Oenocytes are of epidermal origin but may occur in the haemocoel, fat body or epidermis. Although their functions are unclear in most insects, they have many roles and are involved in lipid metabolism, including cuticle lipid (hydrocarbon) synthesis, as well as detoxification and developmental signalling in some insects and, in some chironomids, they produce haemoglobins.
3.4.2 Circulation
Circulation in insects is maintained mostly by a system of muscular pumps moving haemolymph through compartments separated by fibromuscular septa or membranes. The main pump is the pulsatile dorsal vessel. The anterior part may be called the aorta and the posterior part may be called the heart, but the two terms are inconsistently applied. The dorsal vessel is a simple tube, generally composed of one layer of myocardial cells and with segmentally arranged openings, or ostia. The lateral ostia typically permit the one-way flow of haemolymph into the dorsal vessel as a result of valves that prevent backflow. In many insects there also are more ventral ostia that permit haemolymph to flow out of the dorsal vessel, probably to supply adjacent active muscles. There may be up to three pairs of thoracic ostia and nine pairs of abdominal ostia, although there is an evolutionary tendency towards reduction in the number of ostia. The dorsal vessel lies in a compartment, the pericardial sinus, above a dorsal diaphragm (a fibromuscular septum – a separating membrane) formed of connective tissue and segmental pairs of alary muscles. The alary muscles support the dorsal vessel but their contractions do not affect heartbeat. Haemolymph enters the pericardial sinus via segmental openings in the diaphragm and/or

at the posterior border, and then moves into the dorsal vessel via the ostia during a muscular relaxation phase. Waves of contraction, which normally start at the posterior end of the body, pump the haemolymph forwards in the dorsal vessel and out via the aorta into the head. Next, the appendages of the head and thorax are supplied with haemolymph as it circulates posteroventrally and eventually returns to the pericardial sinus and the dorsal vessel. A generalized pattern of haemolymph circulation in the body is shown in Fig. 3.9a; however, in adult insects there also may be a periodic reversal of haemolymph flow in the dorsal vessel (from thorax posteriorly) as part of normal circulatory regulation.
Another important component of the circulation of many insects is the ventral diaphragm (Fig. 3.9b) – a fibromuscular septum that lies in the floor of the body cavity and is associated with the ventral nerve cord. Circulation of the haemolymph is aided by active peristaltic contractions of the ventral diaphragm, which direct the haemolymph backwards and laterally in the perineural sinus below the diaphragm. Haemolymph flow from the thorax to the abdomen also may be dependent, at least partially, on expansion of the abdomen, thus “sucking” haemolymph posteriorly. Haemolymph movements are especially important in insects that use the circulation in thermoregulation (e.g. some Odonata, Diptera, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera). The diaphragm may facilitate rapid exchange of chemicals between the ventral nerve cord and the haemolymph, either by actively moving the haemolymph and/or moving the cord itself.
Haemolymph generally is circulated to appendages unidirectionally by various tubes, septa, valves and pumps (Fig. 3.9c). The muscular pumps are termed accessory pulsatile organs and occur at the antennal and wing bases, and sometimes in the legs. Furthermore, the antennal pulsatile organs may release neurohormones that are carried to the antennal lumen to influence the sensory neurons. Wings have a circulation, although apparent often only in the young adult. At least in some Lepidoptera, circulation in the wing occurs by the reciprocal movement of haemolymph (in the wing vein sinuses) and air (within the elastic wing tracheae) into and from the wing, brought about by pulsatile organ activity, reversals of heartbeat, and tracheal volume changes.

vessel, fibromuscular diaphragms and accessory pumps, mediated by both nervous and neurohormonal regulation. The physiological regulation of many body functions by the neurosecretory system occurs via neurohormones transported in the haemolymph.
3.4.3 Protection and defence by the haemolymph
Haemolymph provides various kinds of protection and defence from: (i) physical injury; (ii) the entry of disease organisms, parasites or other foreign substances; and sometimes (iii) the actions of predators.

In some insects, the haemolymph contains malodorous or distasteful chemicals, which are deterrent to predators (Chapter 14). Injury to the integument elicits a wound-healing process that involves haemocytes and plasma coagulation. A haemolymph clot seals the wound and reduces further haemolymph loss and bacterial entry. If disease organisms or particles enter an insect’s body, then immune responses are invoked. These include the cellular defence mechanisms of phagocytosis, encapsulation and nodule formation mediated by the haemocytes, as well as the actions of humoral factors such as enzymes or other proteins (e.g. lysozymes, prophenoloxidase, lectins and peptides).

The tracheal system and gas exchange 73

The immune system of insects bears little resemblance to the complex immunoglobulin-based vertebrate system, yet insects infected sublethally with bacteria can acquire resistance against subsequent infection. Haemocytes are involved in phagocytosing bacteria but, in addition, immunity proteins with antibacterial activity appear in the haemolymph after a primary infection. For example, lytic peptides called cecropins, which disrupt the cell membranes of bacteria and other pathogens, have been isolated from certain moths. Furthermore, some neuropeptides may participate in cell-mediated immune responses by exchanging signals between the neuroendocrine system and the immune system, as well as influencing the behaviour of cells involved in immune reactions.
The enzyme phenoloxidase (PO) plays a central role in insect immunochemistry. It is produced as an inactive zymogen (proPO), mostly in haematocytes (oenocytoids). PO produces indoles, which are polymerized to melanin (used in encapsulation of foreign material), and the enzymatic reactions involved produce quinones, diphenols, superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and reactive nitrogen intermediates. These help defend against bacteria, fungi and viruses. Activation and inhibition of phenoloxidase involves zymogens (enzyme precursors), inhibitor enzymes, and signalling molecules in a diversity of cell types. Phenoloxidase-based immunity is metabolically expensive and has fitness costs.
The insect immune response to ingestion of pathogens is located in the alimentary system, especially the mid-gut, where two responses are induced: reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are produced. Management of ROS is needed to protect the gut from self-harm from peroxide and hypochlorous acids. Likewise, AMPs have to be regulated to safeguard beneficial resident microbiota, while responding rapidly and effectively against pathogenic intruders.
3.5 THE TRACHEAL SYSTEM AND GAS EXCHANGE
In common with all aerobic animals, insects must obtain oxygen from their environment and eliminate carbon dioxide respired by their cells. This gas exchange must be distinguished from respiration, which refers strictly to oxygen-consuming, cellular metabolic processes. Gas exchange occurs largely

through internal air-filled tracheae – tubes that branch and ramify throughout the body (Fig. 3.10). The finest branches contact all internal organs and tissues, and are especially numerous in tissues with high oxygen requirements. Air usually enters the tracheae via spiracles, which are muscle-controlled openings positioned laterally on the body, primitively with one pair per post-cephalic segment (but not now on the prothorax or posterior abdomen). No extant insect has more than 10 pairs (two thoracic and eight abdominal) (Fig. 3.11a), most have eight or nine, and some have one (Fig. 3.11c), two or none (Fig. 3.11d–f). Typically, spiracles (Fig. 3.10a) have a chamber, or atrium, with an opening-and-closing mechanism, or valve, either projecting externally or at the inner end of the atrium. In the latter type, a filter apparatus sometimes protects the outer opening. Each spiracle may be set in a sclerotized cuticular plate called a peritreme.
The tracheae are invaginations of the epidermis and thus their lining is continuous with the body cuticle. The characteristic ringed appearance of the tracheae seen in tissue sections (as in Fig. 3.7) is due to the spiral ridges or thickenings of the cuticular lining, the taenidia, which allow the tracheae to be flexible but to resist compression (analogous to the function of the ringed hose of a vacuum cleaner). The cuticular linings of the tracheae are shed with the rest of the exoskeleton when the insect moults. Usually, even the linings of the finest branches of the tracheal system are shed at ecdysis, but linings of the fluid-filled blind endings, the tracheoles, may or may not be shed. Tracheoles are less than 1 μm in diameter and closely contact the respiring tissues (Fig. 3.10b), sometimes indenting into the cells that they supply. However, the tracheae that supply oxygen to the ovaries of many insects have very few tracheoles, the taenidia are weak or absent, and the tracheal surface is evaginated as tubular spirals projecting into the haemolymph. These aptly named aeriferous tracheae have a highly permeable surface that allows direct aeration of the surrounding haemolymph from tracheae that may exceed 50 μm in diameter.
In terrestrial and many aquatic insects, the tracheae open to the exterior via the spiracles (an open tracheal system) (Fig. 3.11a–c). In contrast, in some aquatic and many endoparasitic larvae, spiracles are absent (a closed tracheal system) and the tracheae divide peripherally to form a network. This covers the general body surface (allowing cutaneous

gas exchange) (Fig. 3.11d) or lies within specialized filaments or lamellae (tracheal gills) (Fig. 3.11e,f). Some aquatic insects with an open tracheal system carry gas gills with them (e.g. bubbles of air); these may be temporary or permanent (section 10.3.4).

The volume of the tracheal system ranges between 5% and 50% of the body volume, depending on species and stage of development. The more active the insect, the more extensive is the tracheal system. The tracheal system can expand during an insect’s

growth in response to oxygen needs of all or part of the insect (Box 3.2). For example, in Drosophila larvae, tracheal cells are extremely sensitive to oxygen levels, and modulate the expression of hypoxia-induced proteins, which leads to new trachea being grown in the direction of the oxygen-deprived tissue. Also, the larger the insect, the greater the fraction of the body

devoted to tracheal volume. Parts of tracheae may be dilated or enlarged to increase the reservoir of air, and the dilations may form air sacs (Fig. 3.11b), which are collapsible as the taenidia of the cuticular lining are reduced or absent. Sometimes the tracheal volume may decrease within a developmental stage, as air sacs are occluded by growing tissues. Air sacs reach their

Box 3.2 Tracheal hypertrophy in mealworms at low oxygen concentrations
Resistance to diffusion of gases in insect tracheal systems arises from the spiracular valves, when they are partially or fully closed, the tracheae, and the cytoplasm supplied by the tracheoles at the end of the tracheae. Air-filled tracheae will have a much lower resistance per unit length than the watery cytoplasm because oxygen diffuses several orders of magnitude faster in air than it does in cytoplasm for the same gradient of oxygen partial pressure. Until recently, the tracheal system was believed to provide more than sufficient oxygen (at least in non-flying insects that lack air sacs), with the tracheae offering trivial resistance to the passage of oxygen. Experiments on mealworm larvae, Tenebrio molitor (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), that were reared in different levels of oxygen (all at the same total gas pressure) showed that the main tracheae that supply oxygen to the tissues in the larvae hypertrophy (increase in size) at lower oxygen levels. The dorsal (D), ventral (V) and visceral (or gut, G) tracheae were affected, but not the lateral longitudinal tracheae that interconnect the spiracles (the four tracheal categories are illustrated in an inset on the graph). The dorsal tracheae supply the dorsal vessel and dorsal musculature, the ventral tracheae supply the nerve cord and ventral musculature, whereas the visceral tracheae supply the gut, fat body and gonads. The graph shows that the cross-sectional areas of the tracheae were greater when the larvae were reared in 10.5% oxygen than when they were reared in 21% oxygen (as in normal air) (After Loudon 1989). Each point on the graph is for a single larva and is the average of the summed areas of the dorsal, ventral and visceral tracheae for six pairs of abdominal spiracles. This hypertrophy appears to be inconsistent with the widely accepted hypothesis that tracheae contribute an insignificant resistance to net oxygen movement in insect tracheal systems. Alternatively, hypertrophy may simply increase the amount of air (and thus oxygen) that can be stored in the tracheal system, rather than reduce resistance to air flow. This might be particularly important for mealworms because they normally live in a dry environment and may minimize the opening of their spiracles. Whatever the explanation, the observations suggest that some adjustment can be made to the size of the tracheae in mealworms (and perhaps other insects) to match the requirements of the respiring tissues.

greatest development in very active flying insects, such as bees and cyclorrhaphous Diptera. They may assist flight by increasing buoyancy, but their main function is in ventilation of the tracheal system.
3.5.1 Diffusion and ventilation
Oxygen enters the spiracle, passes through the length of the tracheae to the tracheoles and into the target cells, by a combination of ventilation and diffusion along a concentration gradient, from high in the external air to low in the tissue. Net movement of oxygen molecules in the tracheae is inward, but for carbon dioxide and (in terrestrial insects) water vapour molecules it is outward. Hence, gas exchange in most terrestrial insects is a compromise between securing sufficient oxygen and reducing water loss via the spiracles. Some insect species exchange gases continuously (the spiracles always open), others cyclically, and yet others discontinuously. During periods of inactivity, the spiracles in many adult and diapausing pupal insects are mostly shut, opening only periodically, so that gases are exchanged discontinuously in a three-phase cycle referred to as discontinuous gas exchange. When the spiracles are closed, cellular respiration in the body causes oxygen to be used up, and the partial pressure of oxygen within the tracheal system drops until a certain threshold level at which the spiracles rapidly open and close at high frequency (the flutter phase). Some atmospheric oxygen enters the tracheae during the flutter phase, but carbon dioxide continues to build up until eventually it triggers an open spiracular phase, during which tracheal oxygen, carbon dioxide and water are exchanged with the outside air, either by diffusion or active ventilation. Comparative study of many insects living in different environments suggests that discontinuous gas exchange evolved to reduce tracheal water loss, although this may not be the only explanation, as some insects in dry areas exchange gases continuously. In insects of xeric environments, the spiracles may be small with deep atria or have a mesh of cuticular projections in the orifice. Insects in low-oxygen environments, such as underground nests, may use discontinuous gas exchange as a method for increasing tracheal concentration gradients to facilitate uptake of oxygen and emission of carbon dioxide.
In insects without air sacs, such as most holometabolous larvae, diffusion appears to be the primary mechanism for the movement of gases in the tracheae,

and is always the sole mode of gas exchange at the tissues. The efficiency of diffusion is related to the distance of diffusion and probably to the diameter of the tracheae (Box 3.2). Rapid cycles of tracheal compression and expansion have been observed in the head and thorax of some insects using X-ray videoing. Movements of the haemolymph and body could not explain these cycles, which appear to be a distinct mechanism of gas exchange in insects. In addition, large or dilated tracheae may serve as an oxygen reserve when the spiracles are closed. In very active insects, especially large ones, active pumping movements of the thorax and/or abdomen ventilate (pump air through) the outer parts of the tracheal system, and thus the diffusion pathway to the tissues is reduced. Rhythmic thoracic movements and/or dorsoventral flattening or telescoping of the abdomen expels air, via the spiracles, from extensible or some partially compressible tracheae, or from air sacs. Co-ordinated opening and closing of the spiracles usually accompanies ventilatory movements and provides the basis for the unidirectional airflow that occurs in the main tracheae of larger insects. Anterior spiracles open during inspiration and posterior ones open during expiration. The presence of air sacs, especially if large or extensive, facilitates ventilation by increasing the volume of tidal air that can be changed as a result of ventilatory movements. If the main tracheal branches are strongly ventilated, diffusion appears sufficient to oxygenate even the most actively respiring tissues, such as flight muscles. However, the design of the gas-exchange system of insects places an upper limit on size because if oxygen has to diffuse over a considerable distance, the requirements of a very large and active insect either could not be met, even with ventilatory movements and compression and expansion of tracheae, or would result in substantial loss of water through the spiracles. Interestingly, many large insects are long and thin, thereby minimizing the diffusion distance from the spiracle along the trachea to any internal organ.
3.6 THE GUT, DIGESTION AND NUTRITION
Insects of different groups consume an astonishing variety of foods, including watery xylem sap (e.g. nymphs of spittle bugs and cicadas), vertebrate blood (e.g. bed bugs and female mosquitoes), dry wood (e.g. some termites), bacteria and algae (e.g. black fly and

many caddisfly larvae), and the internal tissues of other insects (e.g. endoparasitic wasp larvae). The diverse range of mouthpart types (section 2.3.1) correlates with the diets of different insects, but gut structure and function also reflect the mechanical properties and the nutrient composition of the food eaten. Four major feeding specializations can be identified, depending on whether the food is solid or liquid, or of plant or animal origin (Fig. 3.12). Some insect species clearly fall into a single category, but others with generalized diets may fall between two or more of them, and most holometabolous insects will occupy different categories at different stages of their life (e.g. moths and butterflies switch from solid-plant as larvae to liquid-plant as adults). Gut morphology and physiology relate to these

dietary differences in the following ways. Insects that take solid food typically have a wide, straight, short gut with strong musculature and obvious protection from abrasion (especially in the midgut, which has no cuticular lining). These features are most obvious in solid-feeders with rapid throughput of food, as in plant-feeding caterpillars. In contrast, insects feeding on blood, sap or nectar usually have long, narrow, convoluted guts to allow maximal contact with the liquid food; here, protection from abrasion is unnecessary. The most obvious gut specialization of liquid-feeders is a mechanism for removing excess water to concentrate nutrient substances prior to digestion, as seen in hemipterans (Box 3.3). From a nutritional viewpoint, most plant-feeding insects need

Fig. 3.12 The four major categories of insect-feeding specialization. Many insects are typical of one category, but others cross two categories (or more, as in generalist cockroaches). (After Dow 1986.)

Box 3.3 The ﬁlter chamber of Hemiptera
Most Hemiptera have an unusual arrangement of the midgut that is related to their habit of feeding on plant fluids. An anterior and a posterior part of the gut (typically involving the midgut) are in intimate contact to allow concentration of the liquid food. This ﬁlter chamber allows excess water and relatively small molecules, such as simple sugars, to be passed quickly and directly from the anterior gut to the hindgut, thereby short-circuiting the main absorptive portion of the midgut. Thus, the digestive region is not diluted by water nor congested by superabundant food

molecules. Well-developed filter chambers are characteristic of cicadas and spittle bugs, which feed on xylem (sap that is rich in ions, low in organic compounds, and with low osmotic pressure), and leafhoppers and coccoids, which feed on phloem (sap that is rich in nutrients, especially sugars, and with high osmotic pressure). The gut physiology of such sap suckers has been rather poorly studied because accurate recording of gut fluid composition and osmotic pressure depends on the technically difficult task of taking readings from an intact gut.
Adult female coccoids of gall-inducing Apiomorpha species (Eriococcidae) (section 11.2.5) tap the vascular tissue of the gall wall to obtain phloem sap. Some species have a highly developed filter chamber formed from loops of the anterior midgut and anterior hindgut enclosed within the membranous rectum. Depicted here is the gut of an adult female of A. munita viewed from the ventral side of the body. The thread-like sucking mouthparts (see Fig. 11.4c) in series with the cibarial pump connect to a short oesophagus, which can be seen here in both the main drawing and the enlarged lateral view of the filter chamber. The oesophagus terminates at the anterior midgut, which coils upon itself as three loops of the filter chamber. It emerges ventrally and forms a large midgut loop lying free in the haemolymph. Absorption of nutrients occurs in this free loop. The Malpighian tubules enter the gut at the beginning of the ileum, before the ileum enters the filter chamber where it is closely apposed to the much narrower anterior midgut. Within the irregular spiral of the filter chamber, the fluids in the two tubes move in opposite directions (as indicated by the arrows).
The filter chamber of these coccoids apparently transports sugar (perhaps by active pumps) and water (passively) from the anterior midgut to the ileum and then via the narrow colo-rectum to the rectum, from which it is eliminated as honeydew. In A. munita, other than water, the honeydew is mostly sugar (accounting for 80% of the total osmotic pressure of about 550 mOsm kg−1*). Remarkably, the osmotic pressure of the haemolymph (about 300 mOsm kg−1) is much lower than that within the filter chamber (about 450 mOsm kg−1) and rectum. Maintenance of this large osmotic difference may be facilitated by the impermeability of the rectal wall.
*Osmolarity values are from unpublished data of P.D. Cooper and A.T. Marshall.

to process large amounts of food because nutrient levels in leaves and stems are often low. The gut is usually short and without storage areas, as food is available continuously. By comparison, a diet of animal tissue is nutrient-rich and, at least for predators, well balanced. However, the food may be available only intermittently (such as when a predator captures prey or a blood meal is obtained) and the gut normally has large storage capacity.
3.6.1 Structure of the gut
There are three main regions to the insect gut (or alimentary canal), with sphincters (valves) controlling food–fluid movement between regions (Fig. 3.13). The foregut (stomodeum) is concerned with ingestion, storage, grinding and transport of food to the next region, the midgut (mesenteron). In the midgut, digestive enzymes are produced and secreted, and absorption of the products of digestion occurs. The material remaining in the gut lumen, together with urine from the Malpighian tubules, then enters the hindgut (proctodeum), where absorption of water,

salts and other valuable molecules occurs, prior to elimination of the faeces through the anus. The gut epithelium is one cell-layer thick throughout the length of the canal, and rests on a basement membrane surrounded by a variably developed muscle layer. Both the foregut and hindgut have a cuticular lining, which is lacking in the midgut.
Regions of the gut display local specializations, which are variously developed in different insects, depending on diet. Typically, the foregut is subdivided into a pharynx, an oesophagus (esophagus) and a crop (food storage area), and in insects that ingest solid food there is often a grinding organ, the proventriculus (or gizzard). The proventriculus is especially well developed in Orthoptera and Blattodea, such as crickets, cockroaches and termites, in which the epithelium is longitudinally ridged and armed with spines or teeth. At the anterior end of the foregut, the mouth opens into a preoral cavity, which is bounded by the bases of the mouthparts and often divided into an upper area, or cibarium, and a lower part, or salivarium (Fig. 3.14a). The paired labial or salivary glands vary in size and arrangement from simple elongated tubes to complex branched or lobed structures.

82 Internal anatomy and physiology

Complicated glands occur in many Hemiptera, which produce two types of saliva (see section 3.6.2). In Lepidoptera, the labial glands produce silk, whereas mandibular glands secrete the saliva. Several types of secretory cell may occur in the salivary glands of one insect. The secretions from these cells are transported along cuticular ducts and emptied into the ventral part of the preoral cavity. In insects that store meals in their foregut, the crop may take up the greater portion of the food and often is capable of extreme distension, with a posterior sphincter controlling food retention. The crop may be an enlargement of part of the tubular gut (Fig. 3.7) or a lateral diverticulum.
The generalized midgut has two main areas – the tubular ventriculus and blind-ending lateral diverticula called caeca (ceca). Most cells of the midgut are structurally similar, being columnar and with microvilli (finger-like protrusions) covering the inner surface. The distinction between the almost indiscernible foregut epithelium and the thickened epithelium of the midgut usually is visible in histological sections (Fig. 3.15). The midgut epithelium mostly is separated from the food by a thin sheath called the peritrophic matrix (or membrane or

envelope), which consists of a network of chitin fibrils in a protein–glycoprotein matrix. Some of these proteins, called peritrophins, may have evolved from gastrointestinal mucus proteins by acquiring the ability to bind chitin. The peritrophic membrane either is delaminated from the whole midgut or is produced by cells in the anterior region of the midgut. Exceptionally, Hemiptera and Thysanoptera lack a peritrophic membrane, as do just the adults of several other orders, such as Lepidoptera.
Typically, the beginning of the hindgut is defined by the entry point of the Malpighian tubules, often into a distinct pylorus forming a muscular pyloric sphincter, followed by the ileum, colon and rectum. The main functions of the hindgut are the absorption of water, salts and other useful substances from the faeces and urine. A detailed discussion of the structure and function of the hindgut is presented in section 3.7.1.
3.6.2 Saliva and food ingestion
Salivary secretions dilute the ingested food and adjust its pH and ionic content. The saliva often contains

The gut, digestion and nutrition 83

digestive enzymes and in blood-feeding insects, anticoagulants and thinning agents are also present. In insects with extra-intestinal digestion, such as predatory Hemiptera, digestive enzymes are exported into the food and the resulting liquid is ingested. Most Hemiptera produce an alkaline watery saliva that is a vehicle for enzymes (either digestive or lytic), and a proteinaceous solidifying saliva that either forms a complete sheath around the mouthparts (stylets) as they pierce and penetrate the food or just a securing flange at the point of entry (section 11.2.4, Fig. 11.4c). Stylet-sheath feeding is characteristic of many phloemand xylem-feeding Hemiptera, such as aphids, scale insects (coccoids) and spittle bugs, which leave visible tracks formed of exuded solidifying saliva in the plant tissue on which they have fed. The stylet-sheath track can be either intercellular or intracellular, depending on the hemipteran species. The sheath may function to guide the stylets, prevent loss of fluid from damaged cells, and/or absorb necrosis-inducing compounds to reduce defensive reaction by the plant. By comparison, certain leafhoppers (the Typhlocybinae) and many Heteroptera feed by moving the stylets so as to rupture plant cells, and these bugs mostly feed intracellularly on leaf or stem parenchyma cells rather than in vascular tissue. This cell-rupture strategy includes a macerate-and-flush technique in which salivary enzymes dissolve cell walls, as in Miridae, and a lacerate-and-flush method in which stylet movement damages plant cells, as in Lygaeidae. The released plant fluids are “flushed out” with saliva and ingested by sucking. A third feeding strategy, osmotic-pump feeding, occurs in Coreidae and involves increasing the osmotic concentration in the intercellular spaces to acquire (“pump”) plant-cell contents without mechanically damaging the cell membranes. Coreid feeding causes collapsed cells and watery lesions.
In fluid-feeding insects, prominent dilator muscles attach to the walls of the pharynx and/or the preoral cavity (cibarium) to form a pump (Fig. 3.14b), although most other insects have some sort of pharyngeal pump (Fig. 3.14a) for drinking and for air intake to facilitate cuticle expansion during a moult.
3.6.3 Digestion of food
Most digestion occurs in the midgut, where the epithelial cells produce and secrete digestive enzymes and also absorb the resultant food breakdown products.

Insect food consists principally of polymers of carbohydrates and proteins, which are digested by enzymatically breaking these large molecules into small monomers. The midgut pH usually is 6.0–7.5, although very alkaline values (pH 9–12) occur in many plant-feeding insects that extract hemicelluloses from plant cell walls, and very low pH values occur in many Diptera. High pH may prevent or reduce the binding of dietary tannins to food proteins, thereby increasing the digestibility of ingested plants. In some insects, gut lumenal surfactants (detergents) may have an important role in preventing the formation of tannin–protein complexes, particularly in insects with near-neutral gut pH.
In most insects, the midgut epithelium is separated from the food bolus by the peritrophic matrix (also called the peritrophic membrane or envelope; see section 3.6.1), which constitutes a very efficient high-flux sieve. It is perforated by pores, which allow passage of small molecules while restricting large molecules, bacteria and food particles from directly accessing the midgut cells. The peritrophic membrane also may protect herbivorous insects from ingested allelochemicals such as tannins (section 11.2). In some insects, all or most midgut digestion occurs inside the peritrophic membrane in the endoperitrophic space. In others, only initial digestion occurs there and smaller food molecules then diffuse out into the ectoperitrophic space, where further digestion takes place (Fig. 3.16). A final phase of digestion usually occurs on the surface of the midgut microvilli, where certain enzymes are either trapped in a mucopolysaccharide coating or bound to the cell membrane. Thus, the peritrophic membrane forms a permeability barrier and helps to compartmentalize the phases of digestion, in addition to providing mechanical protection of the midgut cells, which was once believed to be its principal function. Fluid containing partially digested food molecules and digestive enzymes is thought to circulate through the midgut in a posterior direction in the endoperitrophic space and forwards in the ectoperitrophic space, as indicated in Fig. 3.16. This endo–ectoperitrophic circulation may facilitate digestion by moving food molecules to sites of final digestion and absorption, and/or by conserving digestive enzymes, which are removed from the food bolus before it passes to the hindgut.
Unusually, both Hemiptera and Thysanoptera (but not Psocodea), which lack a peritrophic membrane, have an extracellular lipoprotein membrane, the

perimicrovillar membrane (PPM), ensheathing the microvilli of the midgut cells and forming a closed space. The PPM and the associated perimicrovillar space may function to improve absorption of organic molecules, such as amino acids, by generating a concentration gradient between the liquid contents of the gut lumen and the fluid in the perimicrovillar space adjacent to the midgut cells. The PPM contains membrane-bound alpha-glucosidase, which breaks down sucrose in the ingested plant sap.
3.6.4 The fat body
In many insects, especially in holometabolous larvae, fat body tissue is a conspicuous internal component (Fig. 3.7 and Fig. 3.15), typically forming a pale tissue comprising loose sheets, ribbons or lobes of cells lying in the haemocoel. The structure of this organ is ill-defined and taxonomically variable, but often caterpillars and other larvae have a peripheral fat body beneath the cuticle and a central layer around the gut. The fat body has multiple metabolic functions, including: the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and nitrogenous compounds; the storage of glycogen, fat and protein; the synthesis and regulation of blood sugar; the synthesis of major haemolymph proteins (such as haemoglobins, vitellogenins for yolk formation, and storage proteins); and as an endocrine organ producing growth factors and hydroxylating the ecdysone synthesized in the prothoracic glands to 20-hydroxyecdysone (the active moulting hormone;

section 3.3.2). Fat body cells can switch their activities in response to nutritional and hormonal signals in order to supply the requirements of insect growth, metamorphosis and reproduction. For example, specific storage proteins are synthesized by the fat body during the final larval instar of holometabolous insects, and accumulate in the haemolymph to be used during metamorphosis as a source of amino acids for the synthesis of proteins during pupation. Calliphorin, a haemolymph storage protein synthesized in the fat body of larval blow flies (Diptera: Calliphoridae: Calliphora), may form about 75% (about 7 mg) of the haemolymph protein of a late-instar maggot; the amount of calliphorin falls to around 3 mg at the time of pupariation and to 0.03 mg after emergence of the adult fly. The production and deposition of proteins specifically for amino acid storage is a feature that insects share with seed plants but not with vertebrates. Humans, for example, excrete any dietary amino acids that are in excess of immediate needs.
The principal cell type found in the fat body is the trophocyte (or adipocyte), which is responsible for most of the above metabolic and storage functions. Visible differences in the extent of the fat body in different individuals of the same insect species reflect the amount of material stored in the trophocytes; little body fat indicates either active tissue construction or starvation. Two other cell types – urocytes and bacteriocytes (also called mycetocytes) – may occur in the fat body of some insect groups. Urocytes temporarily store spherules of urates, including uric acid, one of the nitrogenous waste products of

The gut, digestion and nutrition 85

insects. Amongst studied cockroaches, rather than being permanent stores of excreted waste uric acid (storage excretion), urocytes recycle urate nitrogen, perhaps with assistance of mycetocyte bacteria. Bacteriocytes (mycetocytes) contain symbiotic microorganisms, and are either scattered through the fat body of cockroaches or are contained within special organs, sometimes surrounded by the fat body. These symbionts are important in insect nutrition.
3.6.5 Nutrition and microorganisms
Broadly defined, nutrition concerns the nature and processing of foods needed to meet the requirements for growth and development, involving feeding behaviour (Chapter 2) and digestion. Insects often have unusual or restricted diets. Sometimes, although only one or a few foods are eaten, the diet provides a complete range of the chemicals essential to metabolism. In these cases, monophagy is a specialization without nutritional limitations. In other cases, a restricted diet may require utilization of microorganisms in digesting or supplementing the directly available nutrients. In particular, insects cannot synthesize sterols (required for synthesis of moulting hormone) or carotenoids (used in visual pigments), and these must come from the diet or from microorganisms.
Insects may harbour extracellular or intracellular microorganisms, which are referred to as symbionts because they are dependent on their insect hosts. These microorganisms contribute to the nutrition of their hosts by functioning in sterol, vitamin, carbohydrate or amino acid synthesis and/or metabolism. Symbiotic microorganisms may be bacteria or bacteroids, yeasts or other unicellular fungi, or protists. Historically, studies on their function were hampered by difficulties in removing them (e.g. with antibiotics, to produce aposymbiotic hosts) without harming the host insect, and also in culturing the microorganisms outside the host. The diets of their hosts provided some clues as to the functions of these microorganisms. Insect hosts include many sap-sucking hemipterans (such as aphids, psylloids, whiteflies, scale insects, thrips, leafhoppers and cicadas) and sap- and blood-sucking heteropterans (Hemiptera), parasitic lice (Psocodea), some wood-feeding insects (such as termites and some longicorn beetles and weevils), many seed- or grain-feeding insects (certain beetles), and some omnivorous insects (such as cockroaches, some termites and some ants). Predatory insects never seem

to contain such symbionts. That microorganisms are required by insects on suboptimal diets has been confirmed by modern studies showing, for example, that critical dietary shortfall in certain essential amino acids in aposymbiotic aphids is compensated for by production by Buchnera symbionts (Gammaproteobacteria). Similarly, the nutritionally poor xylem-sap diet of sharpshooters (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) is augmented by the biosyntheses of its two main symbionts – Sulcia muelleri (Bacteroidetes), which has genes for the synthesis of essential amino acids, and Baumannia cicadellinicola (Gammaproteobacteria), which provides its host with cofactors including B-vitamins. In some termites, spirochaete bacteria provide much of a colony’s nitrogen, carbon and energy requirements via acetogenesis and nitrogen fixation.
Extracellular symbionts may be free in the gut lumen or housed in diverticula or pockets of the midgut or hindgut. For example, termite hindguts contain a veritable fermenter, comprising many bacteria, fungi and protists, including flagellates. These assist in the degradation of the otherwise refractory dietary lignocellulose, and in the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen. The process involves generation of methane, and calculations suggest that tropical termites’ symbiont-assisted cellulose digestion produces a significant proportion of the world’s methane (a greenhouse gas).
Transmission of extracellular symbionts from one individual insect to another involves oral uptake, often by the offspring. Microorganisms may be acquired from the anus or the excreta of other individuals, or eaten at a specific time, as in some bugs, in which the newly hatched young eat the contents of special symbiont-containing capsules deposited with the eggs.
Intracellular symbionts (endosymbionts) may occur in as many as 70% of all insect species. Endosymbionts probably mostly have a mutualistic association with their host insect, but some appear parasitic on their host. Examples of the latter include Wolbachia (section 5.10.4, although even this bacterium may sometimes have nutritional benefits for the host insect, as in the bed bug Cimex lectularius), Spiroplasma and microsporidia. Endosymbionts may be housed in the gut epithelium, as in lygaeid bugs and some weevils; however, most insects with intracellular microorganisms house them in symbiont-containing cells called bacteriocytes or mycetocytes. These cells are in the body cavity, usually associated with the fat body or the gonads, and often in special aggregations, forming an organ called a bacteriome or mycetome. In such

insects, the symbionts are transferred to the ovary and then to the eggs or embryos prior to oviposition or parturition – a process referred to as vertical or transovarial transmission. Lacking evidence for lateral transfer (to an unrelated host), this method of transmission, which is found in many Hemiptera and cockroaches, indicates a very close association or coevolution of the insects and their microorganisms. Evidence of benefits of endosymbionts to their hosts is accruing rapidly due to genome sequencing and studies of gene expression. For example, as mentioned above, the provision of the otherwise dietarily scarce essential amino acids to aphids by their bacteriocyte-associated Buchnera symbiont is well substantiated. Of interest for further research is the suggestion that aphid biotypes with Buchnera bacteriocytes show enhanced ability to transmit certain plant viruses of the genus Luteovirus relative to antibiotic-treated, symbiont-free individuals. The relationship between bacteriocyte endosymbionts and their phloem-feeding host insects is a very tight phylogenetic association (cf. Wolbachia infections, section 5.10.4), suggesting a very long association with co-diversification.
Some insects that maintain fungi essential to their diet cultivate them externally to their body as a means of converting woody substances to an assimilable form. Examples are the fungus gardens of some ants (Formicidae) and termites (Termitidae) (section 9.5.2 and section 9.5.3), and the fungi transmitted by certain timber pests, namely, wood wasps (Hymenoptera: Siricidae) and ambrosia beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytinae).
The genomes of Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae and Bombyx morii were found to lack cellulase genes, and thus endogenous cellulases were presumed to be absent from all insects. However, careful experiments on cellulose-ingesting insects show that at least some cockroaches and termites, crickets, longicorn beetles and the mustard leaf beetle, Phaedon cochleariae (Chrysomelidae), are capable of expressing endogenous cellulases and do not necessarily rely solely on symbionts.
3.7 THE EXCRETORY SYSTEM AND WASTE DISPOSAL
Excretion – the removal from the body of the waste products of metabolism, especially nitrogenous compounds – is essential. It differs from defecation in that excretory wastes have been metabolized in cells of

the body rather than simply passing directly from the mouth to the anus (sometimes essentially unchanged chemically). Of course, insect faeces, either in liquid form or packaged in pellets and known as frass, contain both undigested food and metabolic excretions. Aquatic insects eliminate dilute wastes from their anus directly into the water, and so their faecal material is flushed away. In comparison, terrestrial insects generally must conserve water. This requires efficient waste disposal in a concentrated or even dry form, while simultaneously avoiding the potentially toxic effects of nitrogen. Furthermore, both terrestrial and aquatic insects must conserve ions, such as sodium (Na+), potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl−), which may be limiting in their food or, in aquatic insects, lost into the water by diffusion. Production of insect urine or frass therefore results from two intimately related processes: excretion and osmoregulation – the maintenance of a favourable body-fluid composition (osmotic and ionic homeostasis). The system responsible for excretion and osmoregulation is referred to loosely as the excretory system, and its activities are performed largely by the Malpighian tubules and hindgut as outlined below. However, the haemolymph composition in freshwater insects must be regulated in response to the constant loss of salts (as ions) to the surrounding water, and ionic regulation involves both the typical excretory system and special cells, called chloride cells, which usually are associated with the hindgut. Chloride cells are capable of absorbing inorganic ions from very dilute solutions, and are best studied in aquatic bugs and nymphal dragonflies and damselflies.
3.7.1 The Malpighian tubules and rectum
The main organs of excretion and osmoregulation in insects are the Malpighian tubules and the rectum and/or ileum, which all act together (Fig. 3.17). Malpighian tubules are outgrowths of the alimentary canal and consist of long, thin tubules (Fig. 3.1) formed of a single layer of cells surrounding a blind-ending lumen. They range in number from as few as two in most scale insects (coccoids) to over 200 in large locusts. Generally, they are free, waving around in the haemolymph, where they filter out solutes. Aphids are the only insects that lack Malpighian tubules, although they are reduced to papillae in Strepsiptera. The vignette at the beginning of this chapter shows the gut of Locusta, but with only a few of the many

Malpighian tubules depicted. Similar structures are believed to have arisen convergently in different arthropod groups, such as myriapods and arachnids, in response to the physiological stresses of life on dry land. Insect Malpighian tubules are considered to belong to the hindgut and to be ectodermal in origin. Their position marks the junction of the midgut and the cuticle-lined hindgut.
The anterior hindgut is called the ileum, the generally narrower middle portion is the colon, and the expanded posterior section is the rectum (Fig. 3.13). In many terrestrial insects, the rectum is the only site of water and solute resorption from the excreta, but in other insects, for example the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria (Orthoptera: Acrididae), the ileum makes some contribution to osmoregulation. In a few insects, such as the cockroach Periplaneta americana (Blattodea: Blattidae), even the colon may be a potential site of some fluid absorption. The resorptive role of the rectum (and sometimes the anterior hindgut) is indicated by

its anatomy. In most insects, specific parts of the rectal epithelium are thickened to form rectal pads or papillae, composed of aggregations of columnar cells. Typically, there are six pads arranged longitudinally, but there may be fewer pads or many papillate ones.
The general picture of insect excretory processes outlined here is applicable to most freshwater species and to the adults of many terrestrial species. The Malpighian tubules produce a filtrate (the primary urine) that is isosmotic but ionically dissimilar to the haemolymph, and then the hindgut, especially the rectum, selectively resorbs water and certain solutes but eliminates others (Fig. 3.17). Details of Malpighian tubule and rectal structure and of filtration and absorption mechanisms differ between taxa, in relation to both taxonomic position and dietary composition (Box 3.4 gives an example of one type of specialization – cryptonephric systems), but the excretory system of the desert locust S. gregaria (Fig. 3.18) exemplifies the general structure

Box 3.4 Cryptonephric systems*
Many larval and adult Coleoptera, larval Lepidoptera and some larval Symphyta have a modified arrangement of the excretory system that is involved either with efficient dehydration of faeces before their elimination (in beetles) or ionic regulation (in plant-feeding caterpillars). These insects have a cryptonephric system in which the distal ends of the Malpighian tubules are held in contact with the rectal wall by the perinephric membrane. Such an arrangement allows some beetles that live on a very dry diet, such as stored grain or dry carcasses, to be extraordinarily efficient in their conservation of water. Water even may be extracted from the humid air in the rectum. In the cryptonephric system of the mealworm, Tenebrio molitor (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), shown here, ions (principally of potassium chloride, KCl) are transported into, and concentrated in, the six Malpighian tubules, creating an osmotic gradient that draws water from the surrounding perirectal space and the rectal lumen. The tubule fluid is then transported forwards to the free portion of each tubule, from which it is passed to the haemolymph or recycled in the rectum.

and principles of insect excretion. The Malpighian
tubules of the locust produce an isosmotic filtrate of the haemolymph, which is high in K+, low in Na+, and has Cl− as the major anion. The active transport of ions, especially K+, into the tubule lumen generates
an osmotic pressure gradient so that water passively
follows (Fig. 3.18a). Sugars and most amino acids also
are filtered passively from the haemolymph (probably

via junctions between the tubule cells), whereas the amino acid proline (later used as an energy source by the rectal cells) and non-metabolizable and toxic organic compounds are transported actively into the tubule lumen. Sugars, such as sucrose and trehalose, are resorbed from the lumen and returned to the haemolymph. The continuous secretory activity of each Malpighian tubule leads to a flow of primary

Pathways of water movement are represented by open arrows, and solute movements by black arrows. Ions are actively transported from the rectal lumen (compartment 1) to the adjacent cell cytoplasm (compartment 2) and then to the intercellular spaces (compartment 3). Mitochondria are positioned so as to provide the energy for this active ion transport. Fluid in the spaces is hyperosmotic (higher ion concentration) to the rectal lumen and draws water by osmosis from the lumen via the septate junctions between the cells. Water thus moves from compartment 1 to 3 to 4 and finally to 5, the haemolymph in the haemocoel. (After Bradley 1985.)

urine from its lumen towards and into the gut. In the rectum, the urine is modified by removal of solutes and water to maintain fluid and ionic homeostasis of the locust’s body (Fig. 3.18b). Specialized cells in the rectal pads carry out active recovery of Cl− under hormonal stimulation. This pumping of Cl− generates electrical and osmotic gradients that lead to some resorption of other ions, water, amino acids and acetate.

3.7.2 Nitrogen excretion
Many predatory, blood-feeding and even plant-feeding insects ingest nitrogen, particularly certain amino acids, far in excess of requirements. Most insects excrete nitrogenous metabolic wastes at some or all stages of their life, although some nitrogen is stored in the fat body or as proteins in the haemolymph in some

insects. Many aquatic insects and some flesh-feeding flies excrete large amounts of ammonia, whereas in terrestrial insects wastes generally consist of uric acid and/or certain of its salts (urates), often in combination with urea, pteridines, certain amino acids and/or relatives of uric acid, such as hypoxanthine, allantoin and allantoic acid. Amongst these waste compounds, ammonia is relatively toxic and usually must be excreted as a dilute solution, or else rapidly volatilized from the cuticle or faeces (as in cockroaches). Urea is less toxic but is more soluble, requiring a lot of water for its elimination. Uric acid and urates require less water for their synthesis than either ammonia or urea (Fig. 3.19), are non-toxic and, having low solubility in water (at least in acidic conditions), can be excreted essentially dry, without causing osmotic problems. Waste dilution can be achieved easily by aquatic insects, but water conservation is essential for terrestrial insects and uric acid excretion (uricotelism) is highly advantageous.
Historically, deposition of urates in specific cells of the fat body (section 3.6.4) was viewed as “excretion” by storage of uric acid. However, in at least some insects such as cockroaches, it is now known to constitute a metabolic store for recycling by the insect with the assistance of symbiotic microorganisms. Cockroaches, including P. americana, do not excrete uric acid in the faeces even if fed a high-nitrogen diet but do produce large quantities of internally stored urates. The cockroach fat body houses endosymbiont bacteria (Blattabacterium) capable of synthesizing amino acids from ammonia, urea and glutamate, as determined from genome analysis.

By-products of feeding and metabolism need not be excreted as waste – for example, the antifeedant defensive compounds of plants may be sequestered directly or may form the biochemical base for synthesis of chemicals used in communication (Chapter 4), including in warning and defence. White-pigmented uric-acid derivatives colour the epidermis of some insects and provide the white in the wing scales of certain butterflies (Lepidoptera: Pieridae).
3.8 REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS
The reproductive organs of insects exhibit an incredible variety of forms, but there is a basic design and function to each component so that even the most aberrant reproductive system can be understood in terms of a generalized plan. Individual components of the reproductive system can vary in shape (e.g. of gonads and accessory glands), position (e.g. of the attachment of accessory glands) and number (e.g. of ovarian or testicular tubes, or sperm storage organs) between different insect groups, and sometimes even between different species within a genus. Knowledge of the homology of the components assists in interpreting structure and function in different insects. Generalized male and female systems are depicted in Fig. 3.20, and a comparison of the corresponding reproductive structures of male and female insects is provided in Table 3.2. Many other aspects of reproduction, including copulation and regulation of physiological processes, are discussed in detail in Chapter 5.

3.8.1 The female reproductive system
The main functions of the female reproductive system are egg production, including the provision of a protective coating in many insects, and the storage of the male’s spermatozoa until the eggs are ready to be fertilized. Transport of the spermatozoa to the female’s storage organ and their subsequent controlled release requires movement of the spermatozoa, which in some species is mediated by muscular contractions of parts of the female reproductive tract.
The basic components of the female reproductive system (Fig. 3.20a) are paired ovaries, which empty their mature oocytes (eggs) via the calyces (singular: calyx) into the lateral oviducts, which unite to form the common (or median) oviduct. The gonopore (opening) of the common oviduct usually is concealed in an inflection of the body wall that typically forms a cavity, the genital chamber. This chamber serves as a copulatory pouch during mating, and thus often is known as the bursa copulatrix. Its external opening is the vulva. In many insects, the vulva is narrow and the genital chamber becomes an enclosed pouch or tube, referred to as the vagina. Two sorts of ectodermal glands open into the genital chamber. The first is the spermatheca, which stores spermatozoa until needed for egg fertilization. Typically, the spermatheca is single, generally sac-like with a slender duct, and often has a diverticulum that forms a tubular spermathecal gland. The gland or glandular cells within the storage part of the spermatheca provide nourishment to the contained spermatozoa. The second type of ectodermal gland, known collectively as accessory glands, opens more posteriorly in the genital chamber and has a variety of functions, depending on the species (see section 5.8).
Each ovary is composed of a cluster of ovarian or egg tubes, the ovarioles, each consisting of a terminal filament, a germarium (in which mitosis gives rise to primary oocytes), a vitellarium (in which oocytes grow by deposition of yolk in a process known as vitellogenesis; section 5.11.1) and a pedicel (or stalk). An ovariole contains a series of developing oocytes, each surrounded by a layer of follicle cells forming an epithelium (the oocyte and its epithelium is termed a follicle); the youngest oocytes occur near the apical germarium and the most mature near the pedicel.

Three different types of ovariole are recognized, based on the manner in which the oocytes are nourished. A panoistic ovariole lacks specialized nutritive cells so that it contains only a string of follicles, with the oocytes obtaining nutrients from the haemolymph via the follicular epithelium. Ovarioles of the other two types contain trophocytes (nurse cells) that contribute to the nutrition of the developing oocytes. In a telotrophic (or acrotrophic) ovariole, the trophocytes are confined to the germarium and remain connected to the oocytes by cytoplasmic strands as the oocytes move down the ovariole. In a polytrophic ovariole, a number of trophocytes are connected to each oocyte and move down the ovariole with it, providing nutrients until depleted; thus individual oocytes alternate with groups of successively smaller trophocytes. Different suborders or orders of insects usually have only one of these three ovariole types.
Accessory glands of the female reproductive tract often are referred to as colleterial (or cement) glands because in most insect orders their secretions surround and protect the eggs or cement them to the substrate (section 5.8). In other insects, the accessory glands may function as poison glands (as in many Hymenoptera) or as “milk” glands in the few insects (e.g. tsetse flies, Glossina spp.) that exhibit adenotrophic viviparity (section 5.9). Accessory glands of a variety of forms and functions appear to have been derived independently in different orders and even may be non-homologous within an order, as in Coleoptera.
3.8.2 The male reproductive system
The main functions of the male reproductive system are the production and storage of spermatozoa, and their transport in a viable state to the reproductive tract of the female. Morphologically, the male tract consists of paired testes, each containing a series of testicular tubes or follicles (in which spermatozoa are produced), which open separately into the mesodermally derived sperm duct or vas deferens, which usually expands posteriorly to form a sperm-storage organ, or seminal vesicle (Fig. 3.20b). Typically, tubular, paired accessory glands are formed as diverticula of the vasa deferentia, but sometimes the

Trim size: 189mm x 246mm

Gullan c03.tex V2 - 05/16/2014 2:33 P.M. Page 93

Further reading 93

vasa deferentia themselves are glandular and fulfil the functions of accessory glands (see below). The paired vasa deferentia unite where they lead into the ectodermally derived ejaculatory duct – the tube that transports the semen or the sperm package to the gonopore. In a few insects, particularly certain flies, the accessory glands consist of an enlarged glandular part of the ejaculatory duct.
Thus, the accessory glands of male insects can be classified into two types according to their mesodermal or ectodermal derivation. Almost all are mesodermal in origin, and those apparently of ectodermal origin have been poorly studied. Furthermore, the mesodermal structures of the male tract frequently differ morphologically from the basic paired sacs or tubes described above. For example, in male cockroaches and many other orthopteroids, the seminal vesicles and the numerous accessory gland tubules (Fig. 3.1) are clustered into a single median structure called the mushroom body. Secretions of the male accessory glands form the spermatophore (the package that surrounds the spermatozoa of many insects), contribute to the seminal fluid, which nourishes the spermatozoa during transport to the female, are involved in activation (induction of motility) of the spermatozoa, and may alter female behaviour (induce non-receptivity to further males and/or stimulate oviposition; see section 5.4, section 5.11 and Box 5.6).

96 Sensory systems and behaviour

The success of insects derives, at least in part, from their ability to sense and interpret their surroundings and to discriminate on a fine scale. Insects respond selectively to cues from a heterogeneous environment, differentiate between hosts (both plant and animal), and respond to microclimatic factors, such as humidity, temperature and airflow.
Sensory complexity allows for both simple and complex behaviours of insects. For example, to control flight, the aerial environment must be sensed and appropriate responses made. Because much insect activity is nocturnal, orientation and navigation cannot rely solely on conventional visual cues, and in many night-active species, odours and sounds play a major role in communication. The range of sensory information used by insects differs from that of humans. We rely heavily on visual information, and although many insects have well-developed vision, most insects make greater use of olfaction and hearing than humans do.
The insect is isolated from its external surroundings by a relatively inflexible, insensitive and impermeable cuticular barrier. The answer to the enigma of how this armoured insect can perceive its immediate environment lies in frequent and abundant cuticular structures that detect external stimuli. Sensory organs (sensilla, singular: sensillum) protrude from the cuticle, or sometimes lie within or beneath it. Specialized cells detect stimuli that may be categorized as mechanical, thermal, chemical and visual. Other cells (the neurons) transmit messages to the central nervous system (section 3.2), where they are integrated. The nervous system instigates and controls appropriate behaviours, such as posture, movement and feeding, as well as behaviours associated with mating and oviposition.
This chapter surveys these sensory systems and presents selected behaviours that are elicited or modified by environmental stimuli. The means of detection and, where relevant, production of these stimuli are treated in the following sequence: touch, position, sound, temperature, chemicals (with particular emphasis on communication chemicals, called pheromones) and light. The chapter concludes with a section that relates some aspects of insect behaviour to

the preceding discussion on stimuli. Boxes cover four special topics: aural location of a host by a parasitoid fly (Box 4.1); reception of communication molecules (Box 4.2); the electroantennogram (Box 4.3); and biological clocks (Box 4.4).
4.1 MECHANICAL STIMULI
The stimuli grouped here are those associated with distortion caused by mechanical movement, as a result of the environment itself, the insect in relation to the environment, or internal forces derived from the muscles. The mechanical stimuli sensed include touch, body stretching and stress, position, pressure, gravity and vibrations, including pressure changes of the air and substrate involved in sound transmission and hearing.
4.1.1 Tactile mechanoreception
Insects are covered externally with cuticular projections, called microtrichia if many arise from one cell, or hairs, bristles, setae or macrotrichia if they are of multicellular origin. Most flexible projections arise from an innervated socket. These are sensilla, termed trichoid sensilla (literally, hair-like little sense organs), and develop from epidermal cells that switch from cuticle production. Three cells are involved (Fig. 4.1): 1 a trichogen cell, which grows the conical hair; 2 a tormogen cell, which grows the socket; 3 a sensory neuron, or nerve cell, which grows a dendrite into the hair and an axon that winds inwards to link with other axons to form a nerve connected to the central nervous system.
Fully developed trichoid sensilla fulfil tactile functions. As touch sensilla they respond to the movement of the hair by firing impulses from the dendrite at a frequency related to the extent of the deflection. Touch sensilla are stimulated only during actual movement of the hair. Each hair can differ in sensitivity, with some being so sensitive that they respond to vibrations of air particles caused by noise (section 4.1.3).

The second type, stretch receptors, comprise internal proprioceptors associated with muscles such as those of the abdominal and gut walls. Alteration of the length of the muscle fibre is detected by multiple-inserted neuron endings, producing variation in the rate of firing of the nerve cell. Stretch receptors monitor body functions such as abdominal or gut distension, or ventilation rate.
The third type, stress detectors on the cuticle, function via stress receptors called campaniform sensilla. Each sensillum comprises a central cap or peg surrounded by a raised circle of cuticle and with a single neuron per sensillum (Fig. 4.2b). These sensilla are located on joints, such as those of legs and wings, and other places liable to distortion. Locations include the haltere (the knob-like modified hind wing of Diptera), at the base of which there are dorsal and ventral groups of campaniform sensilla that respond to distortions created during flight.

4.1.2 Position mechanoreception (proprioceptors)
Insects require continuous knowledge of the relative position of their body parts, such as limbs or head, and need to detect how the orientation of the body relates to gravity. This information is conveyed by proprioceptors (self-perception receptors), of which three types are described here. One type of trichoid sensillum gives a continuous sensory output at a frequency that varies with the position of the hair. Sensilla often form a bed of grouped small hairs, a hair plate, at joints or at the neck, in contact with the cuticle of an adjacent body part (Fig. 4.2a). The degree of flexion of the joint gives a variable stimulus to the sensilla, thereby allowing monitoring of the relative positions of different parts of the body.

4.1.3 Sound reception
Sound is a pressure fluctuation transmitted in a wave form via movement of the air or the substrate, including water. Sound and hearing are terms often applied to the quite limited range of frequencies of airborne vibration that humans perceive with their ears, usually in adults this is from 20 to 20,000 Hz (1 hertz (Hz) is a frequency of one cycle per second). Such a definition of sound is restrictive, particularly as amongst insects some receive vibrations ranging from as low as 1–2 Hz to ultrasound frequencies perhaps as high as 100 kHz. Specialized emission and reception across this range of frequencies of vibration are considered here. The reception of these frequencies involves a variety of organs, none of which resemble the ears of mammals.
An important role of insect sound is in intraspecific acoustic communication. For example, courtship in most orthopterans is acoustic, with males producing species-specific sounds (“songs”) that the predominantly non-singing females detect and upon which they base their choice of mate. Hearing also allows detection of predators, such as insectivorous bats, which use ultrasound in hunting. It is probable that each species of insect detects sound within one or two relatively narrow ranges of frequencies that relate to these functions.
The insect mechanoreceptive communication system can be viewed as a continuum from substrate

vibration reception, grading through the reception of very near airborne vibration, to hearing of more distant sound using thin cuticular membranes called tympana (singular: tympanum; adjective: tympanal). Substrate signalling probably appeared first in insect evolution; the sensory organs used to detect substrate vibrations appear to have been co-opted and modified many times in different insect groups to allow for reception of airborne sound at considerable distance and at a range of frequencies.
Non-tympanal vibration reception
Two types of vibration or sound reception that do not involve tympana (see next subsection for tympanal reception) are the detection of substrate-borne signals and the ability to perceive the relatively large translational movements of the surrounding medium (air or water) that occur very close to a sound. The latter, referred to as near-field sound, is detected by either sensory hairs or specialized sensory organs.
A simple form of sound reception occurs in species that have very sensitive, elongate, trichoid sensilla that respond to vibrations produced by a near-field sound. For example, caterpillars of the noctuid moth Barathra brassicae have thoracic hairs about 0.5 mm long that respond optimally to vibrations of 150 Hz. Although in

air this system is effective only for local sounds, caterpillars can respond to the vibrations caused by the audible approach of parasitic wasps.
The cerci of many insects, especially crickets, are clothed in long, fine trichoid sensilla (filiform setae or hairs) that sense air currents, which can convey information about the approach of predatory or parasitic insects or a potential mate. The direction of approach of another animal is indicated by which hairs are deflected; the sensory neuron of each hair is tuned to respond to movement in a particular direction. The dynamics (the time-varying pattern) of air movement gives information on the nature of the stimulus (and thus on what type of animal is approaching), and is indicated by the properties of the mechanosensory hairs. The length of each hair determines the response of its sensory neuron to the stimulus: neurons that innervate short hairs are most sensitive to high-intensity, high-frequency stimuli, whereas long hairs are more sensitive to low-intensity, low-frequency stimuli. The responses of many sensory neurons innervating different hairs on the cerci are integrated in the central nervous system to allow the insect to behave appropriately to detected air movement.
For low-frequency sounds in water (a medium more viscous than air), longer distance transmission is possible. Although few aquatic insects communicate

through underwater sounds, “drumming” sounds are produced by some aquatic larvae to assert territory, and noises are produced by underwater diving hemipterans such as corixids and nepids.
Many insects can detect vibrations transmitted through a substrate at a solid–air or solid–water boundary or along a water–air surface. The perception of substrate vibrations is particularly important for ground-dwelling insects, especially nocturnal species, and social insects living in dark nests. Some insects living on plant surfaces, such as sawflies (Hymenoptera: Pergidae), communicate with each other by tapping the stem. Various plant-feeding bugs (Hemiptera), such as leafhoppers, planthoppers and pentatomids, produce vibratory signals that are transmitted through the host plant. Water-striders (Hemiptera: Gerridae; see Box 10.2) create pulsed waves across the water surface film to communicate in courtship and aggression. Moreover, they can detect the vibrations produced by the struggles of prey that fall onto the water surface. Whirligig beetles (Coleoptera: Gyrinidae; see Fig. 10.7) can navigate using a form of echolocation: waves that move on the water surface ahead of them are reflected from obstacles and are sensed by their antennae in time to take evasive action.
The specialized sensory organs that receive vibrations are subcuticular mechanoreceptors called chordotonal organs. A chordotonal organ consists of one to many scolopidia, each of which consists of three linearly arranged cells: a sub-tympanal cap cell placed on top of a sheath cell (scolopale cell), which envelops the end of a nerve cell dendrite (Fig. 4.3). All adult insects, and many larvae, have a particular chordotonal organ, Johnston’s organ, lying within the pedicel, the second antennal segment. The primary function is to sense movements of the antennal flagellum relative to the rest of the body, as in the detection of flight speed by air movement. Additionally, it functions in hearing in some insects. In male mosquitoes (Culicidae) and midges (Chironomidae), many scolopidia are contained in the swollen pedicel. These scolopidia are attached at one end to the pedicel wall and at the other, sensory, end to the base of the third antennal segment. This greatly modified Johnston’s organ is the male receptor for the female wing tone (see section 4.1.4), as shown when males are rendered unreceptive to the sound of the female by amputation of the terminal flagellum or arista of the antenna.
Detection of substrate vibration involves the subgenual organ, a chordotonal organ located in the

proximal tibia of each leg. Subgenual organs are found in most insects, but not in the Coleoptera and Diptera. The subgenual organ consists of a semi-circle of many sensory cells lying in the haemocoel, connected at one end to the inner cuticle of the tibia, and at the other end to the trachea. There are subgenual organs within all legs: the organs of each pair of legs may respond specifically to substrate-borne sounds of differing frequencies. Vibration reception may involve either direct transfer of low-frequency substrate vibrations to the legs, or there may be more complex amplification and transfer. Airborne vibrations can be detected if they cause vibration of the substrate and hence of the legs.
Tympanal reception
The most elaborate sound reception system in insects involves a specific receptor structure, the tympanum. This membrane responds to distant sounds transmitted by airborne vibration. Tympanal membranes are linked to chordotonal organs and are associated with air-filled sacs, especially modified trachea, that enhance sound reception. Tympanal organs acting as “ears” have evolved in at least seven orders of insects in a diversity of locations: • the ventral thorax between the metathoracic legs of mantids; • the thorax of many noctuid moths; • the prothoracic legs of many orthopterans; • the abdomen of other orthopterans, cicadas, and some moths and beetles; • the wing bases of certain moths and the radial vein of some lacewings; • under the elytra in tiger beetles, which only hear when in flight; • the prosternum of some flies (Box 4.1); • the cervical membranes of a few scarab beetles; • the mouthparts of a few moths.
Variation in the location of these organs and their occurrence in distantly related insect groups indicates that tympanal hearing has evolved several times in insects. Neuroanatomical studies suggest that all insect tympanal organs evolved from proprioceptors, and the wide distribution of proprioceptors throughout the insect cuticle must account for the variety of positions of tympanal organs.
Tympanal sound reception is particularly well developed in orthopterans, especially the crickets and katydids. In most of these ensiferan Orthoptera, the tympanal organs are located in the tibia of each fore

leg (Fig. 4.4; see also Fig. 9.2a). Behind the paired tympanal membranes lies an acoustic trachea that runs from a prothoracic spiracle down each leg to the tympanal organ (Fig. 4.4a).
Katydids (bushcrickets) and crickets have similar hearing systems. The system in crickets appears to be less specialized because their acoustic tracheae remain connected to the ventilatory spiracles of the prothorax. The acoustic tracheae of katydids form a system completely isolated from the ventilatory tracheae, opening via a separate pair of acoustic spiracles. In many katydids, the tibial base has two separated longitudinal slits, each of which leads into a tympanic chamber (Fig. 4.4b). The acoustic trachea, which lies centrally in the leg, is divided in half by a membrane at this point, such that one half closely connects with the anterior and the other half with the posterior tympanal membrane. The primary route of sound to the tympanal organ is usually from the acoustic spiracle and along the acoustic trachea to the tibia. The change in cross-sectional area from the enlargement of the trachea behind each spiracle (sometimes called a tracheal vesicle) to the tympanal organ in the tibia functions as a horn in amplifying the sound. Although the slits of the tympanic chambers allow the entry of sound, their exact function is debatable. They may allow directional hearing, because very small differences in the time of arrival of sound waves at the tympanum can be detected by pressure differences across the membrane.
Entry of sound to the tympanal organs by air- and substrate-borne signals cause the tympanal membranes to vibrate. Vibrations are sensed by three chordotonal organs: the subgenual organ, the intermediate organ and the crista acustica (Fig. 4.4c). The subgenual organs, which have a form and function similar to those in non-orthopteroid insects, are present on all legs, but the crista acustica and intermediate organs are found only on the fore legs in conjunction with the tympana. This implies that the tibial hearing organ is a serial homologue of the proprioceptor units of the mid and hind legs. The crista acustica consists of a row of up to 60 scolopidial cells attached to the acoustic trachea and is the main sensory organ for airborne sound in the 5–50 kHz range. The intermediate organ, which consists of 10–20 scolopidial cells, is posterior to the subgenual organ and is virtually continuous with the crista acustica. The role of the intermediate organ is uncertain but it may respond to airborne sound of frequencies from
