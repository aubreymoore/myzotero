History of Guam
• Prehistory: 1,500 BC to 1521 • Spanish period: 1521 to 1898 • American prewar period: 1892 to 1941
– Under an appointed naval governor
• Japanese occupation: 1941 to 1944 • American period: 1944 to present
– Under an appointed naval governor until 1950 – The organic act of 1950 gave residents US
citizenship with limited political representation

"Invasive species" means an alien species whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health.
- Executive Order 13112 signed by President William Clinton on February 3, 1999.

“invasive species” = “exotic pests”

Why such a fuss about invasive species?
All animals and plants, or their ancestors, arrived on Guam arrived from elsewhere.
So, what’s the fuss with invasive species?

Why such a fuss about invasive species?
Before man, 1 new species arrived on Guam every few thousand years
Currently, 1 new species arrives on Guam every few months
This is 10,000 times the natural rate!

Why such a fuss about invasive species?
Tropical island ecosystems are particularly susceptible to biological invasions for a couple of reasons:
Endemic species are at risk of extinction because they have not evolved defenses against alien predators, parasites, and diseases.
Much ecological and environmental damage is done when newly arrived species undergo an initial population explosion because:
• there are often no pre-existing natural biological control (parasites and predators)
• warm climate allows year round population growth

Plants (Weeds)
All of the 54 weeds listed in McConnell & Gutierrez 2006 are invasive species

Fungi, Bacteria, Viruses
• 6 new plant pathogenic fungi were detected by UOG plant pathologists during 2007
• Most new fungi, bacteria, and viruses are detected only if they cause diseases to man, domesticated animals, or crops

Invasive Species in Guam’s Marine Environment
There are now at least 73 species of non-native organisms found on Guam only in Apra Harbor, which implies they arrived via boat traffic.

This dry dock arrived from Pearl Harbor in 1999 with 42 new species including snails, sponges, bivalves, ascidians, polychaetes, barnacles, bryozoans, and hydrozoans.

Mammals
• Man • Ungulates • Rodents

Ungulates

Amphibians (Frogs & Toads)
• 13 invasive species (1 eradicated) • Cane toad, Bufo marinus, introduced
intentionally in 1937 • 8 new species of frogs detected on Guam
between May 2003 and December 2005

Reptiles (snakes, lizards, turtles)
19 invasive species

Insects
•263 species of insects on Guam are listed as agricultural pests >95% of these are invasive species
•Including non-agricultural pests such as ants, termites, mosquitoes, and household pests invasive insect species on Guam probably exceeds 400

New Insect Pests Detected on Guam Since Jan. 2002

Paracoccus marginatus Aulacaspis yasumatsui Myllocerus sp. Pseudaulacaspis cockerelli Metaleurodes cardini Nipaecoccus nipae Orthezia insignis Aleurotrachelus trachoides Chilades pandava Daphnis nerii Quadrastichus erythrinae Lepisiota frauenfeldi Diaphorina citri Tetraleurodes acaciae Henosepilachna sp.

Why are Hemipterans so invasive?
(The order Hemiptera include scales, mealybugs, whiteflies, aphids, psyllids, leafhoppers)
• Most are small and cryptic • Many are not easily identified as insects • Many reproduce without mating • These sucking insects are often sedentary
and are easily transported on host plants.

Ants
All ants on Guam are invasive species. 30 species

Ant Lepisiota frauenfeldi (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)

Popillia lewisi
1985 – 2003: found only near runways at Andersen Air Force Base
2004: spread throughout Guam

Timeline for Cycad Aulacaspis Scale
• Dec-2003 Detected in Tumon Hotel district on ornamental cycads
• Spreads to wild cycads island-wide within 1 year (Cycas micronesica is a major species in Guam’s ecosystem)
• Feb-2004 A lady beetle,Rhyzobius lophanthae, is released for biocontrol
• 2006 Cycas micronesica listed as a “Threatened Species”

Workshop Announcement
Title: Response to Invasive Species: First Detector Training Workshop
Date & Time: Saturday, October 24, 2009, 9:00 am to 12:00 noon
Location: ALS Building, Room 127, University of Guam
Activity: University of Guam students are invited and encouraged to attend this workshop, which is cosponsored by the University of Guam Cooperative Extension Service and the Western Plant Diagnostic Network (WPDN). During the workshop you will learn what to do when you encounter a plant or animal which you suspect is new to Guam. Rapid detection and implementation of an emergency response plan will reduce economic and environmental damage caused by invasive species.
For more information, contact Roger Brown, University of Guam, 735-2094/2080.

All suspected new invasive species should be reported to:
Dr. Russell Campbell Guam/USDA Plant Inspection Facility Telephone: 475-1426/27 Fax: 477-9487 Email: russell.campbell@agriculture.guam.gov

Invasive species aren’t all bad. They provide job security for biologists.
