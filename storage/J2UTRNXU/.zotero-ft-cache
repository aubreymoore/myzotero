Publishing my Nikola site on github pages was remarkably easy.

    Instructions are found in the Nikola Handbook here: https://getnikola.com/handbook.html#deploying-to-github

    Created a new repo on github called aubreymoore/blog
        IMPORTANT: Go to the settings page for the new repo and enable github pages. The root URL for these pages will be at https://aubreymoore.github.io/blog/

    Created a git repo on my local machine:

  git init .
git remote add origin git@github.com:aubreymoore/blog.git

    Pushed my site to github from the command line:

  nikola github_deploy

    github pages
    Nikola
