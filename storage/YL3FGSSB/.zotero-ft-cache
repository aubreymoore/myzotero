Report
I attended the International Congress on Invertebrate Pathology and Microbial Control & the 51st Annual Meeting of the Society for Invertebrate Pathology to participate in a symposium at this conference entitled The challenge of a virus resistant rhinoceros beetle to palm production in the Paciﬁc and prospects for microbial control organized by Trevor Jackson and Sean Marshall of AgResearch New Zealand and to participate in a meeting to discuss a regional response to Oryctes rhinoceros Biotype G which is has invaded Guam, Hawaii, Palau, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. CRB-G is a serious threat to coconut production, oil palm production, ornamental palms of value to tourism, and sustainability of island ecosystems in general. Without a Paciﬁc-wide regional control eﬀort, CRB-G will spread throughout the Paciﬁc and beyond.
At the symposium, I made an oral presentation entitled Attempted microbial control of coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros, Biotype G on Guam using Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus and Metarhizium majus. I was also coauthor of a second presentation entitled Progress with control of a virus resistant coconut rhinoceros beetle presented by Sean Marshall.
At the meeting, we discussed how to strengthen existing collaboration among partners within Asia and the Paciﬁc who are working on developing an eﬀective response to CRBG. All present agreed on a free exchange of information and biological samples. Meeting notes are documented in a wiki I developed to facilitate sharing information within the CRB-G action group at http://guaminsects.net/CRBG.
Collaboration among partners working to develop an eﬀective response to CRB-G will be essential to building an eﬀective response. Experts at the meeting agreed that ﬁnding an isolate of Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus which can be used as an eﬀective classical biocontrol agent for CRB-G is the most feasible way to control this pest and a search for new virus isolates must take priority. Dr. Nur Ain Farhah from Malaysia oﬀered to send OrNV isolates from her lab for testing against CRB-G at the University of Guam.

UOG Researchers Participate in Symposium on Coconut Rhinoceros Beetles
Researchers from Cooperative Extension & Outreach at the University of Guam recently participated in a Paciﬁc-wide discussion on a new type of coconut rhinoceros beetle called CRB-G which is killing coconut and oil palms in Guam, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and other islands of the Paciﬁc.
A symposium entitled “The challenge of CRB-G to palm production in the Paciﬁc and prospects for microbial control" featured the University’s Aubrey Moore, Jim Grasela, Roland Quitugua, and Ian Iriarte. The discussion took place at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Invertebrate Pathology held on the Gold Coast, Australia in August 2018.
“On Guam, the beetle escaped control following damage caused by Typhoon Dolphin in 2015, which left large numbers of CRB-G breeding sites in the form of piles of decaying vegetation," said Dr. Aubrey Moore, associate professor of entomology. "The control on Guam will only be possible with the introduction of a self-replicating, density-dependent biocontrol agent." Outbreaks of CRB-G are out of control on Guam, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands, and this problematic biotype is spreading to other islands. Other coconut rhinoceros beetle biotypes can be eﬀectively controlled by introducing a naturally occurring virus which only attacks rhino beetles. Unfortunately, CRB-G is resistant to all available isolates of this virus.
The scientists agreed that the most feasible way to stop CRB-G from killing palms and spreading to other islands is to ﬁnd a new isolate of the biocontrol virus which attacks CRB-G and will collaborate on the search for this virus.

Green waste could boost rhino beetle population

Green waste could boost rhino beetle population

Manny Cruz, Pacific Daily News Published 12:35 p.m. ChT Sept. 15, 2018

The population of the invasive coconut rhinoceros beetle boomed in 2015 because of green waste caused by Typhoon Dolphin.

“(Typhoon) Mangkhut definitely isn’t going to make things any better,” said Aubrey Moore, an entomologist at the University of Guam. “(Beetle) grubs eat dead vegetation, and there’s undoubtedly lots of it now.”

Experts predict another boom in the beetle population in about six months unless residents take steps to "sanitize" their property by draping green waste piles in tekken fishing nets, which prevent adult beetles from escaping. Vegetation also be placed in 50-gallon drums housing solar-powered ultraviolet lights, and covered over with tekken netting.

Traps should be placed in open areas away from coconut and other palm trees, to draw rhino beetles away from trees.

Beetle has spread

The control of Guam’s unique rhino beetle population is a conversation that now involves multiple Pacific Island nations after being found in locations beyond the Marianas.

The invasive species, now named CRB-G, was first discovered on Guam on Sept. 11, 2007.

"Almost exactly 11 years ago,” Moore said. “But it’s now been found in Papua New Guinea, Rota, Hawaii and the Solomon Islands.”

Moore and his colleagues last month attended a conference in Australia aimed at finding solutions to the beetle infestation. The unique species, he said, is resistant to all of the virus strains that have been tested so far in an effort to kill it.

“Elsewhere in the Pacific they use a virus, but it doesn’t work on the ones here because it’s genetically different,” Moore said. “We think there may be a virus isolate that evolved alongside the CRB-G. But the problem is we don’t know exactly where it came from. So, we have to go out and search for it, release it into our environment and control the populations here.”

Vigorous invaders

Healthy beetles of the Guam biotype are more vigorous and more successful as invaders being able to survive, transport and establish in new environments, according to Trevor Jackson of AgResearch New Zealand.

“Once established they are extremely damaging and difficult to eradicate or contain," he said.

Green waste could boost rhino beetle population

An outbreak in Palau in the late 1940s resulted in about 50 percent of the coconut palms being killed by beetles throughout the archipelago. All coconut palms were killed off on some of the smaller islands.
Extension agent Roland Quitugua said unless every homeowner on Guam makes an effort to sanitize their properties, the island could see another beetle population boom in about six months.
"If you think things look bad now, wait until six months later," Quitugua said. "Before Typhoon Dolphin, the CRB-G population was steady. Six months later; that's when things really took off, and we're still seeing the effects."
Breeding sites
While green waste in villages is manageable through the use of air curtain burners, which the government has done in the past, the greater threat lies in harder-to-reach areas where dead vegetation can accumulate without interruption.
“These are breeding sites for grubs, which in time will become adults that will go out and attack trees around the island,” Quitugua said. “Our best hope is that we can find a virus to attack the CRB-G in the next year.”
“We need to save our trees,” Moore said.
