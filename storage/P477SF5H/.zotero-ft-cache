Abstract : During the last four years the Oryctes rhinoceros aggregation pheromone has been experimented, packed in different kind of dispensers and used or large scale in the oil palm plantations in Sumatra under a research programme at Marihat with the Indonesian Oil Palm Research Institute. For improving the use of this method and its bioefficacy in the control of the beetles new pherotraps have been designed and tested. Different models are now available in order to increase the trapping capacity of the traps and to reduce the cost, Pitfalltrap pail or pipe model, Parabola system, Vane trap modified model, Superparabola. The performance of these pherotraps with their advantages and disadvantages are presented. The parabola system using empty mineral bootie fixed to a parabolic dish is the cheapiest model and is very easy to put in place in the field, only attached to a pole. The Vane Trap modified and the Superparabola systems, more sophisticated, are highly effective in terms of capture, but due to the cheap cost of the second one, the Superparabola is more advisable. However for collecting the adults well alive in order to be used again for infection with pathogens, the Pitfalltrap models are more practical. With the pheromone the use of additional rotten empty bunches placed in the traps that has a synergetic effect increases the importance of the catches until four times more than with the conventional systems. But to avoid the dessication of the empty bunches it needs to use the equivalent of two to three bunches per trap. Therefore for pitfalltraps it needs pail or pipe of ten gallons capacity. Regarding the material used lasting longer the cost is even cheaper and the results obtained far better. In term of strategies, utilization of pherotraps in replantation on a large scale covering completely a year of planting, instead of individual blocks more heavily affected and recontaminated, gives the possibility to maintain the Oryctes population under critical level. On mature palms also frequently attacked and even destroyed, pherotraps used as a barrier along the blocks with dispensers collected each morning and replaced in the traps in the afternoon, saving half of the product, is the best way to protect the palms. The same strategy is used for reduction of the beetles population in old plantations before replanting. Therefore in function of the needs, importance of the Oryctes population, year of planting affected, decrease of the inoculum before replanting, necessity of keeping alive the adults for infection and release, association of empty bunches with pheromone, cost of the traps, a choice between these different models of pherotraps can be made by the planters along with the strategies to use in order to increase the bioefficacy of the pheromone for a perfect biocontrol of the rhinoceros beetles.
