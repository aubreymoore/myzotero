Figure 1

Circadian and Solar Azimuth Signals

(A) The antennal clock of the monarch.

(A 1 ) Molecular time course curves involved in keeping the circadian rhythm. The per / tim / cry2 (blue/red/green) relative mRNA levels measured in the antennae ( Merlin et al., 2009 ). Antennal circadian clocks coordinate sun compass orientation in migratory monarch butterflies. Science 325, 1700–1704. (Reprinted with permission from AAAS.)

(A 2 ) Signals recorded from the antenna using EAG over 2 days (D1-cyan and D2-magenta; normal L:D [12:12] regime; and freq. >65 Hz). The points in each light segment are fitted with a third order polynomial fit (dashed curves) and globally with a cosine fit (solid blue curve: Math Eq ).

(A 3 ) Firing rate profiles of neurons NCLK1_C (light green; accords with cry2 ), NCLK1 (cyan), NCLK2_C (dark green), and NCLK2 (navy; accords with per / tim ).

(B) “The butterfly eyes”, Graphium cloanthus kuge butterfly eyes reflecting the direction of the light (Credit: Yung Samuel. The Butterfly eyes. http://www.samuelphotos.com ).

(B 1 ) Luminance of rotating light source captured by two hemispheres that model the monarch eyes.

(B 1 ) Luminance captured by left/right hemispheres (top).

(B 1 ) Luminance captured by back/front hemispheres (bottom).

(B 2 ) Firing rate curves of NS1 and NS2 neurons which receptive fields cover the right and the front hemisphere, respectively.

Integration Mechanism for Flight Orientation Control

(A) Fall migration to the SW direction.

(A 1 ) SW measurements (early fall, MA, USA from the United States Naval Observatory) with respect to the solar azimuth (gray). Line approximation Math Eq to these points shown in blue.

(A 2 ) Control requirements for the line-attractor: all points in the plane will converge to the SW.

(A 3 ) Potential (Lyapunov) function Math Eq that determines the direction of the change of the angular position for each point in Math Eq plane. As required, Math Eq everywhere except on the line attractor. Its derivative, Math Eq , points toward the line attractor.

(A 4 ) Input wiring diagram of L and R neurons indicative into which direction to turn. Such wiring produces the function Math Eq , which guarantees a line attractor.

(A 5 ) Angular position of fixed points (stable-black and unstable-cyan), directions of correction of flight (blue-right and red-left), and the angle Math Eq (gray) in the compass view at different times of day (T = 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12).

(B) Schematic indicating spring remigration.

(B 1 ) Reflected integration circuit (NCLK1_C and NCLK2_C replace NCLK1 and NCLK2; sign of connections is flipped) produces a circuit that keeps the NE flight direction (used in spring remigration).

Flight Tracks Simulator

(A) Simulated flight tracks in a compass view (top), with the sun at an angular position according to time of day (here Math Eq ). The butterfly rotates to find the SW. Rotation angle is sampled every 0.3 s and marked by blue dots. The simulated flight tracks projected on the potential function Math Eq are shown (bottom). The black ball marks the current potential. As time progresses, the ball slides on the surface of the potential function toward the fixed point located on the stable line of fixed points (red) without crossing the separatrix line (blue).

(B) Illustration of convergence to the SW from rest and initial angular position 110° to the left of the sun, sampled at t  = 2, 8.5, 11.5, and 25 s. In the morning scenario (top), the initial position falls on the right of the separatrix (cyan bar) and is followed by rightward rotation to the SW (red bar). In the afternoon scenario (bottom), the initial position falls on the left of the separatrix, and followed by leftward rotation to the SW, produces a longer cycle, unlike the morning scenario.

Model Simulated Flight Angle Tracks Compared with Tethered Flight

(A) Convergence to the proper direction in the model and outdoors experiments.

(A 1 ) Mean timescales for convergence to the SW in the model starting at rest from uniformly distributed angular positions (5° bins) computed at different times of day.

(A 2 ) Spatial distribution of convergence timescales at three times of day.

(A 3 ) Spatial distributions in the afternoon Math Eq with shifted L:D cycle by −5 hr or +5 hr; analogous to morning/evening distributions rotated by 90° clockwise/counterclockwise.

(B) Changes of direction (turns/rotations) analyzed from raw data recorded in Guerra et al. (2012 ). See Figure S4 for particular datasets used here.

(B 1 ) Direction changes in flight tracks.

(B 2 ) Spatial distribution of turns. Each turn is marked by a magenta dot or, according to their direction, green: left and red: right. The red and blue radii denote the positions of predicted stable and separatrix fixed points.

(B 3 ) Rotations count.

(B 4 ) Probability for full rotation (within ± 2 s) from uniformly distributed angular positions (6° bins).

(C) Typical flight signatures (10 s duration) within recorded (top) and model (for ZT = 8) (bottom) tracks. In the model, displacement is achieved by perturbing the input force until angular position reaches 300° (small), 15° (large), or 65° (ease-in).

(D) Tracks for long period of flight (10 min) in a radial plot (time is the radius) and statistics of the angle/angular velocity.

(D 1 ) Flight track in the afternoon for a monarch with regular L:D cycle (L is 6 am:6 pm).

(D 2 ) Flight track in the afternoon for a monarch with a shifted L:D cycle by 6 hr backward (L is 12 pm:12 am).
Highlights

    • A model for time-compensated sun compass used by monarch butterflies is developed
    • Neural oscillations encoding solar azimuth and time of day are proposed
    • Special integration of neural oscillations enables correction to southwest flight
    • The model explains flight simulator tracks and supports northeast remigration

Summary

Migrating eastern North American monarch butterflies use a time-compensated sun compass to adjust their flight to the southwest direction. Although the antennal genetic circadian clock and the azimuth of the sun are instrumental for proper function of the compass, it is unclear how these signals are represented on a neuronal level and how they are integrated to produce flight control. To address these questions, we constructed a receptive field model of the compound eye that encodes the solar azimuth. We then derived a neural circuit model that integrates azimuthal and circadian signals to correct flight direction. The model demonstrates an integration mechanism, which produces robust trajectories reaching the southwest regardless of the time of day and includes a configuration for remigration. Comparison of model simulations with flight trajectories of butterflies in a flight simulator shows analogous behaviors and affirms the prediction that midday is the optimal time for migratory flight.
