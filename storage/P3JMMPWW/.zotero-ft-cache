    "What's interesting is that the beetles aren't actually feeding on the tree. They burrow into the tree and infect it with a fungus. Then they eat the fungus." – Aubrey Moore, entomologist, University of Guam

While scientists have confirmed the exact species of bark beetle doing damage to native nanåsu plants in Tumon, the situation is far from "case closed."

"I feel a little better knowing that it's not invasive at least," said entomologist Aubrey Moore. "We still have a few more questions to answer as far as the damage goes."

Samples sent to the University of Florida revealed that the bark beetle belonged to the species hemicryphalus argutus, one of 86,000 beetle species in the curculionidae family.

Earlier this week, environmental officials held an informational briefing at the Guam Visitors Bureau after noticing the dieback of large amounts of nanåsu, which is used as an ornamental hedge throughout Tumon.

Dieback is a condition in which a tree or shrub begins to die from the tip of its leaves or roots backward.

It turns out the beetle may be endemic to the Mariana Islands, evolving here over time.

Almost nothing is known about this species. The only previous record is from specimens collected in Saipan in 1944 and 1945, according to a University of Guam press release.

"What's interesting is that the beetles aren't actually feeding on the tree. They burrow into the tree and infect it with a fungus. Then they eat the fungus," Moore said. "So there's still a lot of questions we haven't answered yet, like 'Are the trees becoming more prone to stress, and why?'"

'One step closer'

One possible reason, Moore said, is that the trees are being planted in unsuitable conditions. He noted that the nanåsu is accustomed to dry soil, limestone and even sand. Plants being infected in Tumon are possibly being subjected to wetter soils and environments, causing stress.

"We don't have an answer for certain yet but we're definitely one step closer," he said.

Moore is holding off on making any recommendations at this point. The beetle itself is smaller than the "A" on a dime, making it extremely difficult to spot.

One thing is for certain, however. Loss of the nanåsu and other beach strand plant species to pests and other environmental stressors would mean disaster for Guam's land – and sea.

"These are plants along the beaches that protect our ecosystem from erosion, and the runoff onto the reef that occurs from that. Everything is interconnected."
