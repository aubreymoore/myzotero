Research in Support of the Guam Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle Eradication Project
Field Cage Experiment Escape Test
Prepared by Aubrey Moore University of Guam Cooperative Extension Service October 9, 2012
None of 56 beetles were able to escape from vaned bucket traps.
1 Introduction
The Guam Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle Eradication project uses standard vaned bicket traps. Observations of beetles taking oﬀ vertially, ’helicoptering’, led us to perform this experiment to conﬁrm that captured beetles are not escaping.
2 Methods
2.1 Beetles
For each experiment, we ﬁeld collected adult coconut rhinoceros beetles, Oryctes rhinoceros. These were housed in two plastic tubs half ﬁlled with peat moss, 30 beetles in each tub. The beetles were fed bananas two days prior to the start of each experiment. Beetles were kept in an air conditioned room when not being used in ﬂight tests.

2.2 Field Cages
Experiments were performed in two custom-designed large ﬁeld cages (20’ x 20’ x 10’) erected at the University of Guam’s Agricultural Experiment Station in Yigo (Fig. 1).
2.3 Flight Tests
On October 5, 2012 at about 30 minutes prior to sunset, about 26 beetles were placed in new vaned bucket trap which were hung on a stand in cages N and 30 beetes were placed in a bucket trap hung in cage S.
Beetles became active and strted buzzing their wings at about 15 minutes after sunset. At about three hours after sunset, beetles were collected, counted and returned to their tubs.
3 Results
All of 26 beetles placed in the bucket in cage N remained in the bucket. Similarly, all of 30 beetles placed in the bucket in cage S remained in the bucket.
