Review of Master’s Thesis Entitled “Investigating the impacts of the natural enemy Trichogramma chilonis Ishii on populations of Crocidolomia pavonana in Samoa” by Philip John Tuivavalagi, University of Queensland
Overall Comments
This is the best Master’s thesis I have ever reviewed. It is well organized and well written, except for the life tables section which needs improvement for clarity.
Specific Comments
Most of the following comments are suggestions rather than required changes.
Note: Page numbers start with page 1 of the pdf file, not page 1 of the thesis.
p. 1 US$780 -> US$780M
p. 1 (CIA 2015) does not have a matching reference. If you are referring to the US Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook, be aware that this is not a very reliable data source. They still list copra as a major crop for Guam even though there has been no copra produced on Guam in the past 50 years. If you want to cite an online source, it is custumary to include th URL and download date in your reference.

p. 23 Furthermore, Trichogramma chilonis Ishii was used against Ostrinia furnacalis eggs in Guam (Nafus & Schreiner, 1986), in India (=Trichogramma confusum) (Nagarkatti &Nagaraja 1978), in Indonesia (=Trichogramma minutum) (Leefmans, 1929; Kalshoven 1981), and in the Philippines (Shibuya & Yamashita 1936).
Does this mean that T. confusum and T. minutum are junior synonyms of T. chilonis? If so, it might bee better to state this explicitely to avoid confusion.

p. 30 Using the data -> Using data
p.37 Interesting that none of your farmers used B.t. Is this because of availability or cost? If the reason is known it might be good to put a sentence or two in the text somewhere to satisfy curious readers.
p. 44 Small formatting problem for first application indicator.

P. 50 Typo in y axes: “appliactions”.
“Mean number of insecticide applications per week throughout the crop cycle (F7,88 = 1.95; P= 0.07) and mean number of active ingredient applications per week (F7,88 = 3.52; P = 0.002) (Field Site-2 and Field Site-8 significantly different) at Field Sites 1-8.”
The above is quite confusing. I suggest something along these lines::
“Mean numbers of insecticide applications per week throughout the crop cycle were not significantly different among fields (F7,88 = 1.95; P= 0.07). Mean numbers of active ingredient applications per week were significantly different among fields (F7,88 = 3.52; P = 0.002) as indicated by different letters above bars.
P. 51 number applications was significantly different between field sites -> numbers of applications were significantly different among fields

“Germinated seedlings were separately transplanted into individual pots (10 cm diameter) containing potting mix.” Is the potting mix the same sand/soil mixture you used for germination, or is this something else? Needs explan ation.

P. 58 This is a nice diagram, but a little confusing. I take it that the only difference should be the length of the nylon mesh screen. However, the ellipses which represent the tops of the exclusion cages are different. They are colored different shades of grey and one has a dotted border. Please fix to avoid confusion.

-----------------------------------------------Data Treatment and Analysis

This section is hard to interpret and needs to be rewritten for clarity. Would be great if the raw data and analysis scripts could be added as “additional material” so that the reader could see exactly how the data were handled.
I suggest something along these lines to explain what data were recorded: -The number of eggs in each egg mass (N) was counted when plants were placed in field cages on day 0. The eggs were counted again when egg masses were removed from the field on day 3 and the number of missing eggs (M) was calculated.
At the end of the incubation period (day ?), we tallied the number of eggs which hatched (H), inferred from the number of first instar caterpillars collected, and the number of eggs parasitized (P), inferred from the number of eggs which turned black. Thus, we enumerated the outcome for all eggs: N = M + H + P
I suggest adding an additional table, similar to Table 3.1, where the raw count data are provided instead of proportions. --
P. 61 Elkington et al. (1992) There is no reference provided for this citation, nor is Elkington 1992 referred to in Furlong 2004b.
The explanation for increasing the estimate for proportion of eggs parasitized by partitioning the missing egg count is a little confusing, partially because of the substitution of “rate” for “proportion”. Stick with “proportion”. These are not really rates. (In my mind, rates use two different units such as miles per hour, whereas you are using only one unit (eggs per egg)).
If you are going to make this adjustment for the estimate of the proportion of eggs parasitized, shouldn’t you also make the same adjustment for the estimate of the proportion of eggs which hatched?
P. 62 Please use “proportion” instead of “rate”
P. 63 Table 3.1: It is not clear to me if the “Mortality” column includes death by parasitism.
P. 64 I realize that you are using the classical life table format, but I think you still need to provide a definition for lx, dx, qx. Perhaps you did, but the end of the table is cut off in my copy.

P. 64 It appears that the table is cut off at the bottom.
