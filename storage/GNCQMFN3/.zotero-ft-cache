Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros)
Agnes Vargo, Instructor of Entomology, American Samoa Community College

T he female coconut rhinoceros

beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros

[L.])

(Coleoptera:

Scarabaeidae) burrows into

rotting stumps, standing

palms and rubbish piles to lay

her eggs. The eggs hatch in

8–12 days into whitish grubs,

called curl grubs because of

their shape. There are four

larval stages lasting 12–165

days and a pupal period last- Adult rhinoceros beetle

ing three to four months.

Adults may live up to six months, during which time

a female can lay up to 100 eggs.

The adults are the damaging stage of this insect.

They fly at night and feed by tunnelling into the

young coconut leaves. This damage causes a typical

V-shaped notch. If they reach the growing tip, the

palm may be killed or severe loss of leaf tissue may

cause decreased nut set.

The beetles attack many species of palms includ-

ing coconut, betel nut, sago palm and dates. They

can also feed on pandanus and other fleshy plants.

This beetle is present in American Samoa and

Palau, as well as S.E. Asia and many other islands

in the Pacific and Indian Ocean.

Control Field sanitation is important in controlling the beetle. Standing coconut logs, stumps and rubbish piles should be cleared away. If this is not practical, a ground cover such as Pueraria phaseoloides may be used to cover these locations so that the females cannot reach them. Coconut plantations should be replanted when they become too old to maintain an even stand because the beetles prefer isolated trees

or trees of irregular height. A virus that attacks the larvae and adults has been highly successful in reducing beetle populations in the South Pacific region and is present in American Samoa and in Palau.
