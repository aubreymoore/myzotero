Pests in Brief
In this issue. Our newsletter has featured Panama disease (tropical race 4) and huanglongbing (citrus greening) in past issues. These diseases have recently reached the Pacific Islands, however, so we are updating them for your information. This newest, most severe race of Panama disease, TR4, was found on a banana plantation in Queensland, Australia, in March 2015; a second outbreak was reported in April. Its hosts include both cooking bananas and dessert bananas. The second disease, huanglongbing, was reported on Guam in February 2015. It is a threat to any type of citrus and to orange jasmine (Murraya paniculata), grown on some islands as a hedge or ornamental plant.

A jump on biocontrol. California, the second larg-

est citrus producer in the U.S., is making strides to

protect itself against huanglongbing (citrus green-

ing disease). In December 2014, Diaphorencyrtus

aligarhensis (photo)

was released to fight

the Asian citrus

psyllid, the insect

that carries the

citrus greening dis-

ease bacterium. It is

the second parasitoid to be released

by the state in three

years; Tamarixia radiata was released in 2011. Both

species have been used against the psyllid in other

countries. Tamarixia radiata was successful at

suppressing the psyllid in places like Guadeloupe,

the Carribbean, and Reunion Island. Interestingly,

Hawaii discovered both parasitoid species attacking

the Asian citrus psyllid on Oahu Island in 2012.

Panama Disease Tropical Race 4

(A) Symptoms of Panama disease (Fusarium wilt) are first seen as a yellowing at the edges of older leaves (white arrow), followed by collapse of the petioles (red arrows). (B) Collapsed leaves eventually form a skirt of brown, dry leaves around the pseudostem (red arrows). In this photo, the leaves in front of the pseudostem have been removed so the diagnostic splitting of its base is visible (white arrow).

Origin, Distribution. Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense tropical race 4 (TR4) probably originated in Sumatra and peninsular Malaysia. It is now found in Indonesia, China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Mozambique, and Jordan. The disease was reported during the past year in Lebanon and Pakistan and from Queensland, Australia, in March 2015. TR4 devastated the banana industry in the Northern Territory of Australia in the late 1990s, but is currently limited to one Queensland plantation.

Likely Locations. Anywhere in the tropics where bananas are grown. Panama disease is caused by a soilborne fungus. Once it enters an area, it can travel to other locations in soil, irrigation or rainwater, on contaminated equipment, and in infected rhizomes and suckers. Young suckers do not show symptoms of the disease until they are about four months old.

Discoloration of the vascular system of plants infected with Panama disease, also called Fusarium wilt. (A) The vessels are pale yellow to light brown early in the disease, (B) then turn dark red to brownish black. The fungus can live in the soil for many years and enters plants through the feeder roots. As it moves up into the corm and pseudostem, it blocks the water-conducting cells of the plant and causes it to wilt.

Hosts. Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense race 1 affects ‘Gros Michel’ (AAA) and ‘Lady Finger’ (AAB). Race 2 attacks cooking bananas (ABB) like ‘Bluggoe.’ Tropical race 4 devastates Cavendish (AAA) cultivars as well as all the banana varieties susceptible to race 1 and race 2. Race 3 only attacks Heliconia species.
Impact. Panama disease was first reported in Australia in 1876. Its greatest impact, however, was in Central America between 1940 and 1960. Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense race 1 destroyed the susceptible ‘Gros Michel’ bananas causing losses of around $400 million (about $2.3 billion today). World trade then switched to resistant cultivars of the Cavendish group, such as ‘Williams.’ Cavendish bananas, however, are not resistant to tropical race 4. This race of the fungus is a threat to the multibillion dollar global trade in bananas. It also threatens the food security of the millions of subsistence farmers, who grow about 85% of all bananas harvested worldwide.

(A) This orange tree, severely affected with citrus greening, is stunted, with twig dieback, poor flowering and few fruits. (B) Branch with typical mottled leaves and ripe oranges that are still partially green. (C, D) Blotchy, uneven leaf mottling is a typical symptom of huanglongbing (HLB). Unlike nutrient disorders, discoloration on the left side of the leaf differs from the right side and yellowing is not present on the underside of the leaf .

Origin & Distribution. First reported in China in 1943, it is now present in countries throughout the world. The first to report HLB in the American Affiliated Pacific Islands was Guam in early 2015.
Hosts. Most Citrus species, plus orange jasmine (Murraya paniculata), box orange (Severinia buxifolia), and several other species in the family Rutaceae. Some weeds are also hosts of HLB; limeberry (Triphasia trifoliata) is widespread on Guam, making eradication of the bacterium almost impossible.

(A) Fruits on diseased trees are often misshaped or small, green, and bitter. (B) Aborted seeds are usually small and discolored. (C) The Asian citrus psyllid transmits the HLB bacterium. The adult is 3 to 4 mm long and feeds with its body at an angle. (D) Waxy strands produced by the nymphs are diagnostic for the psyllid.

Psyllid vector. The Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri) is present in Hawaii, American Samoa. and Guam. Look for mottled brown adults feeding at an angle (photo C) on stems and undersides of leaves; they are quick, jumping insects. Nymphs: five instars, yellow orange, 0.25 to 1.5 mm, excrete wax (photo D). Impact. Major threat to sustainable citrus production worldwide with yield losses of 30 to 100% in Africa; cost to fight HLB in Sao Paulo, Brazil (2009) $33.4 million, and more than 60 million trees destroyed globally since the early 1990s. In the five years following the introduction of HLB (20062011), Florida estimated an economic loss of >$4.5 billion and more than 8,000 full-time jobs.
