Introduction Oryctes rhinoceros, commonly known as the coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), is large invasive scarab beetle native to Southeast Asia. CRB is a major pest of coconut palm trees (Figure 1) in its expanded range which includes tropical islands in the Pacific, and most recently the island of Oahu in the Hawaiian archipelago. For decades, a double-stranded DNA virus, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV; family Nudiviridae, genus Alphanudivirus), has been an effective biological control agent reducing the impact of CRB in its native and expanded range (1). In recent years, a new, genetically distinct biotype of CRB (Guam genotype) has emerged that appears to be resistant to OrNV (2).

Results The presence of OrNV was evaluated for 190 CRB specimens collected from 9 locations in the Pacific region. Virus incidences ranged from 0% (Guam and Oahu) to 100% (China, Japan, and Vietnam) (Figure 2, Table 2).

Objectives 1. Determine the OrNV status of CRB specimens collected
from Hawaii and elsewhere in the Pacific region 2. Examine the genetic diversity of OrNV isolates 3. Determine the genotype (Guam or Non-Guam) of these
CRB specimens

Materials and Methods Sample collection: CRB specimens were collected from American Samoa, China, Guam, Japan, Hawaii (Oahu), Palau, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. GPS coordinates and locations were recorded when available. DNA extraction: DNA was extracted from CRB tissues using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. OrNV detection: Five primer sets (Table 1) were used for detecting OrNV using GoTaq® Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI USA) and the following PCR parameters: 95oC for 3min; 35 cycles of 95oC for 30s, 50oC for 60s, 72oC for 1min; 72oC for 5min. PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. OrNV genetic diversity: Select OrNV PCR products were cloned into pGEM®-T Easy (Promega) and sequenced. Sequences were aligned and phylogenetic trees were created using Clustal W v2.0 (3). Genetic diversity metrics were generated used DnaSP 5.10.1 (4). CRB genotyping: A PCR-RFLP assay using primers targeting the cytochrome oxidase I gene of CRB (Table 1) and Mse I was used to discriminate Guam from Non-Guam CRB genotypes (5).

All locations sampled had only one CRB genotype present, except for Palau which harbored both Guam and Non-Guam genotypes (Figure 2, Table 3). OrNV was primarily found in Non-Guam genotype CRB, but was also detected in CRB collected from Palau, Japan, and Taiwan that were the Guam genotype.

Figure 3. Unrooted neighborjoining tree using the glycoprotein gene of select OrNV isolates from the Pacific region. The Malaysia isolate sequence is from GenBank (Accession EU747721.1).

The glycoprotein gene of OrNV was found to have limited genetic diversity, with all isolates sharing >98% nucleotide identity for this sequence. Preliminary phylogenetic analysis indicated some geographic relationship to these sequences, with distinct clades for Palau and American Samoa (Figure 3).
Conclusions and Future Work 1. OrNV is absent in Guam, despite numerous attempts at establishment as a
biological control agent of CRB; OrNV is also absent in Oahu’s incipient CRB population, although there have been no attempts at establishment. 2. OrNV can infect the Guam genotype of CRB in certain geographic locations. 3. OrNV has limited genetic diversity in the glycoprotein gene. Examination of the genetic diversity of other OrNV genes listed in Table 1 is underway.
