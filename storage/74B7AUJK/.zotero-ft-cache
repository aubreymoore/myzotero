Roland Quitugua, Guam Invasive Species Council member who is a board member of the Guam Northern Soil and Water Conservation District, says government agencies should work together to make sure invasive species don't cause further harm to Guam. John I. Borja/PDN

The Guam Invasive Species Council now has a Green Waste Ad Hoc Committee to move a step further in the effort to tackle Guam’s unwanted residents.

The council met Wednesday at Adelup to provide agency reports and progress on invasive species management.

Russell Campbell, chief of the Guam Department of Agriculture's Biosecurity Division, said there hasn't been a central entity in the government of community that focuses on the management of green waste. The invasive coconut rhinoceros beetle is one species that breeds in rotting vegetation.

"It's a disaster waiting to happen from an invasive species standpoint," Campbell said.

Department of Public Works employees Justin Santos, left, and Franklin Calvo Jr., search for signs of coconut rhinoceros beetle infestation in agricultural green waste piled at the site of the old Guam Memorial Hospital in Tamuning on Friday, Oct. 2, 2015. The green waste being stored at the site is a result of material collected after the passage of Typhoon Dolphin in May, said Glenn Leon Guerrero, DPW director.   (Photo: Rick Cruz/PDN)

Green waste includes dead trees or trees that are being cut down or trimmed. If not maintained, the piles end up as breeding sites for many invasive species, Campbell said. Moving these piles with the invasive species in tow could unintentionally spread them throughout the island, he added.

University of Guam entomologist Aubrey Moore has said tree damage caused by Typhoon Dolphin in 2015 resulted in more breeding sites for coconut rhinoceros beetles.

The Green Waste Ad Hoc Committee is tasked with drafting a comprehensive green waste management plan to prevent the further spread of these species. A proposed list of members for the committee includes representatives from the Department of Agriculture, Guam Environmental Protection Agency, utility agencies and the Navy.

Roland Quitugua, board member of the Northern Guam Soil and Water Conservation District, said while the various agencies have their mandates when it comes to invasive species, there are gaps between the entities that need to be accounted for — including green waste management. 

The council voted Quitugua to take the lead in the committee.

Inspection facility

The Guam Customs and Quarantine Agency has plans to build an inspection facility to screen, monitor and clean incoming containers to keep unwanted species out.

The agency plans to install a wash-down system, a recapturing protocol, and if possible, fumigation capabilities for shipping containers that are stored there.

The agency had plans to build the facility in Tiyan, but Thomas Hertslet, representing the Guam Chamber of Commerce, said it would make more sense to build the inspection facility within Guam’s port.

Guam Customs said there is a space requirement that needs to be taken into consideration because the agency is looking at a facility that has three levels and covers six to 10 acres of land.

The council recommended that Customs and the Port Authority of Guam work together to figure out the best suitable place to construct the inspection facility.
