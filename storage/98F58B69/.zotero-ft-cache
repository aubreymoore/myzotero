Here's how to get tons of info from GBIF.

Check out the Species API .

First step is to locate the taxon in the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy. The GBIF Backbone Taxonomy, often called the Nub taxonomy, is a single synthetic management classification with the goal of covering all names GBIF is dealing with.

You can search GBIF manually by going to http://www.gbif.org/species and entering a scientific name or common name. The magic number you are looking for is the GBIF ID .

Alternatively, you can use the Species API: http://api.gbif.org/v1/species/search?q=lawn%20armyworm&rank=SPECIES . This will return info encoded as JSON. The magic number in this case is nubKey .

Once we have the GBIF ID, which is 5109848 for Spodoptera mauritia , we can harvest more data:
	
Name usage: 	http://api.gbif.org/v1/species/5109848
Synonyms: 	http://api.gbif.org/v1/species/5109848/synonyms
