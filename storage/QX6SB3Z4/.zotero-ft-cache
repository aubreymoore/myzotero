As the Festival of Pacific Arts gets closer, more and more materials will come to Guam and, with that, a possibility of invasive species.

A recent shipment of cut nipa leaves from the Philippines had active blue flies, a release from Guam Customs and Quarantine Agency Public Information Officer Jessi Santos stated. The nipa leaves are being used for FestPac. Some of the leaves are on the concrete huts being built at Paseo.

The container had a certificate stating it was fumigated before leaving the Philippines, but officers inspecting it found the blue flies, the release states. The officers took a specimen and resealed the container so the flies couldn’t get out.

The specimen was given to University of Guam entomologist Aubrey Moore, who identifies intercepted pests for Guam, but he was unable to identify it. The specimen was sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Systematic Entomology Laboratory in Washington, D.C., as part of protocol for foreign shipments.

Container treated

On March 7, it was identified as Physiphora clausa in the family of Ulidiidae, or the blue fly. USDA considers the species a “non-actionable pest” because it’s not known to have any economic damage, the release states.

Although the USDA deems the flies “non-actionable,” local authorities determined another treatment was necessary for the container in case there were other pests in the nipa leaves.

Patrick Artero, acting chief of the Guam Department of Agriculture Biosecurity Division, gave the consignee the option to either export it back to its origin, destroy or treat it. The consignee agreed to treat, the release stated.

The container went through two types of fumigant treatment after the first treatment didn’t pass re-inspection.

Leaves released

On March 17, the container was released to the consignee after Customs officers did a third inspection to ensure it was free of any live pests or invasive species which could negatively impact Guam’s agriculture or natural resources, the release stated.

Santos said Guam Customs follows protocols to ensure invasive species aren’t brought into Guam. As FestPac gets closer, more countries will be wanting to bring in natural goods for the event and various agencies are working to ensure compliance, she said.
