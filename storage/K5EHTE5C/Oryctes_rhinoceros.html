<p><em>Oryctes rhinoceros</em> (L.), the coconut rhinoceros beetle,  is a pest species occurring throughout many tropical regions of the world.  Adults can cause extensive damage to economically important wild and plantation  palms.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><em>Oryctes  rhinoceros</em> is  one of the most damaging insects to palms in Asia and the Pacific Islands. Adults  eat the leaves and burrow into the crown, stunting plant development  (Giblin-Davis 2001).</p>
<h3><a name="dist" id="dist">Distribution </a><a href="#top" class="backtop">(Back to Top)</a></h3>
<p><em>Oryctes rhinoceros</em> is native to Asia, between India and Indonesia. It has since  spread to Yemen, Reunion, and Hawaii. Throughout this distribution, the coconut  rhinoceros beetle is most closely associated with its preferred host plant, <em>Cocos </em><em>nucifera</em> L., the coconut palm  (Hinckley 1973).</p>

<h3><a name="desc" id="desc">Description </a><a href="#top" class="backtop">(Back to Top)</a></h3>
<p>Although <em>Oryctes  rhinoceros</em> is found in several regions of the world, its shape, size  and color are generally consistent (Manjeri et al. 2013). Adult beetles range from  1.2 to 2.5 inches in length (3.0 to 6.3 cm) and are dark brown or black. The ventral  surface (underside) of males and females has reddish-brown hairs, but the  female has a fuzzy grouping of these hairs at the tip of the abdomen. Both males and females possess a similarly sized horn used for leverage  when moving within tightly-packed leaves or within the cavities they create in  the crown of palms, the horn length is longer on average for males  (Doane 1913).</p>

</blockquote>
<p><em>Oryctes rhinoceros</em> larvae (grubs) are milky white  with red heads. The body is C-shaped, has three pairs of segmented legs, and is  grayish posteriorly. Over the course of three instars, or phases between molts,  they grow to 4.0 inches long (10.0 cm).</p>

<h3><a name="bio" id="bio">Biology </a><a href="#top" class="backtop">(Back to Top)</a></h3>
<p>Adult females deposit eggs inside dead palms, decaying plant  material, soil with high organic matter content, and, occasionally, wooden  structures (Manjeri et al. 2014). In approximately 11 days, eggs hatch into  larvae which begin feeding on surrounding organic material. Eleven to 15 weeks  later, the larvae will have grown up to 16 times larger and have stopped eating,  after which they enter the pupal stage and are immobile for approximately six  weeks (Hickley 1973). Upon emerging, adults fly to a new tree, feed, and mate,  sometimes mating just after their first feeding. Adults spend most of their  time feeding on fresh leaves. Adult females live up to nine months, over which  period they can lay up to 100 eggs. Thus adult progeny may be present with the  mother and the population consists of overlapping generations (Manjeri et al.  2014).</p>
<p>Multiple overlapping  generations are common under favorable conditions, e.g. when no diapause is  needed. Since coconuts occur in regions where there is no cold season and a minimal dry season, the beetles can be active and reproductive throughout the year.</p>

<h3><a name="host" id="host">Host Plants </a><a href="#top" class="backtop">(Back to Top)</a></h3>
<p>As with many beetles, adults and larvae have different  feeding preferences. In the case of <em>Oryctes rhinoceros</em>, damage to plants  is caused by adults (especially young adults) and not larvae, which feed on  already rotting material (Giblin-Davis 2001).</p>
<p>Larvae live in decaying material including: <em>Cocos nucifera</em>, <em>Artocarpus </em>sp. (breadfruit), <em>Calophyllum inophyllum</em> (Alexandrian  laurel), <em>Mangifera </em>sp. (mango),  and <em>Pandanus</em> sp. (Gressitt 1953).</p>
<p>Adults are a major pest of <em>Cocos nucifera</em> (coconut palm) and <em>Elaeis  guineensis</em> (African oil palm) (Giblin-Davis 2001) but are a minor pest of many  other palms and plant species. By feeding on healthy leaves, <em>Oryctes rhinoceros</em> causes physical  damage, which can stunt growth and lead to secondary infections from bacteria or  fungi (Hinckley 1973).</p>

<h3><a name="econ" id="econ">Economic Importance </a><a href="#top" class="backtop">(Back to Top)</a></h3>
<p><strong>Malaysia:</strong> Adult <em>Oryctes rhinoceros</em> cut through leaves and bore holes into palm crowns. Damage is exacerbated by the tendency of beetles to aggregate. Production loss in plantations in Malaysia has averaged 40%, but has reached 92% (Manjeri et al. 2013).</p>
<p><strong>Paulau:</strong> <em>Oryctes rhinoceros</em> was found in Palau in 1942 and caused an overall tree mortality of 50% (Gressitt 1953). </p>
<p><strong>Guam and Hawaii:</strong> In 2007 <em>Oryctes rhinoceros</em> was declared established in Guam. As of 2012, the coconut palm was Guam's second most abundant tree (Moore 2012). Moore (2007) had previously concluded that "accidental transport of other scarab beetles from Guam to Hawaii is well documented." In 2013, the coconut rhinoceros beetle was found in Hawaii (Hara 2014).</p>
<p><strong>North America:</strong> Coconut rhinoceros beetle is not established in the mainland  United States; however, the risk of accidental transport remains in our  increasingly connected world. If you suspect that you have found this beetle, immediately  contact your local state agency. In Florida, contact the <a href="http://www.freshfromflorida.com/Contact/">Florida  Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services</a> 1-800-HELP-FLA (1-800-436-7352).</p>
<h3><a name="mgmt" id="mgmt">Management and Control </a><a href="#top" class="backtop">(Back to Top)</a></h3>
<p>Detection can be difficult due to the beetle’s nocturnal  activity and residence within trees. Visual signs such as holes bored at the  base of leaves and V-shaped feeding damage help locate this beetle. Recently, acoustic  detection was used to find <em>Oryctes rhinoceros</em> in live and dead palms on  Guam (Mankin and Moore 2010). Once detected, management and control are required  to mitigate the economic impact of a beetle infestation.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Control:</strong> Historical control of scarab beetle pests  has included chemical and biopesticides, biological control (predators,  parasitoids, and pathogens), and trapping with lures (Jackson and Klein 2006).  Traps for the coconut rhinoceros beetle contain 4-methyloctanoate, an  aggregation pheromone produced by the male beetle. In breeding sites, the fungus <em>Metarhizium anisopliae</em> may be applied  for larval control and is distributed by adults. This fungus acts as a  biopesticide on immature stages of the beetle (Bedford (2014).</p>
<p>Viruses in the genus <em>Nudivirus</em> have also been associated with <em>Oryctes  rhinoceros</em> and may play a role in controlling the beetle in regions where  they are invasive (Bedford 2014). Infection by <em>Oryctes rhinoceros </em>nudivirusdeforms  and may kill larvae, and hinders oviposition by females (Bedford 2014).  However, the nudivirus may harm other species and genera of scarabs. In Korea, farmers  of <em>Allomyrina dichotoma</em> (Japanese  rhinoceros beetle) face a potential disaster if the nudivirus were to infect  their populations, which consist of hundreds of larvae grown together in large  plastic containers. These beetles are cultivated for sale as pets and to be  used in gambling. The result of a Korean study in which <em>Allomyrina dichotoma</em> larvae were infected with the nudivirus was that  60% died in six weeks. There is also concern that the nudivirus may be  transmitted to wild populations of <em>Allomyrina  dichotoma</em>. There is no clear indication that the <em>Oryctes rhinoceros </em>nudivirus is the major pathogen responsible for  losses of <em>Allomyrina dichotoma</em> in  Korea and tests are ongoing (Lee et al. 2015).</p>
<p><strong>Management:</strong> Managing the coconut rhinoceros  beetle involves removing or destroying organic material that supports larval  development such as decaying logs and stumps, removing dead palms, and removing  piles of leaves and grass (Schmaedick 2005). A study on burning the downed and  decomposing trunks of oil palms has shown that only partial burning of sites is  ineffective in managing population levels of <em>Oryctes rhinoceros</em> (Abidin et al. 2014).</p>
