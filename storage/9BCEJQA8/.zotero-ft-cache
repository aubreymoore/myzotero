UOG entomologists identiﬁed the wasp as Vespa tropica based on publicly available images and keys [Archer, 1991]. This is a medium-sized to large species. Queens reach 30mm or more, males average 26mm and workers average 24 to 26mm.
This species is known to attack the nests of Polistines (paper wasps) in order to obtain the larvae to feed their own larvae. It is said to be almost exclusive in choice of prey. However, they sometimes catch honeybees
The nest of Vespa tropica is usually underground or in a tree hollow or similar enclosed space. Due to the location, the nest is seldom seen. If excavated, the nest usually appears rhomboid or bowl-shaped, with an open bottom (as opposed to the completely sealed nests of most aerial hornets). The nest envelope is laminar (comprising of distinct, broad individual layers) and very brittle.

On July 12, 2016, University of Guam research assistant Christopher Rosario discovered a colony of large wasps nesting in a hollow avocado tree in Dededo, Guam (13.50533 °N, 144.80134 °E). The wasps were aggressive, resulting in only single specimen being collected. This observation was posted on the iNaturalist web site (http://www.inaturalist.org/observations/3663868).
On July 20, 2016, Arnold Perez of the Leo Palace Resort delivered 5 specimens of Vespa tropica to Dr. Aubrey Moore at the University of Guam. Perez discovered
