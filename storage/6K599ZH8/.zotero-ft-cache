One of three containers of nipa palm leaves imported from the Philippines for the 12th Festival of Pacific Arts was fumigated on March 1 after Guam Customs and Quarantine Agency officers discovered blue flies inside.

Despite a phytosanitary certificate indicating the container with more than 11,330 pounds of cut nipa leaves from the Philippines was fumigated before it arrived in Guam, customs officers observed blue flies inside the container. One of the flies was put in a vial and sent to an entomologist at the University of Guam.

Entomologist Aubrey Moore, unable to identify the species, had the specimen sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Systematic Entomology Laboratory in Washington, D.C., as per protocol for incoming foreign shipments, according to a customs statement. The flies were found to be Physiphora clausa species flies of the Ulidiidae family.

The container was resealed to prevent any of the flies from escaping after the initial specimen was sent to UOG.

The USDA determined the fly did not require specific mitigation measures and was determined a “non-actionable” pest. Nonetheless, customs officials decided treatment of the container was necessary before the container could be released, as other pests might be hiding among the leaves.

Option

Patrick Artero, the Department of Agriculture’s acting chief of the biosecurity division, informed the importer that they had the option of sending the leaves back, destroying them or treating them. The importer, at its own expense, chose to treat the container. The container was fumigated twice with two different fumigants, one Vikane and another methyl bromide.

The Vikane did not work, so officials turned to methyl bromide, according to a statement.

The container was eventually released to the importer after GCQA conducted a third inspection and ensured it was free of live pests or invasive species.

The nipa palm leaves were imported for FestPac décor. FestPac logistics committee Chairman Jay Rojas said the leaves will be used to cover concrete festival village huts, the canoe house, the vendor structures and for temporary hospitality section huts at Paseo. The leaves will also be used to dress the 60-foot by 40-foot main stage to be built in the Paseo stadium, Rojas said.

Rojas said no other leaves or similar flora will be imported for FestPac. Items like coconut husks, coconut leaves, bamboo stalks or flowers are being collected now. “That’s all stuff we will be getting locally because we have that on island,” he said.

The Paseo grounds will undergo a “full transformation” to invoke a traditional cultural island motif for FestPac, according to Rojas. The short bollard posts lining Paseo sidewalks will be covered with coconut husks and bamboo to complement other thatched roofs and traditional decorations planned for the festival hub.

A biosecurity plan is in place for the festival, according to Rojas. “We know all this stuff is coming in for the festival. We’re prepared for it, we’ve got the team ready,” he said. Some visiting delegations, like that of New Zealand, may also ship their items to Guam ahead of the festival. The delegations have been asked what they are bringing so customs officers know what to look for when it arrives, according to Rojas.

Items from the delegations are to be screened in their respective island nations or territories and then will also be inspected upon arrival in Guam.
