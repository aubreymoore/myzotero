TEMPERATURE "C

Iil order to learn whether the behavior of test insects was actually in response to the heat gradient rather than some tendency to remain near the center oi the test chamber, 10 beetles were tested as previously tlescrikd, but without ice or heat being added so that the temperature remained uniform throughout the length of the gradient. The results revealed random movements over the entire
length of the test chamber, with a tendency for the insects to aggreg-ate near the ends.

Upper letl~alternl~eratureexperiments were run in an electrically heated, ther~nostatically controlletl temperature cabinet in which ~ a r i a t i o t idid not exceed 2 1 " C for a particular setting. For each temperature tested, 10 insects were placed in a battery jar and Icept in the cabinet for one hour. The upper lethal temperature was taken to be that at which 80-100% o i the test insects were killed. All insects were kept at room temperature (13-28" C ) for at least one month prior to being tested. I-ow humidity prevailed in these tests, although it doubtlessly varied
sorne\vhat. No attempt was made to determine the effect of different hu:nidity levels on the upper lethal temperature.
In the first series oi tests, 10 beetles Lvere exposed to a temperature of 40" C for one hour. The procedure was then repeated, using 10 new insects, at 41" C, and so forth, until a temperature \vas reached that killed 100% of the test insects. After exposure of each group, the insects were observed and placed in containers of rotting wood to be observed again after 21 and 48 hours. Beetles were consitlered dead when mouth parts, antennae and legs failed to respond to extensive probing. The results of these tests are sho\\n in Table 11.

P.disjrritctzis \\.ill select a preierred temperature range
if given a wide series oi temperatures irom which to choose. Insects kept a t lo\v temperatures selected a lower range than those kept at intermediate or high tetnperatures: those kept at higher temperatures preferred a higher range than those kept at intermediate or low teniperatures. \\:hereas the preferred temperature range is ~ ~ s u a l ldyefined as a zone selected by 50-8070 oi tlie tested

indi\iduals, in the present atutly, the preierred range is
expressed a s ). Is, which includes approximately 6870
of the autoselected temperature preierences. The xalue of 6870 is one oi convenience and has no special physiological significance.
The findings indicate that regardless oi previous temperature history, the mean selected temperature shows a tendency to decrease progressively during the course of a 6-hour exposure period (Figure 1 ) . Because of this tendency, any statement of mean selected temperature or preierred range should be accompanied by a statement oi duration of exposure if it is to be useful in comparative analyses. This apparent change in the preierendum was interpreted as a possible response to lower humidities at the cold end of the test chamber. Gunn and Cosway (1938) explained a similar shift to lower temperatures, and hence to a higher humidity, as an effort to avoid desiccatio~l,initiated by critical reduction in water content oi the insect's body.
The effect of length oi exposure upon tlie upper lethal temperature is well demonstrated it1 the experimental findings. Whereas a one hour exposure to 45 I l o C is lethal to nearly all test insects, only 38 1" C is lethal to most for a 12-hour exposure. According to llellanby (1938), the difference is due to the increased role of desiccation as a contributing lethal factor in longer exposures. Humidity was not controlled in these experiments although low humidities prevailed in the temperature cabinet used. The upper lethals for both 1 and 12 hours oi exposure approximate similar values reported ior other temperate zone Coleoptera, but fall considerably short of those reported for rnost weevils (Spector 1956).
\\'hen Betsy beetles were placed in a temperature gradient, they selected a temperature range, the nature of which depended upon past temperature history. A progressive decrease in preierendum, apparently in response to effects oi desiccation, poi11ts out the necessity for accompanying preferendum data mith a statement of exposure length. The upper lethal ten~peraturefor one hour exposure was approximately 45" C , that for 12 hours exposure was approximately 39' C. Temperature char-
acteristics of P. n'isjr!i~ctns do not differ greatly irom
those reported for most other temperate zone beetles.
