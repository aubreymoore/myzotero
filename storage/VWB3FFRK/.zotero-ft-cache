Foreword

This publication has been produced to conveniently combine related documents on invasive species in the Pacific islands for ease of reference. The publication contains a series of technical reviews of land and freshwater invasive species, non-technical summary of the same together with an account of legislation about invasive species, and the pathways by which these species gain access to countries. Also included is a draft regional strategy for invasive species.
The invasive species reviews were based on desk research using available literature and personal communications. Inevitably there will be omissions in the reviews, but at least they may serve as a start for national managers and policy makers in their decisionmaking. The scope of the reviews and the process leading to the creation of the draft regional strategy were planned in collaboration with the IUCN Invasive Species Specialist Group and noted regional experts in invasive species.
After the technical reviews had been completed, they were summarised in a paper (including sections on legislation and ‘pathways’) which was circulated to SPREP member countries together with an invitation to participate in a workshop to draft a regional strategy to mitigate the threat from invasive species. This draft strategy is here presented verbatim from the workshop (except for format editing and the correction of some typographical errors).
The draft strategy also meets SPREP’s obligations to its governing body—the SPREP Meeting—during its tenth meeting in Apia, 1998, which required the Regional Invasive Species Programme (RISP) to produce a Regional Invasive Species Strategy (RISS) through a regional workshop. The draft strategy will be submitted to the 11th SPREP Meeting in Guam,

2000, for endorsement. Thus the RISS will serve as a tool for guiding the RISP and SPREP member countries who wish to use it in deciding priorities for in-country projects. The scope of the technical reviews has been limited to the South Pacific, including the territorial waters of the 22 Pacific SPREP member countries and territories. However, the delegates to the strategy workshop felt that the strategy was relevant to all Pacific islands and its usefulness should not be considered restricted to only the South Pacific.
The review and draft strategy were restricted to terrestrial invasive species and freshwater habitats, and to those invasive species which pose threats to conservation values of native species and their habitats. This is because invasive species in other habitats (such as the ocean) have been largely catered for in the PACPOL Strategy and Workplan (produced by SPREP’s Pacific Ocean Pollution Prevention Programme). Also, invasive species which threaten human health and agriculture, and other economic interests, have already received extensive funding and mention in technical reports. By contrast, invasive species which threaten native species and their habitats have historically received little attention or funding. Thus the focus of these technical reviews and the RISS is on the issue of invasive species with respect to the conservation of terrestrial and freshwater native species and their habitats.
The programmes which paid the consultants who undertook the technical reviews of invasive species in the South Pacific, the workshop which generated the Draft Regional Invasive Species Strategy, and the position of Programme Officer Avifauna Conservation and Invasive Species, were funded by the Governments of New Zealand and Australia.

1. Introduction
Pacific island countries are particularly vulnerable to the effects of invasive species. After habitat destruction or modification, invasive species are responsible for more species extinctions than any other cause. Further, the rate of extinction of native species has been higher on islands than anywhere else in the world. Invasive species have also degraded native ecosystems.
Mitigation of the effects of invasive species on biodiversity is best coordinated regionally. In response to this need, the New Zealand government funded an Invasive Species Programme to be managed by SPREP for three years, starting from September 1998, with the intention of extending funding for another three years after 2001. One of the objectives of this programme (agreed to by SPREP member countries during the SPREP Meeting in 1998) was to develop a strategy for invasive species for use by all countries and relevant agencies in the region. Thus this strategy is intended for use until 2004.
To facilitate the production of the strategy, a regional workshop was held 26 September–1 October 1999 in Nadi, Fiji, funded mainly by AusAID, with some extra support from the United States Government. It aimed to draw together the pressing invasive species issues being experienced in South Pacific countries and to derive strategic solutions.
All SPREP member countries and territories and nongovernment organisations working in the Pacific and with a known interest in invasive species were invited to send a delegate to the regional workshop. Prior to the workshop, several technical reviews were commissioned to describe the status of terrestrial and freshwater invasive species in the South Pacific. The reviews, which were restricted to those invasive species threatening the conservation of native species and natural ecosystems, were compiled into a summary issues and options paper, which was circulated to all workshop delegates and appears in this publication.

The workshop restricted itself to invasive species issues related to conservation of native biodiversity on land and freshwater habitats, to the SPREP member countries, and to the development of strategic responses. The strategy has been produced exactly as written by the workshop except for some formatting and editing of this section and the acknowledgements.
The strategy will be used immediately for implementing the Regional Invasive Species Programme (and other programmes administered by SPREP). It will also be useful for other invasive species initiatives in the Pacific region, or indeed, for other regions in the world, especially those mainly composed of islands.
2. Invasive species issues in the Pacific
The following is a summary of the generic issues underpinning the invasive species problems in the Pacific region. They are described in greater detail in Annex 1. Fundamental to these problems in the Pacific island countries is the shortage and inaccessibility of scientific information on basic biology for assessment of risks and management of invasive species. A related problem is the lack of awareness on the impacts of invasive species on biodiversity. There are insufficient networking mechanisms established for the dissemination of information to the relevant decision-makers and government officials. Coordination and collaboration within the region on the management of invasive species threats to biodiversity is not yet well developed.
Existing legislation, regulations and cross-sectoral policies in Pacific island countries and territories do not fully address the impact of invasive species on biodiversity. Enforcement of these legislative instruments is sometimes inadequate.
There is a shortage of technically trained personnel in Pacific island countries and there are inadequate quarantine and risk assessment facilities. There is insufficient funding for training of personnel, establishment of infrastructure, development of risk as-

sessment procedures, and management and research on invasive species.
3. Strategic directions
3.1 Aim of the regional strategy
To promote the efforts of Pacific island countries and territories in protecting and maintaining the rich and fragile natural heritage of the Pacific islands from the impacts of invasive species through cooperative efforts to: • Develop and maintain an effective, coordinated
network of information and technical expertise.
• Prevent the introduction of new invasive species.
• Reduce the impact of existing invasive species.
• Raise awareness.
• Build the capacity required to manage the threats posed by invasive species.
3.2 Components of the regional strategy
Strategy 1: Information
Strengthen both basic and applied research on invasive species by identifying high-priority research needs, and encouraging work on high-priority problems. Establish biological surveys for all member countries and territories. Emphasise prevention and early detection, and evaluation of exotic species that are present or are potential problems. Establish longterm monitoring of high-risk native areas for incursions of recognised invasive species.
Strengthen linkages between Pacific island countries and scientific institutions, sources of technical and research assistance or other bodies of information. Share information regionally through the establishment of mutually accessible databases and web sites.
Develop a regional clearinghouse for information on invasive species that is easily accessible, perhaps through a web-based information system.
Strategy 2: Awareness
Raise public awareness of invasive species threats to conservation.
Work with economic interests (operating in agriculture, aquaculture, forestry, horticulture, public health, shipping, military, some biocontrol operations, and genetically modified organisms technology) to raise their awareness of risks to biodiversity of invasive species. Represent invasive species issues at regional and national meetings, and with funding organisations in order to increase awareness.
Develop awareness of the accidental movement of invasive species into new relatively pest-free

areas, especially their inter-island transfer within one country.
Promote awareness of the inter-island transfer problem by education programmes in identification, establishing networks (national and regional), and early warning databases.
Develop awareness of the dangers of accidental introduction of invasive species to biodiversity. For example by the movement of machines and in particular the inter-island transfer of pests, especially from invaded areas to new or pest-free areas. The establishment of an effective communication network and a manual of existing and potential invasive species may assist with identification, behaviour, where to look, how to exclude, eradicate and control them.
Further communication of the problem can be achieved by networking, international linkages, national working groups, regional expert groups, and an early-warning database.
Strategy 3: Infrastructure
At the national and regional level, develop ongoing training programmes in the areas of species identification, field detection, quarantine inspections, monitoring and the like, and a network of resources that allow for the transfer of information to appropriate field workers.
Develop and upgrade regional and national facilities such as reference collections and specialised facilities for border control.
Promote and strengthen initiatives that facilitate the use and sharing of existing regional facilities by government agencies in-country and between countries (e.g. South Pacific Regional Herbarium, Bishop Museum collections, quarantine facilities).
Strategy 4: Protocols
Develop and strengthen protocols and procedures – particularly: • Develop and strengthen procedures to process
applications for species introduction to assess their potential impact on native species or ecosystems. • Promote the use of existing protocols for pest risk assessment, modified to accommodate Pacific island countries and territories, before pests are introduced into a country. • Develop early-warning and response systems for invasive species. • Develop guidelines for pest management that consider the full biological and conservation consequences of control or eradication operations, including restoration. • Collaborate with other organisations to develop appropriate policies to address the potential con-

servation/environmental risks of genetically modified organisms.
Strategy 5: Legislation
Survey existing environmental and other relevant legislation in each Pacific island country to determine its adequacy for protecting biodiversity from the threats of invasive species. Develop model legislation which includes provision for mitigating these threats and which makes use of principles developed for invasive species by other organisations (such as IUCN) and countries. Produce country-specific recommendations for modifying or developing new legislation which adequately regulates the following: • importation of all living organisms, • surveillance for new incursions, • risk analysis of import applications, • assessment of environmental risks prior to intro-
duction of genetically modified organisms, • quarantine procedures, • export of pests, • movements of species between islands, • control or eradication of invasive species, • monitoring.
Strategy 6: Funding
Develop long-term external funding mechanisms that will ensure Pacific island countries are able to undertake work for the management of threats from invasive species.
Make representation to government leaders to improve long-term funding to address the pressing issues of invasive species of conservation concern in the region. Demonstrate the extent of the invasive species problem in the region, cast in economic cost/ benefit terms and the necessity of taking action. Secure support for invasive species issues among local communities (including village councils) as well as at national, regional and political levels (e.g. South Pacific Forum). In order to make these representations for more funding, determine and develop a regional resource of materials, in easy-to-read language, that identifies the magnitude of the invasive species problems in the region. Needed information includes: the area of natural ecosystems degraded by invasive species, their conservation impact, and the consequences of not taking action.
Maximise funding self-sufficiency by promoting full participation of local communities in project development, management and implementation to ensure a long-term local commitment.
Promote invasive species as a criterion in national, regional, and international disaster management plans.

Strategy 7: Linkages
Establish and maintain a network among Pacific island countries and territories and organisations that improves communication, cooperation and information sharing, and that maximises the effectiveness of invasive species work in the Pacific. Specific actions include: develop-ment of common standards of border control, staff exchange programmes, nomination of an invasive species position within appropriate organisations, and establishment of national working groups and a regional expert group.
Regional participation is needed in the development of international standards and programmes that govern the movement of invasive species in commerce (e.g. Convention on Biological Diversity, International Plant Protection Convention, World Animal Health Organization, and others).
4. Concluding comments
The workshop confirmed the need for a regional invasive species strategy as a platform for obtaining funds for in-country projects. The country issues have been successfully tabled for those countries that participated (see Annex 1). The regional invasive species strategy may now be used as a vehicle to: (1) seek funds from international agencies and donor countries, (2) reinforce and guide national biodiversity management plans (such as the National Biodiversity Strategic Action Plans), (3) complement other regional invasive species programmes, especially the United States of America’s Invasive Species Management Plan, and (4) guide the Regional Invasive Species Programme administered by the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme in writing its annual workplans.
Finally, the workshop identified at least one regional generic need: a marine regional invasive species strategy and implementation plan which, together with the terrestrial regional species plan, may include wetlands habitats such as intertidal zones (e.g. mangrove forests and estuaries).

Invasive species in the Pacific
Annex 1. List of invasive species issues developed at the workshop

1. Information
• Lack of information on the basic biology (including distribution) of many invasive species and of the best control methods – particularly biological control methods. Part of this lack of information includes a lack of accessibility and coordination of information within the region and outside the region.
• Lack of monitoring of high-risk areas for invasive species (vulnerable sites).
2. Public awareness
• Lack of understanding, from the public, politicians, and other sectors, of the major threats posed by pests to conservation assets. This results in a lack of public commitment for both biodiversity protection and management of invasive pests.
• Competition with conservation interests from agriculture, aquaculture, forestry, horticulture, some biocontrol operations, public health considerations, traditional practices, shipping, military and genetically modified organisms technology.
• Accidental introduction of invasive species: by movement of machines, boats and materials from pest-invaded areas to pest-free areas, trampers, animals, and smuggling operations.
3. Lack of infrastructure
• Lack (quality and quantity) of technically trained personnel on the ground, and of species identification, field detection, quarantine inspections, control operations, monitoring, and research. Lack of mechanisms for transfer of information to field workers.
• Inadequate facilities to house confiscated species, fumigate, and implement adequate border control (amongst other things), but no support for upgrading some regional facilities and thus these facilities do not reach their full potential.
4. Protocols
• Lack of a system to warn of impending threats.
• Lack of adequate pest risk assessment procedure which is accurate and can cope with all variables.
• Intractable problem of inability to predict invasiveness (risk assessment) of new species, including genetically modified organisms, at the border, or as a target for eradication or for control.
• Inadequate quarantine procedures, which are too cumbersome, and are not fully implemented (in-
4

adequate checks). Lack of collaboration in some instances (between different agencies/countries) and inefficient use of limited resources in some Pacific island countries and territories. No protocol to ensure detection/assessment of organisms/ commodities being brought into a country, including illegally, and lack of emphasis on (recognition of) conservation threats at quarantine.
• No protocols to determine the priorities for eradication and control.
• Lack of early detection and evaluation action on new pest incursions may lead to bigger problems later.
• Lack of appropriate processes to implement legislation.
• Inter-island movement of pests is not controlled due to a lack of protocols and regulations.
• No control of the export of pests.
• Lack of knowledge or planning for the full biological and conservation consequences of control operations.
• Poorly defined or no standards of phytosanitary measures, or pest risk analysis.
5. Legislation
• Absence of, or inadequate or ineffective legislation to protect conservation values.
• Lack of legislation that regulates exports and imports against the risks of invasive species.
• Not enough enforcement of legislation, for various reasons.
6. Inadequate funding
• Lack of funding for technical work such as research on control methods, taxonomy (identification), impact of invasive species, survey work, monitoring, eradication or control.
• Inadequate distribution of funding siphoned off by other activities (other than invasive species) within the country or by other countries.
• Projects dependent on outside sources of funding.
• Poor mechanisms to ensure adequate and timely funding, such as not coinciding with the timing of the life cycle of the invasive species.
• Not enough funding for resources and personnel or the mechanism in place for these people to set priorities to maximise the benefits for conservation.

Draft invasive species strategy

7. Linkages
• Pacific island countries and territories and regional organisations do not yet share enough information or consult with each other, e.g. sharing information and making agreements to set common standards for border control.

• Too little cooperation between quarantine officers and the public.
• Difficulties cooperating across international borders due to disputes and differing conservation values.

Towards a regional invasive species strategy for the South Pacific: issues and options

1. Introduction
The purpose of this paper was to assist workshop participants from the SPREP member countries whose task was to create a regional strategy for invasive species in the South Pacific. The paper uses nontechnical language to provide a summary of the status of invasive species in the South Pacific Region. This summary is compiled from the technical reviews which follow in this publication.
The technical reviews were commissioned by SPREP, but planned and designed by an ad-hoc working group, which included the Invasive Species Specialist Group (ISSG) of the Species Survival Commission of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This partnership is consistent with Resolution 15 of the Sixth Pacific Conference on Nature Conservation and Protected Areas, which specifically charges IUCN and SPREP to undertake such work.
The terrestrial invasive species technical reviews dealt with the following subject areas: vertebrates; plants; insects; molluscs (snails and bivalves); and frogs, toads and other animal species which invade freshwater systems. Little published information is available on the paths invasive species take to enter countries, and the types of invasive species legislation which exist in the South Pacific. We attempt to provide brief summaries of these areas, and have also summarised the main findings from each technical review so that their conclusions may be easily understood.
2. What is a “strategy” for the South Pacific?
The term strategy is a military one but has a usage in business or politics as “a plan of action or policy”. Implicit in our interpretation of strategy is a statement of “how to achieve a declared end point”. A strategy which applies to an area the size of the South Pacific will necessarily be general. The main benefits in having an agreed strategy which has been designed by Pacific island delegates include: (1) en-

suring acceptance by Pacific island countries when it is being implemented, (2) avoiding ad-hoc actions, and (3) gaining the maximum efficiency for the limited resources available. The objective of the Regional Invasive Species Strategy is that in-country projects will bring benefits to countries. It is the intention of the Regional Invasive Species Programme administered by SPREP that the strategy (developed at the Nadi workshop) be adhered to in decisions where funding is required. We would hope that other agencies such as those representing the governments of France and the United States of America would also consider the RISS in their decision-making.
The main components of a strategy include a central aim or statement of purpose, listing the actions to be taken towards achieving a set of desired outcomes. For the purposes of the RISS it is suggested that a practical time frame for making significant progress would be five years from 2000. This will approximately match the funding period of the current invasive species programme administered by SPREP. The rest of the strategy is basically a set of generic actions which are required to redress identified invasive species issues within the region. Specific time frames may be set for actions, and there may be some prioritisation of implementation. Each of the actions will, in some way, partly satisfy the overall aim of the strategy, and collectively they should meet its overall aim.
3. Technical summaries
This section summarises the main biological information presented in the technical papers which follow. We describe the current level of knowledge about different groups of invasive species in the region, and the important points which need to be understood in order to create a regional strategy to reduce their threat.
3.1 Vertebrates
The impact of large vertebrates on Pacific island ecosystems has been dramatic. Ecosystems have been

wholly changed by the importation of animals such as pigs, cattle, and goats for food, or mongooses for control of other pests such as rats. While many people may culturally or economically value an animal such as the pig, it is important to understand the devastating ecological, and thus often long-term cultural, social, and economic effects they have.
Cattle, goats and pigs are ecologically very destructive in their habits. They will eat tree seedlings, so slowing or even halting the replacement of forest canopies, and reducing native plant diversity. Goats are present on at least nine island groups within the SPREP region. Wherever they are present in dense populations, they may cause great destruction to vegetation and landscapes (often through the ensuing soil erosion), resulting in total habitat loss. Thus may forests be changed into grasslands, as has happened on Isabela Island (Galapagos), or be made more vulnerable to further invasion by weeds, or to cyclone damage. In such cases, a goat eradication operation could help preserve the integrity of a whole island ecosystem.
Perhaps the worst of the larger vertebrates is the pig. Pigs eat and uproot tree seedlings, and break open tree-fern trunks, looking for starch. Rooting also provides gaps for invasive weed seeds to become established, and pigs facilitate this process by eating, and then spreading in their droppings, seeds such as guava (particularly Psidium species). A further consequence of the uprooting and wallowing habit of pigs is the appearance of holes in which water may settle, and where mosquitoes (possibly carrying avian malaria) may breed. Such gross habitat disturbance destroys the habitats of populations of large native invertebrates such as earthworms and snails. In addition, pigs eat their eggs, juvenile growth stages or adults. Pigs are recorded digging seabirds from their burrows, and eating eggs, chicks and adults. They damage crops and tree plantations, and may spread disease to other animals.
Many of these species become part of more complex ecological interactions, and failure to notice or understand these has led, in the past, to inter-species “chain reactions” of problems. An example of this was the introduction of monitor lizards to Micronesia after World War II, in an attempt to control Pacific and ship rats; but the monitors were diurnal, the rats nocturnal, so the two never met. The monitors, which were seeking food, ate local chickens. To avoid this, cane toads were brought in to provide an alternative food source for the monitors. The toads’ poison killed many of them, by which time it was discovered that the monitors had been both controlling the grubs of rhinoceros beetles (that had been damaging coconut

palms) and preying on coconut crabs (which had been controlling giant African snails). As the monitors died off, the toads increased in number and were eaten by pigs, cats and dogs, which were then also poisoned. Without these predators, rat numbers increased—the original problem—and the snails began to scavenge on the cat and dog carcasses (Lever 1994). It is obvious that the consequences of the monitor lizard introduction were much more far-reaching than anybody had anticipated.
A further example of species interactions is provided by the Macquarie parakeet. This bird had managed to survive for many years on subantarctic Macqaurie Island in the presence of cats, but was made extinct only after the colonisation of the island by rabbits. Rabbits provided enough food to enable the cat population to increase in numbers, and thus to prey on more birds too.
Various endemic ground-dwelling birds live on many of the remote islands, and these, as well as groundnesting seabirds, are often especially vulnerable to introduced mammals including pigs, cats and dogs, and may be driven to extinction by them. The three species of rats in the region—Norway, Pacific and ship rats—also all prey on seabirds to varying degrees. The Norway rat preys on eggs, young, and sometimes adults of ducks, wading birds and seabirds.
Both the Pacific rat and ship rat consume a wide range of prey, including many invertebrate and plant items such as earthworms, centipedes, larvae of some butterflies and moths, ants, beetles, weevils, cicadas, snails, spiders, lizards and birds, plus fleshy fruit and other seeds, flowers, stems, and roots. They may also prey on the eggs and young of forest birds.
It is well known that rats and other vertebrates can swim between islands, though it is not completely clear what distances different species can cover under different conditions. A nineteenth century attempt to save a threatened bird species by translocation to an offshore island is known to have failed because of the choice of an island too close to an infested area: the flightless ground parrot of New Zealand (kakapo or Strigops habroptilus) was taken in the late 1800s to Resolution Island, but stoats were later able to colonise from the nearby mainland. The parrot was lost from that island and later became extinct on the mainland (although it survived—just—on Stewart Island).
Archaeological remains from islands show past distributions of birds which no longer survive. On Aitutaki, for example, Steadman (1991) records: “six archaeological sites up to 1000 years old…have yielded bones of 15 species of birds, five of which no longer occur on the island…Of these, only (two)

survive anywhere in the Cook Islands today”. Mammals found there currently include the Pacific rat, dog and pig. Recent archaeological work on Fiji (Worthy et al. 1999) also revealed many species that have become extinct since human colonisation: a crocodilian, tortoise, frog and iguana, as well as a giant pigeon and giant megapode, the latter both flightless.
The brown tree snake is a species that is widely recognised as having caused ecological devastation on Guam. Introduced to that island by mistake in the late 1940s, historical evidence of its slow spread across the island was gained from records of the gradual absence of bird species from the forests. Eventually it was discovered that the snake had caused the extinction of 9 of 11 of Guam’s original native forest bird species, by preying on eggs, nestlings and adults. The brown tree snake also causes power outages, and has occasionally been found biting infant humans. Whilst it was previously thought to be a specialist predator, research has shown that the snake is actually more of a generalist. It is now known to take small mammals and lizards as well as birds, and on Guam is thought to have caused the extinction of three species of skink and two species of gecko. This flexibility in its diet has no doubt assisted in its ability to spread rapidly. These snakes can travel between islands concealed in aircraft undercarriages and in containers. Individuals have already been seen in Spain, Texas (USA) and Hawaii. It is imperative that vessels arriving to any state from Guam, or from countries of the snake’s native range (northern Australia, the Solomon Islands or Papua New Guinea), be thoroughly checked every time for snakes.
Mongooses are currently distributed only through Fiji and Hawaii, where they have a wide sphere of influence: they eat the young of the endangered Hawaiian crow, as well as eggs and incubating females of the Nene goose. They also attack hawkesbill turtle hatchlings and ground-dwelling birds, and spread the seeds of strawberry guava.
There is no doubt about the serious impact that cats, rats, pigs, mongooses and brown tree snakes have on the wildlife of any island they reach. Little appears to be known, however, about the effects of species such as the house mouse, cane toad, and musk shrew.
Little is known either about introduced birds. The greatest threats they pose to native birds seem to be hybridisation, competition for food or nest sites, or introduction of disease. The mallard duck is known to have hybridised with the grey duck in New Zealand, the Hawaiian duck in Hawaii, and an endemic

race of the Pacific spot-billed duck in the Mariana Islands, so that each of these endemic forms has been threatened or replaced. There have been no studies of competition between native birds and introduced myna birds or red-vented bulbuls, although it is believed that interactions must occur. However, there are records of common mynas eating the eggs of wedge-tailed shearwaters, and the eggs and chicks of landbirds in New Zealand, as well as being predators of the Tahitian flycatcher. The greatest numbers of introduced birds occur in Hawaii (47), the Society Islands (12), and the Fijian islands (11).
3.2 Plants
Invasive plants may have the following effects on the native flora and communities (including the processes which occur in them): decreased dominance of native species; decreased overall species richness (of native plants and those other native plants and animals that depend on them); fewer vertical tiers of plants (canopy, sub-canopy, etc); lower range of biodiversity over areas; competition with native species; displacement of native species; changes to processes such as water table levels, fire regimes, soil quality and nutrient cycling.
Some phenomena in the plant world are not well understood—such as the ability of naturalised exotic plants to establish in their new country without at first compromising conservation values, but then changing their behaviour over a short period of time and becoming pest species. Thus caution should be observed in considering species for importation: if a species is a problem in one country, it is likely to become a problem in another. This is true of any species but is especially well known in plants. Risk analysis methods exist to reduce the risk of plant importation, given that many may, in future, become pests. On the other hand, introduced plant species which are not pests in one country may in fact turn out to be so in another – probably because the environmental conditions in the new location are more favourable.
Some of the key weed species which have been identified as aggressive invasive species in many South Pacific countries include:
• trees and shrubs: acacias, African tulip tree (Spathodea), wild tamarind (or lead) tree (Leucaena), guava species (Psidium), Miconia (velvet tree), red sandalwood tree (Adenanthera), Koster’s curse (Clidemia), Lantana, giant sensitive plant (Mimosa);
• vines: mile-a-minute (Mikania), passion-fruit species (Passiflora), Merremia;

9

Invasive species in the Pacific

• grasses: elephant grass (Pennisetum), Paspalum;
• aquatic plants: water hyacinth (Eichhornia).
Many others exist, but the above species are considered to be significant threats to conservation values in at least three, and often many more, Pacific island countries.
An important distinction between types of invasive plants needs to be made. Some may only be significant in areas which are already modified, and will not be important in, for example, continuous native forest. Others may be a problem in both modified and unmodified habitat (disturbance may simply accelerate the rate of colonisation). This broad colonising capability is partly due to their more aggressive nature and capability to actively invade.
Before control or eradication operations can begin, technical information is required about the ecology of the weed. For example, burning may not be a desirable method of control because many plants are fire adapted. Thus they may actually be given an advantage over native species that are not fire adapted. Other considerations that relate to the ecology of the species may be quite subtle. For example, some pest plants in a locality may be only of one sex, so their removal will be permanent (unless the species has the ability to reproduce without seeds) because there is unlikely to be a seed bank from which they can recolonise.
3.3 Insects and other hard-bodied bugs
There is little information on the impacts of invasive insects and similar animals, but it is certain that they have been invading since humans began colonising islands, and it seems likely that their impacts on native species have been dramatic. The impacts of harmful insects are difficult to assess, partly because there is very incomplete knowledge of which species occur naturally in various countries. Thus it is hard to link the presence of introduced insect species with any decline in native species, or other effects such as habitat changes.
The types of insects that are most likely to become pests are the predators (those that feed on other animals), although those that feed on plants, or use other animals or plants as a host or for shelter, can also greatly affect conservation values. The most likely types of insects to colonise a new island are those which are adaptable, and species which do not necessarily need males and females for reproduction. The most favourable situation for invasion is one where suitable host plants or animals and matching climatic conditions already exist. Some insects, such

as aphids and white-flies, may act as vectors of viruses and mycoplasma-like organisms (microscopic sub-cellular life forms which may become pathogenic in a plant’s cell) which may cause even more damage than the insect itself.
Ants
Ants present one of the greatest threats to many native species (not just other insects or bugs), and their effects on native communities have been relatively well-documented. The pest ant species meet many of the classic characteristics of successful colonising pest species: they are adaptable, generalist feeders, tolerant of widely varying environmental conditions, and are aggressive colonisers. The ecological significance of this group is that they prey on almost any other insect or “bug” and may also prey on birds and other large animals. Thus they may affect whole communities at once, and may dramatically and irreversibly change these through their ability to cause many local extinctions. It is worth noting too, that the removal of whole groups of insects and other “bug” species will probably cause flow-on effects in the community to remaining species which would normally depend on them, e.g. native birds. Ants also feed on the sugary secretions from bugs feeding on woody plant species, and so may protect these insects from their natural predators, allowing them to reach unusually high densities on the plants, which may then become stressed and die. In other words, the whole structure of the native habitat may be affected.
Some of the ant species have biological characteristics which make them particularly easy to accidentally introduce to new islands, where they may become established. The species are tiny, and difficult to intercept at quarantine, especially if officers are not forewarned of the characteristics of ants and how to find them in, or on, materials entering the country. Some of the pest species, unlike other ants, have many queens to a “super-nest”, any one of which may be transported to start up new colonies. Some of these pest ant species are not territorial but tolerate ants from different nests, so they may reach extremely high densities and have a major impact on native species.
The problem of ant range expansion is compounded because some people have a mistaken belief that these ant species can be used in agriculture for biological control of pest insects which are attacking commercial crops. In some parts of the world, local people actively spread ant species, hoping to take advantage of their aggressive biological characteristics to

10

Sherley and Lowe: Towards a regional invasive species strategy

remove all the pest insects in the area. There has been little or no scientific study on the effectiveness of this method, but there is more than enough evidence to show the undesirable effects on native ecosystems that result from ants being imported into a region.
The following species present a grave threat to conservation values because they will invade native communities and affect many or all of the animals and plants in that community: big-headed ant; long-legged or crazy ant; Argentine ant; fire ant; Solenopsis papuana; glaber ant; little fire ant (Wasmannia auropunctata). This last-named species may be one of the biggest threats to the conservation of native communities because of its aggressive behaviour, pervasive effects on all sectors of the community, and ease of spread to new islands.
Pest ant species are known to have a widespread distribution in the Pacific. However, given the lack of specialised survey and identification expertise available, the distribution is almost certainly greater than currently reported. For any strategy against ants, the essential points to consider are that: (1) no individual species has colonised all island groups, and therefore it is well worthwhile protecting the remaining islands from further invasions, given the severe impact these insects have on native communities, and (2) the rate the ant species are spreading to new island groups is extremely fast and is therefore presenting a serious threat to native biodiversity.
Wasps
Wasps belong to the same large group of insects as ants, and hence share many of their biological characteristics and present much the same problem to native species and habitats. Some wasp species create queens which lie hidden in dark shelters until the next nest-making season. At this time they may find hideaways on packing cases or containers and thereby effectively introduce themselves to a new island. Wasps are very efficient predators and colonisers; as they can fly further than ants, they probably are able to colonise faster.
Two main groups of wasps present threats to conservation values: the Vespula and Polistes groups. Both form colonies called “nests”, but the former group creates much larger nests than the latter. The sting of these wasps is usually extremely painful to people and therefore the wasps present a public nuisance problem. In New Zealand the Vespula wasp can occur in such high densities in the forest areas of plentiful honeydew where they feed that they exclude people. Vespula wasps may be controlled by poisoning techniques, although it is much more costeffective, as with all pest species, to keep them out.

Mosquitoes
Certain mosquitoes may transmit the one-celled organism which causes avian malaria. This disease can cause the extinction of bird species, as has happened on Hawaii. The most likely way that bird malaria may arrive in a country is through the introduction of non-native birds (such as cage birds or pets) infected with the disease.
Other groups of insects
The beetle group is one of the most diverse Orders of (mainly) terrestrial animals in the world. This group, and also moths/butterflies, scale insects, mealybugs, aphids and white-flies, are extremely successful invaders. Many of these groups have the biological characteristics of the ants, and many species in these groups are known as serious pests, but the great majority of documented cases have been pests of agriculture. Little is known about their impacts on native habitats and species but it is certain that they present a grave threat. For example, the Asian gypsy moth threatens all forests (exotic as well as native) in temperate countries through the effects of its larva feeding in huge densities on the leaves of trees. Overall, the interception of exotic beetles and moths or butterflies is essential to prevent their having an impact on native habitat.
3.4 Land snails
The snail fauna on many Pacific islands is being destroyed very quickly by invasive snails, resulting in a loss of diversity between and within island groups. Introduced land snails may be extremely efficient predators, causing the relatively rapid extinction of native land snail species, while other introduced land snails may be extremely efficient at feeding on plants and may destroy the native habitat. In general, the invasive species also have exceptionally fast rates of reproduction, often faster than the native species of snail they prey on. Many of the native snail species grow and reproduce at extremely slow rates, so the depredations of the introduced snails will mean a long period is required to allow recovery. Other invasive land snails may cause reduction in numbers of native species because they live in high population densities, and so force competition for resources. It is not often realised how devastating the effect of such activity by such small species can be.
The high islands appear to harbour the highest diversity of native land snails (as well as other small native animals such as insects) and are therefore at greatest risk from the effects of introduced snail species. However, there are major gaps in knowledge of the distribution of introduced land snails, including in

11

Invasive species in the Pacific

the following countries: Palau, Fiji, Tonga, Solomon Islands, Society Islands (French Polynesia), some of Samoa, New Caledonia and Papua New Guinea.
The giant African land snail has been considered to be a threat to agriculture and a nuisance. It has also been implicated in the transmission of a form of meningitis. This has prompted the introduction of at least two species in various countries to reduce its numbers: a predatory snail (called the “rosy wolf snail”, Euglandina rosea) and a flatworm, Platydemus monokwari. There has been poor documentation of the success or otherwise of these introduced species in controlling the giant African snail, and there are cases where they have been introduced despite the lack of prior testing to ensure that they would attack only the giant African landsnail and not native species.
Agricultural practices have been identified as the cause of entry for other invasive species of snails, moved for example in soil adhering to the rootstock of horticultural products. One species of freshwater snail carries a parasite of cattle, the liver fluke. This tempts officials to try to control snail numbers using predatory species, but these introductions do not restrict their prey to the snail carrying the fluke, and therefore place native species at risk.
Deliberate introduction usually happens for two reasons: (1) a species is seen as a beneficial food or “improvement” on locally available hunting stocks, and (2) it is an ill-advised, or sometimes illegal, attempt to remedy a previous such introduction of food species which has turned disastrous, such as the predators to control the giant African snail. Species have also been introduced by the aquarium trade. All introductions for commercial reasons have resulted in escapees establishing populations in the wild. Probably between 100 and 200 non-native species of land snail have been introduced to islands around the Pacific. However, a lack of information on the ecology of many invasive species of land snail means it is difficult to predict which islands are at risk and therefore where to focus conservation efforts. For much the same reason, the eradication of pest snail species is probably technically impossible at present except perhaps on a small scale. Prevention of entry, rather than later control, is the most important means of stopping the spread of pest snails.
3.5 Invasive freshwater fish, toads, frogs, and crayfish
The reasons for fish being introduced include: aquaculture (“farming” an aquatic species for export or local markets), sport, the “improvement” of wild

stock (introducing a new food species into a waterway), the aquarium trade, the control of pest species, and accidental introductions.
Introduced fish may have the following impacts: modification of habitat (such as removal of key plant species and lowering of water quality); introduction of parasites, pathogens and diseases; changes in the availability of food for native fish species; hybridisation with native fish species; and forced change in the distribution of native fish species. Nine fish species have been introduced into four or more territories and three species, namely the Mozambique tilapia, mosquito fish and guppy, into 10 or more territories in the South Pacific. The tilapia has been introduced to control mosquitoes and weeds, and as a bait fish, but has become a pest in most instances. Reductions in the numbers of native fish and bird species have been linked to its introduction. Similar effects have been observed with other fish groups, including guppies, which are popular with the aquarium industry. Aquarium and aquaculture species introduced into the wild are likely to have had the same impacts, such as destruction of populations of native species.
Native frogs and toads are virtually non-existent east of the Melanesian islands. The most widespread introduced species is the cane toad, usually intended to control pest insects of agriculture. Little or no robust scientific evidence exists to show that the toads are actually controlling pest species, whereas scientific studies in Papua New Guinea show that their introduction there has been more disastrous than beneficial: they have become a nuisance and have been responsible for dog, cat, and even some human, deaths. Native snakes taking the toad are probably also at risk from poisoning.
Another introduction, tree frogs from the Caribbean, is potentially disastrous because of the frogs’ predatory impacts on native insect species and competitive interactions with birds.
At least five species of freshwater crayfish or prawnlike species have been introduced to Pacific island freshwater systems. These include the giant Malaysian prawn and the giant freshwater prawn, which have both been introduced for aquaculture. These and other species may escape into freshwater habitats or establish there through deliberate introductions, and are known to carry diseases and parasites which are foreign to the native species and potentially devastating. They may also be voracious predators on native freshwater fauna such as snails.
Because there are relatively few (compared to continental islands or continents) freshwater or brackish

12

Sherley and Lowe: Towards a regional invasive species strategy

habitats in the Pacific islands, a premium is placed on their conservation.
4. Legislation
No systematic review exists of all SPREP Pacific island country legislation which focuses on invasive species. Two projects which at least partly address this are under way, but at the time of writing no results were available. However, twenty-one countries were surveyed to determine whether they had legislation which specifically dealt with preventing the introduction of alien species—whether or not that species was a potential threat to conservation, human health or economic interests such as agriculture. There was no information available for nine countries. Of the remaining 12, all had legislation which dealt with the quarantine of new organisms being brought into the country. Most of these seemed to be focused on species which might affect agricultural interests. The Cook Islands had one statute which dealt specifically with containers and the special threat they pose as vehicles for invasive species.
A review of environmental legislation of the Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Kingdom of Tonga, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Solomon Islands (Boer 1996) includes descriptions of legislation covering wildlife, natural areas, agriculture and forestry, and fisheries. Hence, this legislation nominally dealt with invasive species affecting conservation values. Almost none of the legislation from these countries which addressed wildlife and its habitat included regulations dealing with invasive species which might threaten these values. Invasive species were dealt with in the legislation for agriculture and forestry, and fisheries (mainly marine), and thus ignore natural areas and conservation values. Interestingly, of the recommendations made in that report on the form new legislation should take, none included upgrading the statutes dealing with invasive species – let alone mention of invasive species which threaten native wildlife and its habitat. Exceptions to the lack of legislation banning importing wildlife except under permit included Yap and Kosrae (both dealing with parrots).
5. Pathways: how invasive species get to new localities
This section describes how exotic species gain entry into new islands or countries. The information has been drawn from the technical reviews for the various major groups of animals and plants, from discussions with quarantine officers and law enforcement officers, and from personal experience.

5.1 Intentional introductions
Many pest species have gained widespread distribution in a country due to the planned and coordinated efforts of people—often officials—introducing one species for the control of another pest species. This practice is referred to as “biocontrol”. For example, the cane toad was introduced in Fiji to control insect pests which were thought to occur in sugar cane fields. The problem is that the species introduced may prey instead on native or non-pest species and itself become a pest, as has in fact occurred in Fiji with cane toads. Plants, too, are widely used and distributed by humans. Many trees used for plantation forestry (e.g. eucalypts, acacias) or for soil stabilisation (e.g. some grasses) become invasive. In New Zealand, for example, about three-quarters of the weeds of concern to conservation were brought in for horticultural uses. Occasionally a species is planted with the best of intentions, such as the creation of wildlife habitat: unique mudflat habitat has been destroyed on Rodrigues Island (Indian Ocean) by the planting of mangrove trees for wildlife, in areas where the mangrove did not naturally occur.
Imported species (such as prawns and fish) which are intended as new food “products” may become pests because they inevitably escape or are released into native habitat, perhaps when the introduction becomes uneconomic and the venture is abandoned. Some of these profit-driven introductions have been made by government employees who have by-passed normal approval channels in an attempt to ease the establishment of commercial ventures.
Illegal imports may include protected species in contravention of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES). These species may not be rare (although still protected in their home country), but nonetheless will be successful at colonising a new country and will become pests. This risk relates to the fact that most captive animals at some stage end up being released into the wild. It is a common human reaction to want to “release” an unwanted pet into the wild rather than have it killed. What are border officials to do with intercepted rare or protected species? To kill them would be to reduce the population still further. To sell them would mean that smugglers may be able to buy them for a small fee and continue smuggling. To keep them in captivity for the rest of their lives is expensive and perhaps inhumane. To repatriate them is usually unthinkable—where exactly did they come from, and have they been exposed to disease on the way? To release them is to risk introducing any disease they might be carrying.

13

Invasive species in the Pacific

Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) may also be invasive species in the wild or may become invasive species (for example, if genetically modified pollen fertilises related local plants). Thus rigorous risk assessment procedures (such as are used by Australia) need to be carried out before such species or their seeds are imported. One of the issues associated with GMOs is whether the importer or the exporter should carry out risk assessments on the likelihood of organism escape, hybridisation, and establishment in the wild. Two considerations in resolving this issue are the high cost (and who should carry it while retaining scientific rigour) of scientifically assessing what the risks are, and of the availability of required technical expertise, especially in developing countries.

locations where invasive species can gain access to them.
(6) Horticultural imports such as seed (without a purity test), root crops (which may contain soil residue and its associated organisms), and live plant material (which might harbour invasive species on or inside the material, or be a weed species itself).
(7) Many countries are entering into free-trade agreements which may involve effectively “dropping their guard” against the risks of importing invasive species. Thus each new agreement needs to be professionally and critically reviewed to check that no extra risk of invasive species is involved.

5.2 Unintentional introductions by humans
Unintentional introductions are avoidable if standard operating procedures are followed. Cases where the development of a procedure is vitally important include the following:
(1) Military use (naval and aerial) of islands for exercises and the inadvertent importation of alien species. This is aggravated by the military’s often assumed “right” to “go anywhere at any time” regardless of the risks, in this case, to native fauna.
(2) Discharge to local waterways of ships’ ballast water containing new species which are often aggressive invaders. Standard operating requirements, such as ballast discharge in blue waters, may reduce this risk.
(3) Importation of timber chip and timber (especially if the bark is present), bringing in insects and disease organisms. Such imports should (a) be subject to regular checks for the presence of disease and (b) never be complete with bark, which acts as an excellent shelter for insects and other species.
(4) Tourist activities, which may introduce invasive species to pristine islands. These introductions may be from tour guides not checking visitors’ boots and equipment, or yachts making unauthorised visits, and from either type of visitor failing to observe standard practices for visiting pest-free islands.
(5) Packaging and containers which may carry invasive species. The organisms may occupy the goods, packaging, or container itself at the port of origin or en route, especially if the goods, packaging, or container are left to “stand” in

5.3 Negligence and other factors
Despite existing regulations (such as quarantine), enforcement may not be implemented, perhaps through negligence, ignorance, or a lack of facilities to carry out the tasks required. Proper enforcement of existing legislation is often enough to block a pathway previously open to invasive species. Current training of quarantine officers is generally not extensive enough to include invasive species that threaten conservation values; it is mostly limited to pests which threaten agricultural, forestry, fishery or human health values. Though overlap occurs, training programmes need to recognise the inter-relatedness of these fields, and to accord importance to conservation values in their own right.
5.4 Biological dispersal, or selfintroduction of species
Plants and animals have evolved highly sophisticated means of dispersal and will, of their own accord, colonise new habitat and islands once humans have helped by taking them to a new country or island group.
Introductions of new or even existing species of animals to islands or countries may, unwittingly, involve the introduction of associated parasites or disease organisms. The problem is reduced with proper quarantine procedures.
Many invasive species may be spread by native or exotic animals. An example is the bulbul (itself an invasive species), which will feed on fruits of invasive plants and spread the seeds through its droppings. Similarly, pigs will spread seeds this way, and at the same time will accelerate the spread of invasive plants by changing the conditions in an area through pugging and rooting of the ground. Browsing species such as goats and cattle have the same

14

Sherley and Lowe: Towards a regional invasive species strategy

effect by removing the native species from near the ground, allowing unpalatable weed species to colonise the area.
6. Issues arising from this review of invasive species
6.1 Information
Because of the nature of the Pacific islands region (i.e. huge area, scattered island groups), there are problems with the gathering of information and with communication. The vast ocean distances between small island nations mean that frequent visits for monitoring purposes are not practical. Remote islands are less well known biologically, while the bigger, more populated islands are usually better known, so information is unevenly spread between islands.
To be able to predict and warn of possible new species invasions, basic information is needed about which taxa are on which islands, and which pathways exist between islands. However, this information is generally lacking. There are not many analyses of shipping patterns and container routeing, noting sources, destinations, and trans-shipment stations. Such work, plus an analysis of success rates of species interceptions (including data on what is being sent to whom and from where) for mail and customs at air and seaports, would be very useful. After more invasive species information has been collected, care should also be taken to store and disseminate it accessibly, so that managers and decision-makers can make optimum use of it. Dissemination of information could be achieved using databases such as the Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk database (http:// www.hear.org/pier/) or the ISSG/GISP Global Invasive Species Database and Early Warning System (http://www.issg.org) although it needs to be borne in mind that not all island countries have ready access to the internet.
Technically, communication is often a problem: telephone lines may be of poor quality with perhaps only one line serving a whole organisation. Culturally, many people prefer to communicate directly with people they know, face to face, rather than with strangers by letter or telephone. In the effort to improve conservation information and techniques within the Pacific, it is the local people who can provide the understanding of how to link conservation practice and culture, in order to improve the status of threatened species, or restore partially destroyed ecosystems.
National borders are an obvious place to start the search for newly arriving species. Each nation needs to consider whether its resources are being used as

effectively as possible at borders, and to ask in general: how is it best to monitor an island or island group for newly introduced species, and who has responsibility for reporting and dealing with such incursions? Border control officers need to know what kind of organisms they are looking for, how they might behave and where they may be hidden. But at the same time they must continue to search for any new organisms not previously known as invasive species. As many incoming goods should be checked as resources allow. In addition, the wider region would benefit if individual nations inspected their exports before dispatch. In summary, there should be a dedicated team, specifically monitoring border entry sites and looking for founder populations. In island nations, it is also important to monitor inter-island traffic. An IUCN Environmental Policy and Law paper observes of one government department within the Pacific region: “The plant and animal quarantine section of the Division is poorly staffed, and underequipped. Inter-island movement of goods is relatively unfettered. Quarantine regulations are little known and rarely used. Enforcement is infrequent.” (Boer 1996). Better information will begin to solve some of these problems.
As well as border surveillance, it is useful to have a network of people alert for any new records of species. If there are no conservation workers or field officers regularly “covering” an area, there may be guides, tour leaders, or dive operators who could at least be asked (and educated) to watch for out-ofthe-ordinary animals or plants, and perhaps even to perform a monitoring role.
Education of the public, land managers, politicians and decision-makers should aim to demonstrate the value of biodiversity, and the implications of its loss through invasive species. One important question is: what are the best methods within the Pacific cultural context, for education of the general public or specialists (e.g. quarantine officers)? Such education should be strongly focused on the conservation aspects of invasive species, not solely the agricultural/ economic or human health aspects. National media may help with this, as have the newspapers in Tahiti, in reporting about Miconia, known locally as the “green cancer”. Tahiti’s Ministry of Health and the military have helped, with their efforts to clear some areas of this pervasive tree, which now covers windward Tahiti.
Today, we believe we recognise the problems that introduced species can cause, and yet there remain many cases, perhaps still due to ignorance or insufficient scientific knowledge, where seemingly harmful decisions are taken. To confound matters, poor

Invasive species in the Pacific

technical information may be given to biological control practitioners. The predatory rosy wolf snail was introduced on the basis of “technical advice” to control the giant African snail, which is a crop pest. No proper screening process had been followed (even though such protocols existed) to ensure that the introduced snail attacked only the intended prey. Rosy wolf snails, though much smaller than the giant African snails, do prey on them. However, for whatever reason, they made a much better living preying on native and endemic snails, including families such as the Partulid tree snails (of Moorea and Tahiti), which are now either locally extinct or very threatened. Similarly, “technical advice” has been given by “reputable” sources about the flatworm Platydemus monokwari. After introduction as a biocontrol agent, it was found to consume native snails. The result of this poor information has been widespread losses of many species of snails, a number of which were genetically unique to separate valleys.
These cases of bad practice include (1) taking guidance from projects which are poorly reported, or in which the technical information was incomplete or never gathered; (2) farmers or landowners taking it upon themselves to introduce species for their own ends, regardless of any regulations which might exist to prevent such actions; (3) simply ignoring previous bad experiences with the same introductions despite contrary advice.
Intelligence gathering related to illegal practices such as smuggling is required. Western Pacific rim countries and Pacific island countries already have cooperative joint security committees. Invasive species should be placed on their agenda as a legitimate national security issue. Similarly, the issues (as described above) for GMOs need urgent consideration, to keep pace with dramatically increasing commercial pressures to develop and use GMOs and their products.
6.2 Research
Before policy can be set, there is a great need for background knowledge and basic research. Which species are “native” in a country? In order to answer this question, there is a need for palaeoecological studies (to discover which species were living at certain times), and biosystematic studies of locally occurring native taxa.
Once there is good local knowledge of native species distribution, decisions can be more easily made about where the remaining populations of native or endemic taxa exist, so that these areas can be made

a priority for conservation. It is also important to carry out “baseline surveys” and monitoring, in order to anticipate possible damage from newly arrived species.
Compiling an inventory of islands which are candidates for restoration should be attempted, namely those with a relative absence of pests, or with biologically important communities of flora or fauna. These islands then need surveying for pest species and their impacts (especially on islands of over five hectares), and a priority-setting system should be developed which permits identification of target islands for restoration projects and funding.
New “early detection” methods (intercepting pest species at low densities) are required so that founder populations can be efficiently detected and destroyed, and so that the monitoring of invasive species during control and eradication operations is possible. Some of the most devastating groups of organisms for which there should be a special watch are ants, wasps, the brown tree snake, rats, Miconia calvescens, and Mikania micrantha.
Other research topics which would greatly aid this work include:
(1) design of suitable bait types (distributed in weatherproof bait stations) for use in the tropics against rats;
(2) new techniques for border control officers for the detection of new invasive species which may threaten conservation values;
(3) risk assessment of species proposed for importation using models such as exist in Australia and New Zealand. Emphasis should be placed on assessing their risk to conservation values rather than to economic interests and human health. If current risk assessment methods are inadequate for this purpose, new methods need to be designed.
6.3 Policy, Legislation, Advocacy
Invasive species are known to threaten human health, economic values and conservation values, all of which are inter-related. Until now, there has tended to be least recognition of the huge impact of invasive species on natural flora and fauna. Future policy and legislation should reflect the extra need to protect conservation values.
Legislation is required in most cases to demonstrate the seriousness of the need to prevent invasive species that harm conservation values, and to effect change. Once legislation exists, there is a serious need

16

Sherley and Lowe: Towards a regional invasive species strategy

for resources (e.g. enforcement officers, isolation facilities, search equipment) for its implementation. Enforcement is the cornerstone of this legislation; legal statutes are useless if compliance mechanisms do not exist.
When such legislation is drafted, local people and customary landowners need to be convinced of the uniqueness and importance of their local environment. If they are consulted about how best to monitor for invasive species, and to work within local custom, the project stands the greatest chance of success, and the least expense will be required for enforcement.
6.4 Trade
As trade volumes increase within the region, and the commodities traded become increasingly “westernised”, people within the region are exposed to a greater choice and quantity of imported goods. With a larger volume of materials being moved, and new levels of consumption involving more packaging, the likelihood of transporting new species is heightened. With it comes the risk of destruction of the local environment (not only from pest species but also from non-perishable waste). Traffic between islands in archipelagos is increasing, but there is little or no recognition of the individuality of islands—some may be free of rodents or a particular invasive plant, even though these species occur elsewhere in the island group. The value of excluding an invasive plant from an as yet pest-free island is great.
Dumping of the increased amounts of waste products in landfills also provides extra colonisation sites and food for pioneer plants and animals such as rats. If these dumps lie next to harbour areas, as is often the case, this presents a prime opportunity for the spread of species such as rats, which can be so destructive to fauna and flora.
With the growth in affluence of many of the world’s nations, pursuits such as the keeping of aquaria and unusual pets have become more popular, and trade in tropical fish and invertebrates has also increased. Aquaculture facilities and the farming of aquatic organisms is becoming more widespread. It is not true that such species, imported for captive use, will always remain captive. Inevitably, some escape and find their way into streams or the ocean.
6.5 Solutions
Protocols need to be developed, explained, and distributed for use during activities such as:
(1) building construction (where the cleaning of machinery between sites is of great importance);

(2) new road construction during logging;
(3) slash and burn practices.
All of these may accelerate the spread of invasive species. Protocols are also needed for inter-island shipping, to counter rat invasions, and should cover variables such as bait stations, emergency supplies of bait, contingency plans upon discovery of rodents, freight inspection, education of passengers departing on inter-island travel, etc. This work should be developed by motivated and knowledgeable people.
The risks of transferral of invasive species within island-groups must be reduced by procedures designed to stop their spread. In Hawaii, for example, there are some very harmful invasive plants which are present on some islands, but thankfully absent from others. A lot of time and money could be saved by taking a little care to exclude these plants and yet, in general, the benefits of inter-island quarantine are not recognised.
Pest monitoring stations should be established at air and sea ports using methods which will intercept targeted “high risk” species. For example, pheromone traps would catch and indicate the presence of Asian gypsy moth and other similar species, and pitfall traps would catch ants. Permanent rat poison stations should be established first at key ports from which regular inter-island ferry services leave for rat-free islands, and secondly at the destination islands.
Whole pest-free islands, or island groups, should have reporting and contingency plans designed for them. One national contact position (person) should be made responsible for liaison with outside groups and can be “primed” to look out for new arrivals of pest species. As an extension to this, it would be helpful if in situ personnel or positions could be identified, and those people given responsibility for actively setting up new initiatives to counter invasive species. Such people could also identify key native species—the ones which are threatened by invasive species—and ensure that these are monitored so that “baseline” information on their populations is collected over the years, enabling any decline in numbers to be noticed.
In an attempt to reduce the risk of within-country spread of invasive species and other problems, it would be valuable to identify and set up possible “model projects” on islands which are recognised as having high conservation values. These projects can serve to test methods, educate others, and act as a resource to promote the value of invasive species projects. For the sake of maximum efficiency, as many projects as possible should be integrated, so
17

Invasive species in the Pacific

that work and resources are not duplicated, but are shared. Other conservation programmes, as well as quarantine and general education programmes, could have invasive species messages integrated into them.
As indicated earlier, it is important to note that the invasive species problem is a national security issue, and hence needs to be tackled using a holistic approach. Economic and human health issues are part of the problem, and should be dealt with, but without neglecting the serious impacts on native species and ecosystems. The problem has grown rapidly as trade and transport have become so fast and global, but resources to deal with the problem have not developed as quickly.
If a new species is showing invasive or harmful effects, a decision must be made about whether eradication is possible. It is important to note the technical differences between eradication and control. Eradication may be defined as the permanent removal of all individuals of a species with little or no risk of re-invasion. An eradication programme may take more than one year. However, eradication is usually designed to be a one-off operation, and hence requires detailed knowledge of the target species’ biology and lifecycle. For example, rats may be most easily removed from an island after they have just experienced a harsh season with little food. At this time they will be most willing to consume poison baits. Weather is also important. If rains are expected for a certain season, that may be precisely the wrong time to use poisons which can be broken down quickly and washed away. The initial cost of eradication is high, but if it is carefully done and effective, there will be no ongoing costs.
Control refers to ongoing reduction in numbers or density of a species to pre-determined levels. These levels will have been assessed so that the threat(s) to the conservation values (such as native species or ecosystems) can be reduced to whatever is deemed an acceptable level. In the case of weeds (and possibly other groups of invasive species) “control” has meant containing the weed species within a defined distribution. Thus ongoing control of invasive spe-

cies presents a radically different scenario from that of eradication. The decision to undertake long-term control of an invasive species should not be taken lightly. On a remote island or atoll which is rarely serviced by shipping it may be unaffordable or unsustainable. Thus control involves a continued commitment, and access to funding. It raises the potential of risks to non-target species, through the use of broadcast poison baits, for example, and, because of this environmental exposure, also leads to the possibility of resistance to toxins building up in invasive species.
In conclusion, as mentioned earlier in this paper, prevention is the most important practice, followed by eradication, and then control. Once a species is established and doing damage, its removal is mostly very difficult, expensive, and time-consuming; and usually also has some cost to the environment.

Abstract
This report reviews available information on the adverse effects of 14 alien vertebrates considered to be ‘significant invasive species’ on islands of the South Pacific and Hawaii, supplementing our own experience with that of other workers. The biological characteristics of each of these invasives are outlined together with what is known of their impacts on native plants and animals. The most widespread are goats, pigs, cattle, cats, dogs, mice, and three species of rats. Island groups are listed in alphabetical order with summary comments on their habitats, status with respect to damage by these invasives, and potential for restoration where known.
More information is needed on the impacts of invasives on indigenous species and habitats so that priorities can be decided for controlling or eradicating those posing the most serious threats. Preventing the further spread of invasive vertebrates and keeping relatively unmodified islands free of invasives are discussed. Island governments need to protect islands from further invasions for reasons of economic interest and human health as well as maintaining conservation values. A specific recommendation is made for establishing an effective strategy that will reduce or prevent further establishment of invasive animals. Suggestions are made for restoring particular islands; searches should be made to identify those islands where it appears feasible to restore and maintain indigenous vegetation and wildlife.
1. Introduction
This review of the invasive land vertebrates present on islands of the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) region is part of a larger review of the invasive plants and animals that have affected these islands adversely. Numerous alien species of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians have been introduced to this region.
Some of these have become widespread and exerted serious negative impacts on native plants and ani-

mals. These are goats, pigs, cattle, cats, dogs, three species of rats, and mice. Some other introductions either capable or potentially capable of serious negative impacts are at present restricted to a few islands. These are rabbits, brown tree snakes, mongooses, musk shrews and cane toads, all of which could be spread further by human activity. These 14 alien vertebrates are referred to in this report as “significant invasive species”. The report outlines the biological characteristics of each, their distribution among islands of the SPREP region, and what is known of their impacts on native plants and animals of these islands. We stress, however, that this list of 14 species is based on what we know at present and does not mean that other species not covered in detail are necessarily insignificant in their effects. If New Zealand had been reviewed, for example, sheep would have been included as a significant invasive species; donkeys are very significant in the Galapagos Islands; and both Hawaii and New Zealand have suffered significant conservation losses from deer. Effects of introduced birds on the native plants and animals of islands in the Region are still not clarified.
Information in this report is derived largely from searching the literature but is supplemented by direct communication with other workers in this field as well as the experience of the writers. Detailed information is lacking for some of the invasive species discussed, particularly musk shrews, cane toads, and introduced birds. Information for the islands is also uneven in detail. The checklist of islands published by Douglas (1969) has been invaluable but the naming of some islands remains unclear and some of the island areas she quoted are incorrect. We have not listed islands where we have no information on invasive species.
We are sure that many of the information gaps in the island section of this report can be filled by either communication with knowledgeable residents or through visits by an informed person. In the time available, we have not been able to find what we regard as adequate information for several groups of

19

Invasive species in the Pacific

islands: Caroline Is, Chesterfield Is, D’Entrecasteaux Reefs (northwest of New Caledonia, not to be confused with the D’Entrecasteaux Islands of eastern New Guinea), Gambier Is, Loyalty Is, Marquesas Is, Marshall Is, New Caledonia, Palau Is, Santa Cruz Is, Solomon Is, Tonga, Tuamotu archipelago, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. New Guinea and its surrounding islands are more difficult and may require communication with a larger group of people, if not a field study, to obtain a more complete picture.
Islands under French control may not have had sufficient attention because French is not our first language.
Question marks alongside dog, cat, pig, or mouse indicate that these animals are likely to be present in the island group and are likely to be free-ranging or feral. But we have not been able to find written confirmation of this belief.
We were asked to include Hawaii as a source of examples although these islands are outside the SPREP region. Impacts of invasive animals have been more extensively studied in Hawaii than elsewhere in the Pacific.
2. Ecology of significant invasive animals
2.1 Cattle (Bos taurus)
Characteristics and spread in the Pacific
Cattle of various breeds (originally native to Asia) have been introduced to a number of islands in the Pacific as the basis for a meat industry. They are particularly important in Hawaii and New Caledonia.
Impacts on conservation values
Unless well contained by adequate fences, cattle wander into native vegetation wherever suitable food is available. If unchecked this can result in the formation of feral herds roaming wild through extensive areas of country. In Hawaii, feral cattle are present in remote forests, subalpine scrub and on inaccessible lava flows (Tomich 1969). Scott et al. (in Stone 1984) regarded domestic and feral cattle as the “single most destructive agent to Hawaiian ecosystems, particularly to koa forests”. Regeneration of young koa (Acacia koa) trees is completely suppressed in some forests of Hawaii (Baldwin and Fagerlund 1943). Cattle grazing was considered to be a primary factor in the decline of an endemic leguminous vine (Vicia menziesii) on the island of Hawaii (Warshauer and Jacobi 1982). Snowcraft (1983) found that cattle browsing was more destructive to mammane (Sophora chrysophylla) forests on

Mauna Loa volcano, Hawaii, than sheep browsing. Anson visited Tinian Island, Northern Mariana Islands, in 1742 and attributed the island’s park-like scenery to overgrazing by cattle (Walter and Robins 1974). In New Caledonia, Barrau (1981) considered that open-range cattle grazing had destroyed much of the pre-colonial landscape in which savanna woodlands had been present.
Prevention/control
Well maintained fences can give adequate protection from cattle to areas of native woody vegetation. Dogs and shooting are a standard method of control.

2.2 Feral goat (Capra hircus)
Characteristics
Feral goats on Pacific islands are derived from domestic goats (originally native to Asia), introduced to an island for their milk or released as potential food for people marooned by shipwrecks. Goats usually move in groups that can build to large herds as their numbers increase. Home ranges, i.e. the areas searched for food, can vary from 100 m to 20 km in width. Males are bearded and have a strong smell during the breeding season. They do not defend territories and wander more widely than females (Rudge 1990). Studies in New Zealand show year-round breeding; a population recovering after control was able to double in about two years (Rudge and Smit 1978).
Grasslands, scrub and forest are all used extensively by goats as feeding areas. Goats particularly like open areas in which to rest or sun themselves, but at night, or in bad weather, they may seek shelter under rocky outcrops or other places where they can keep their fur dry. In Hawaii, goats are present on all main islands from low to high altitudes, where they destroy or damage communities in both dry and wet zones (Stone 1984).
Spread in the Pacific
Feral goats have become established on at least 9 island groups within the SPREP region.
Impacts on conservation values Goats have been recognised as “the single most destructive herbivore” introduced to the islands of the world (King 1985). By eating young trees in a forest they prevent the replacement of adult trees that form the forest canopy. In extreme cases, such as on

20

Atkinson and Atkinson: Land vertebrates as invasive species

Isabela Island in the Galapagos group, a mosaic of low forest and an open woodland has been replaced by grassland and depleted woodland or other kind of non-forest vegetation, within a 10-year period (F. Cruz, pers. comm.). Goats were present on Cuvier Island, east of Auckland, New Zealand, between 1910 and 1960, when they were eradicated. A 36-year study of forest recovery since the eradication showed that more than two-thirds of the tree and shrub species present had been reduced by goats, some to very low numbers. At least six other plant species on the island had probably been eliminated by goats (Atkinson, in prep.). In addition, early collections indicate that at least six plant species became extinct on the island as a result of the goats. Goat impacts of this kind have affected many other islands throughout the world, although they are seldom properly documented.
Prevention/control
Goats are extremely difficult to exclude from an area with fencing. They can be controlled effectively by hunting with dogs, or shooting from the air, but the operation must be planned carefully to ensure that conservation values most at risk from goats are protected. Removal of goats can lead to rapid recovery of suppressed vegetation on an island (Coblentz 1978). Feral goats have been eradicated from 16 New Zealand islands (Parkes 1990), the largest of which is Raoul Island (2938 ha) in the Kermadec group.

2.3 Pig (Sus scrofa)
Characteristics
Pigs (originally native to Europe), are large omnivorous mammals with powerful bodies and coarse hairy coats. Their thick necks, wedge-shaped heads and mobile snouts enable them to root up the ground when feeding. They lack the multiple stomachs found in ruminants such as cattle and goats. In New Zealand they breed throughout the year, with a litter size of 6-10 piglets, but usually only half this number survive. They reach breeding age at between 10 and 12 months (Wodzicki 1950). Pigs are normally social animals but adult boars over 18 months old are invariably solitary (McIlroy 1990).

Spread in the Pacific
Pigs have been introduced to the great majority of island groups in the Pacific. Their spread began with colonisation of these islands by Polynesian and Micronesian peoples and continued with Spanish settlement in the 17th century and the subsequent influx of other European peoples. However, pigs introduced by early seafarers have often been displaced by domestic pigs that have gone wild. Absence of records of pigs on a particular island should not be taken to mean they are not present; pigs are sometimes considered too commonplace to be remarked upon.
Impacts on conservation values
Anderson and Stone (1993) regarded feral pigs as “currently the most pervasive and disruptive alien influence on the unique native forests of the Hawaiian Islands”. Pigs damage forests by eating or uprooting tree seedlings as well as other plants with palatable leaves or stems, including ferns and some orchids (Kirk 1896). They break open tree-fern trunks in searching for starch (Griffin 1977). Savidge (1984) records damage to understoreys in the limestone forests of Guam. A secondary but very significant impact results from their consumption of the fruit of some species of invasive weed such as guava (particularly Psidium spp.); the seeds pass through the gut and into droppings, thus spreading those weeds far more rapidly. Pig damage to vegetation was recorded on Tinian Island, Northern Mariana Islands, as far back as 1742 (Walter and Robins 1974). Pigs also impact on large native invertebrates, such as earthworms and landsnails (e.g. Meads et al. 1984) by destroying their habitat, and eating their eggs, juvenile growth stages, or adults. However, as with plants, these impacts have seldom been quantified and no such studies on Pacific islands are known to us. Pigs are very effective predators of both surfaceand burrow-nesting seabirds. On subantarctic Auckland Island, south of New Zealand, pigs dig petrels from their burrows to eat them (Rudge 1976) and similarly in the Galapagos Islands on the equator, pigs dig out and consume dark-rumped petrels (Pterodroma phaeopygia) from their burrows (Coulter et al. 1985 and I. Atkinson, pers. obs.). On Christmas Island, Pacific Ocean, pigs eat eggs, nestlings and adults of sooty terns (Sterna fuscata). Moors and Atkinson (1984) concluded that pigs probably also eat the eggs and young of other surface-nesting seabirds such as albatrosses, shags and boobies, but adequate documentation is lacking.
In addition to their impact on native wildlife and native plant/animal communities, pigs adversely affect agricultural crops, including sugar cane. They also

21

Invasive species in the Pacific

damage planted forests by digging up young trees and eating their roots (McIlroy 1990). They have the potential to spread diseases to other animals, both domestic and native, and are reputed to facilitate attacks on trees by the dieback disease caused by the fungus Phytophthora cinnamomi (Auld and Tisdell 1986).
Prevention/control
Pigs are very mobile animals and their home ranges are not fixed in locality. Under stress they may disperse considerable distances. In Australia, feral pigs have been recorded moving 20 km in 48 hours when suffering from food shortage (Auld and Tisdell 1986). This mobility can mean that it is uneconomic for an individual landowner or controlling agency to control a pig population because animals destroyed are soon replaced by pigs moving in from adjacent properties. In New Zealand, pigs have been eradicated from Kapiti Island (1970 ha) and Great Mercury Island (1860 ha) as well as many smaller islands. Standard methods of control are hunting with dogs and poisoning with compound 1080. In Hawaii, snaring has been used to control pigs within 600–800 km2 fenced exclosures located in remote areas of rain forest in the Haleakala National Park, Maui (Anderson and Stone 1993).
Many people place a high cultural/food value on pigs so that removing them from designated areas may not be acceptable without a clear presentation and discussion of the benefits. Snaring would also not always be an acceptable method of control.

2.4 Dog (Canis familiaris)
Characteristics
Dogs taken to Pacific islands by the early Polynesians may have been about the size of a small collie, but shorter in the leg (Anderson 1990). They have long since been replaced by or crossed with various breeds from Europe. Dogs can range through a wide variety of habitats, whether open country or thick forest.
Spread in the Pacific
Dogs have been taken to most inhabited islands in the Pacific but the extent to which they have become feral on forested islands is unclear. R. Hay (pers. comm. 1999), for example, saw little evidence that dogs on Niue were penetrating the forest to any great degree, but this may have been because of the sharp pinnacles and cracks in the limestone substrate. On

Tinian Island, Northern Mariana Islands, feral and domestic dogs have been present since the mid-1700s (Wiles et al. 1990).
Impacts on conservation values
It is important to recognise that, even though there may be no truly feral dogs on an island, an uncontrolled domestic dog can wreak havoc among ground birds. In New Zealand, during study of kiwi in a Northland forest, the loss of 13 out of 23 kiwi fitted with transmitters was found to be a result of predation by a German shepherd dog. It was estimated that this single dog alone had killed 500 out of 900 birds, although this estimate was considered to be possibly conservative (Taborsky 1988). Seabirds are included among the prey taken by dogs. In Hawaii, Sincock and Swedberg (1969) found Newell’s shearwaters (Puffinus puffinus newellii) were subject to predation by dogs. Tomkins (1985) records dogs killing adult dark-rumped petrels (Pterodroma phaeopygia) on several islands in the Galapagos group. Remains of boobies and shearwaters were found in the stomachs and droppings of dogs on Isla Isabela, Galapagos group, by Barnett (1982).
Prevention/control
Feral packs of dogs can be hunted and shot. Control of domestic dogs is dependent on their owners knowing what native birds and other native animals are at risk from dogs on the island where they live.
Current researchers and control experts
We know of no-one who is actively researching the impact of uncontrolled domestic dogs or feral dogs on native wildlife.
2.5 House cat (Felis catus)
Characteristics
Members of the cat family feed mainly on vertebrates such as small mammals and birds. House cats live in a very wide range of habitats if food is available. They are less dependent on water than many other mammals introduced to Pacific islands because of the extent to which they obtain moisture from their food. The sizes of home ranges used by cats in searching for food vary enormously, depending on the kind of habitat (Fitzgerald and Karl 1986). In good conditions cats may have two to three litters per year, with a most common litter size of 4 kittens (Fitzgerald 1990).
Spread in the Pacific
Many ships of the 18th and 19th centuries were infested with rats and so carried cats to control them. Considering also the extent to which cats are valued

22

Atkinson and Atkinson: Land vertebrates as invasive species

as pets it is not surprising that they are possibly now present in all of the island groups considered in this report. Within an island group, however, many uninhabited islands are still free of cats.
Impacts on conservation values
Worldwide, cats prey on petrels, shearwaters and prions including seabirds as large as the black petrel (Procellaria parkinsoni) (Imber 1975, I. Atkinson, pers. obs.). They also prey extensively on landbirds, particularly those that nest or feed on or near to the ground. The only study of foods eaten by cats on islands in the SPREP region appears to be that of Kirkpatrick and Rauzon (1986) on Howland and Jarvis Islands, both of which lie close to the equator. Here cats were having a significant impact on surface-nesting seabirds by killing young and adult birds and occasionally taking eggs as well. In New Zealand their diet includes rabbits, rats, mice, birds, skinks and geckos as well as larger insects and spiders. On islands, birds are likely to be the most important food because the number of small mammals is often limited. Cats lived for over 40 years on Herekopare Island (28 ha), east of Stewart Island, where they fed mainly on seabirds but eliminated 6 species of landbird (Fitzgerald and Veitch 1985). Cats are known to have eliminated saddlebacks (Philesturnus carunculatus) from both Cuvier Island (170 ha) and Little Barrier Island (3083 ha) last century.
Prevention/control
Routine inspection of cargoes and luggage should provide adequate protection against cats reaching an island where they are not already present. Cats can be controlled by live-trapping, shooting, or killed with Victor ‘soft-catch’ leghold traps baited with tinned catfood or fish (Veitch 1985, Innes et al. 1999). Cats were eradicated from Baker Island (145 ha) in the Line group in 1964 following which the large colonies of sooty terns (Sterna fuscata) and lesser frigatebirds (Fegata ariel), which had been greatly reduced by the cats, re-established (Forsell 1982). Cats have been eradicated from quite large islands, both forested, such as Little Barrier Island (Veitch 1985), New Zealand, and those lacking forest, such as Marion Island (29 000 ha) in the Indian Ocean. Four methods were used to kill cats on Marion Island: the viral disease feline panleucopaenia, shooting, cagetraps and gin traps (Bloomer and Bester 1992).

2.6 Pacific rat (Rattus exulans)
Characteristics
Pacific rats are the smallest of the three rats closely associated with humans. Body weights are usually between 60 and 80 g, but occasionally heavier. The fur is brown and tail length is only slightly longer or shorter than the combined head and body length. A useful feature distinguishing them from other rats is the dark outer edge of the upper side of the hind foot near the ankle, the remainder of the foot being pale. In New Zealand on Tiritiri Island, litter size is usually between 4 and 9 with an average of 3 litters per year (Moller and Craig 1986). The density of these rats on an island is very dependent on the presence of cats, or other rodents, particularly mice (Taylor 1975). Pacific rats can live in a wide range of habitats including grassland, scrub and forest. They are able to climb trees easily where at least some of their feeding is done, but are not good swimmers.
Spread in the Pacific
Pacific rats originated in the Indo-Malaysian region where they are still present. They have subsequently been spread by people to numerous islands in the Pacific, particularly by Polynesians and Micronesians. Pacific rats may have been present in the Mariana Islands for at least 3500 years, introduced by the Chamorro people (Spoehr 1957). There is no evidence to suggest that this rat is native to any of the islands included in this study, as implied by Case (1996: 73). There appear to be no island groups that were reached by the Polynesians that did not receive Rattus exulans (Atkinson 1985). However, a number of islands within groups, particularly those uninhabited, are still free of it. There is some evidence to suggest that the decline of R. exulans in mainland New Zealand during the 19th century was a result of competitive exclusion by mice (Taylor 1975).
Impact on conservation values
Though considered by early naturalists a “harmless vegetarian”, this rat is harmless to neither animals nor plants. Pacific rats eat a wide range of foods including earthworms, centipedes, larvae of some butterflies and moths, ants, beetles, weevils, cicadas, snails, spiders, lizards and birds. They also eat fleshy fruit and other seeds, flowers, stems, leaves, roots and other plant parts. These facts do not in themselves prove that survival of the animal or plant species affected will necessarily be reduced significantly. However, many studies have shown that this is sometimes the case. Particular examples are the detrimental effects on burrowing petrels, described for Hawaii and New Zealand (Woodward 1972, Imber 1975)

23

Invasive species in the Pacific

and on red-tailed tropicbirds (Phaethon rubricauda) (Fleet 1972). In the Leeward Islands of Hawaii, Fleet and Woodward have shown that predation on seabirds only becomes significant after storms have reduced the fruiting of food plants. Fatal attacks by Pacific rats on adult Laysan albatrosses (Kepler 1967) appear likely to be associated with the same factor. Many species of lizard in New Zealand have been reduced in numbers, sometimes becoming locally extinct, as a result of predation by this rat (Whitaker 1973, Towns 1991). On Henderson Island, Pitcairn group, Brook (1995) recorded intense predation by R. exulans on newly hatched Murphy’s and Kermadec petrel chicks. A recent study (Campbell and Atkinson 1999) shows that in New Zealand, R. exulans has adversely affected the recruitment of at least 5 species of coastal tree, some of which are now rare.
Prevention/control
Pacific rats have been eradicated from islands of less than a hectare in size, up to the size of Kapiti island (1970 ha), near Wellington, New Zealand (Empson and Miskelly 1999). These authors discuss the risks, costs and benefits of using brodifacoum to eradicate rats. Compound 1080 has not proved effective against this rat, but they are susceptible to anticoagulent poisons such as brodifacoum and bromodialone.

2.7 Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus)
Characteristics
Also known as the brown rat, and originally from Mongolia, Norway rats are the largest of the three rats that have been dispersed by humans to the Pacific islands. Their body weight is most commonly between 200 and 300 g, but weights up to 450 g (and rarely greater) are not unusual. Their fur colour is brown with grey colours on the belly. The tail is significantly shorter than the combined head and body length, and they have a uniformly grey upper side to the hind foot. Litter size in New Zealand averages 6–8, but published information is sparse (Moors 1990). Although they do climb tree trunks and branches to some extent, they are not agile climbers in the manner of ship rats. Characteristically they nest below ground in burrows, sometimes forming quite
24

elaborate burrow systems. They are by far the best swimmers of the three rat species, sometimes diving for shellfish and other food in the intertidal zone. However, they may be more dependent on fresh water than are the other rat species.
Spread in the Pacific
Norway rats do not appear to have reached the Pacific islands until the 19th century and even now have not established on all inhabited islands in the Pacific (Atkinson 1985). Their distribution is thus more restricted than that of the other two rats, although they are almost invariably present where there is any substantial human habitation.
Impacts on conservation values
Norway rats are omnivorous and eat a wide range of plant and animal foods. They prey on the eggs, young, and sometimes adults of ground birds such as rails, ducks and wading birds (e.g. Pye and Bonner 1980, Brown 1949). Ducks, in particularly, appear to be more vulnerable to Norway rats than to other species of rat. Norway rats also eat seabirds and their eggs, including storm petrels, diving petrels, prions, shearwaters, tropicbirds, gulls, and terns (Moors and Atkinson 1984). It is probable that they have caused catastrophic declines in the numbers of ground-nesting birds on some islands, such as Campbell Island, New Zealand, but no particular case has been properly documented.
Prevention/control
Norway rats are more wary of new items in their territories, such as traps, poison-bait tunnels, than either of the other two rat species. “Second-generation” anticoagulant poisons have been used very effectively against this rat, for example, the eradication of Norway rats from Kapiti Island (1970 ha), New Zealand, in 1997 (Empson and Miskelly). The largest island from which Norway rats have been eradicated is, to date, Langara Island (Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia), 3105 hectares in area. The eradication campaign for R. norvegicus was begun (after preparation and trials) in July 1995 and the island was declared free of rats in May 1997 (Kaiser et al. 1997).
The undesirable consequences of any ongoing use of such poisons should always be considered: primary or secondary poisoning of non-target species we are aiming to protect, secondary poisoning of other vertebrate pests such as cats, and development of resistance to the poison by the rats.

2.8 Ship rat (Rattus rattus)
Characteristics
This rat was originally native to India and is also known as the black rat or roof rat. Ship rats are rather larger than Pacific rats, with body weights between 120 and 160 g although occasionally exceeding 200 g. They may be grey-brown on the back with either a similarly coloured or creamish-white belly, or they may be black all over. These three distinct colour forms can be found in rats of the same litter; they are not, as was once thought, three different subspecies. The tail is always much longer than the head and body length combined. The hind foot is uniformly coloured over the whole foot and usually dark. Litter size is 3–10, averaging 5–8 (Innes 1990), with the breeding season in New Zealand restricted to the September to April period. Ship rats are widespread in forest and woodlands as well as being able to live in and around buildings. There is nothing to support the statement by Pernetta and Watling (1978) that ship rats “are restricted in their distribution to a close association with humans”; these authors appear not to have trapped for rodents in native forest. Ship rats are extremely agile climbers, usually nest in bunches of leaves and twigs built in trees well above ground level, and spend more time searching for food in tree crowns than either of the other two introduced rats.
The work of Yosida (1980) and his co-workers has shown that there are two forms of R. rattus that differ in chromosome number. The Asian form has 42 chromosomes and is present in SE Asia and Japan. The more widespread Oceanic form has 38 chromosomes and is the ship rat of Europe, the Mediterranean region, America, Australia and New Zealand. Present indications are that it is the Oceanic form that has reached islands in the South Pacific, but studies are needed to confirm this. The Asian form has probably reached some islands north of the equator, e.g. the Caroline Islands: on the basis of colour variation in rats on Ponape and Koror Islands, described by Johnson (1962) as Rattus rattus mansorius, we suspect that these rats may be the Asian form of R. rattus.
Spread in the Pacific
Ship rats first reached the Pacific islands with early European navigators in the 17th century but apparently established on only a few islands. The major spread of this rat did not take place until after 1850 (Atkinson 1985). Among all the invasive animals covered in this report, ship rats are now second only

Impacts on conservation values
Like the other two species of rat included here, ship rats are omnivorous and capable of eating a wide range of plant and animal foods. These include native snails, beetles, spiders, moths, stick insects and cicadas and the fruit of many different plants (Innes 1990). They also prey on the eggs and young of forest birds, a behaviour long suspected in New Zealand but only proved beyond doubt comparatively recently through use of video cameras at night (Innes et al. 1999). In the recovery programme for the endangered Rarotonga flycatcher or kakerori (Pomarea dimidiata), Robertson et al.(1994) identified ship rats as the most important predator affecting the breeding success of this bird. Several cases are known where predation on seabirds can be reliably attributed to ship rats. These include sooty terns in the Seychelles Islands (Feare 1979), Bonin petrels in Hawaii (Grant et al. 1981), Galapagos dark-rumped petrels in the Galapagos Islands (Harris 1970), and white-tailed tropicbirds in Bermuda (Gross 1912).
The ship rat is the rat most frequently identified with catastrophic declines of birds on islands. The best documented examples in the Pacific region are Midway I. in the Leeward Is of Hawaii (Johnson 1945, Fisher and Baldwin 1946), Lord Howe Island (Hindwood 1940, Recher and Clark 1974) and Big South Cape Island, New Zealand (Atkinson and Bell 1973). There are undoubtedly other examples of such declines on islands which, if noticed at the time, were never documented. Atkinson (1977) brought together circumstantial evidence suggesting that ship rats, rather than disease, were responsible for the decline of many species of Hawaiian native birds during the 19th century. There are few indications of rat-induced declines in native birds on islands nearer the equator (latitude 15°N to 20°S). This zone coincides with the distribution of native land crabs, animals that also prey on birds and their eggs. The long co-existence between land crabs and some island birds may have resulted in the development of behaviours among the birds that gives them a degree of protection against rats. Atkinson (1985) suggested that this might be the reason why rat-induced catastrophes are less apparent within the equatorial zone, but this hypothesis has never been tested.
Prevention/control
“Second-generation” anticoagulant poisons are used widely for ship rat control, but possible consequences of any ongoing control should always be considered. These consequences include primary or secondary

25

poisoning of species we are aiming to protect or other non-target species, secondary poisoning of other vertebrate pests such as cats, and development of resistance to these poisons by ship rats. Eradications of ship rats have so far only been attempted on small islands (Veitch and Bell 1990) and it is not known whether their tree-climbing habits will make eradication more difficult.

2.9 House mouse (Mus musculus)
Characteristics
This well-known animal, which probably originated in Asia or Africa, is now among the most widespread of all mammals, a result of its close association with humans and the relative ease with which it can be spread in cargoes. Apart from their occupation of buildings, mice can live in a wide range of environments, from grassland to forest. In Hawaii they are abundant over a wide range of habitats from sea level to 3920 m (Tomich 1969, van Riper and van Riper 1982).
Mice can be sexually mature at 8 weeks. Litter size varies between 2 and 12 but the commonest litter sizes are 5 and 6. In more temperate climates mouse numbers fluctuate seasonally, but individual mice rarely live longer than 18 months in the wild (Murphy and Pickard 1990).
Spread in the Pacific
Mice have probably reached all inhabited islands in the Pacific as well as some uninhabited islands. Their spread into the Pacific did not begin until the arrival of Europeans.
Impacts on conservation values
The impact of feral house mice on native plants and animals has probably been underestimated on Pacific islands through lack of studies and attention to larger pest animals. Mice eat a variety of seeds, fungi, insects (including beetles and moth caterpillars), spiders and other small animals. Lizards and sometimes eggs of small birds are also taken. In a recent study, Fitzgerald et al. (in press) demonstrated significant increases in the numbers of four species of beetle,

larvae of two species of moth, and two species of spider following eradication of mice from Allports Island (16 ha), Cook Strait, New Zealand. After mice were eradicated from Mana Island (217 ha), New Zealand, the endangered McGregor’s skink (Cyclodina macgregori) increased significantly and more Cook Strait giant wetas (Deinacrida rugosa), a large flightless grasshopper, were caught in lizard traps (Newman 1994). On subantarctic Antipodes Island (2025 ha), SE of New Zealand, M.J. Imber (in Moors and Atkinson 1984), found mice to be eating eggs of grey-backed storm petrels (Garrodia nereis), although it is not known whether this was having a significant effect on the petrel population.
Prevention/control
In the wild, mice can be controlled with anti-coagulant poisons such as brodifacoum. In New Zealand, mice have been eradicated from a few islands, most notably Mana Island (217 ha), for which details are given by Hook and Todd (1992), and Enderby Island (710 ha) in the Auckland Islands group.

2.10 Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus)
Characteristics
Rabbits are small herbivorous mammals weighing between 1 and 2 kg. Like rats and mice, they have a pair of sharp cutting teeth that grow continuously throughout life. Their droppings, when produced at night, are fibrous pellets. However, during the day the droppings are soft and are eaten, thus allowing the animal to extract the maximum value from its food. A female rabbit can produce up to 50 young in one year, but where rainfall is erratic, as on many islands, breeding is restricted to periods following rain. Young rabbits grow rapidly and can start breeding between 3 and 4 months of age (Gibb and Williams 1990).
Rabbits thrive best where rainfalls are less than 1000 mm and where the vegetation is short, preferably grazed. Although usually an animal of open country, in New Zealand rabbits have survived in low numbers on a few forested islands where the forest is low and not very dense.

26

Atkinson and Atkinson: Land vertebrates as invasive species

Spread in the Pacific
Two thousand years ago rabbits were confined to Spain and Portugal but they have since been spread by people to many parts of the world. Sailing ships of the 18th and 19th centuries sometimes carried live rabbits for food. If put ashore for shipwrecked people they usually died out, but they persisted on some islands to cause great damage to native vegetation, especially on islands of low rainfall. Rabbits have reached at least five of the island groups considered in this study. Their worldwide distribution is given by Flux and Fullager (1983).
Impacts on conservation values
Rabbits reached Laysan Island in the Hawaiian group at the beginning of the 20th century. Between 1903 and 1923 (when they were eradicated) rabbits apparently eliminated 26 species of plants, a rate of loss exceeding one species per year (Christophersen and Caum 1931). A subsequent visit by Lamoureaux (1963) indicates that not all of these species became extinct on Laysan Island; presumably regeneration from seed had been possible. Prior to their eradication, rabbits were the only introduced mammal on Phillip Island in the Norfolk Island group. There the average rate of extinction of plant species between 1830 and 1977 was approximately one species every 10 years (Fullager 1978). Extensive soil erosion frequently follows the loss of plant cover that results from browsing by rabbits, as was the case with both these islands. Thus, apart from the plant losses, rabbits often destroy the habitat of many small animals. Rabbits can also become additional food for animals such as cats, enabling these predators to increase their numbers and thus eat more native animals, including lizards and birds. This is an example of a flow-on effect, where the introduction of one problem animal results in an increase of another invasive species already established. Such an effect is believed to be the reason why the parakeet of Macquarie Island, in the subantarctic ocean NE of the Ross Dependency, became extinct following the introduction of rabbits. The bird had managed to survive in the presence of cats on the island for many years previous to the arrival of rabbits (Taylor 1979).
Prevention/control
Accidental introduction of rabbits to an island is unlikely. They are relatively easy to detect in cargo or baggage and strict surveillance at ports of entry will prevent most attempts to introduce this animal. Where rabbits are present with other grazing animals, removal of the latter will often result in the growth of rank vegetation unsuitable for rabbits; this can be used as a method of partial rabbit control. Shooting

of rabbits is an inefficient method of control but unlike poisoning it does not kill predators of rabbits such as cats. In New Zealand, poisoning has most often been carried out with compound 1080 added to carrots or oats and spread from the air. In 1998, a virus, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD, formerly called RCD), was introduced to the country illegally. In some areas it has killed many rabbits, but whether it will continue to be effective in the long-term is doubtful. Myxomatosis, a contagious and often lethal disease specific to rabbits is sometimes suggested for rabbit control. This not only requires flea or mosquito vectors but causes considerable suffering to the animals affected. Furthermore, eradication by such means is unlikely. We would not recommend use of either RHD or myxomatosis on Pacific islands. On small islands, acute poisons such as phosphorus, cyanide, strychnine and compound 1080 are all likely to kill non-target species. Second-generation anticoagulant poisons such as brodifacoum have been used successfully against rabbits although precautions are often necessary to protect non-target species (Flux 1993). Flux (1993) examined the relative effectiveness of various methods of rabbit control using a sample of 607 islands distributed throughout the world. He found that more islands had been cleared of rabbits by traditional methods of trapping, shooting, and poisoning than by introduced predators, competitors, or disease.
Rabbits have been eradicated from a number of islands including Enderby Island (710 ha) in the Auckland Islands group, Phillip Island (190 ha) in the Norfolk Island group and Round Island (151 ha), Mauritius. Both the Enderby Island and Round Island campaigns used brodifacoum as Talon 20P® baits. Merton (1987) gives details of the Round Island operation including bait preference and acceptance trials, and tolerance of reptiles to the anticoagulant poison used.

2.11 Small Indian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus)
Characteristics
The small Indian mongoose is an agile light brownish-grey animal with short legs, small rounded ears, and an adult length (including the 26 cm bushy tail)

27

Invasive species in the Pacific

of about 65 cm. It was introduced to many islands in the West Indies from 1872 onwards with the intention of controlling rats in sugar-cane fields. In 1883 it was introduced to several of the larger Hawaiian islands for the same reason. They are agile animals and are known for their attacks on chickens as well as native animals. Mongooses can live in both dry and wet conditions including forest, scrub, grassland and gardens.
Spread in the Pacific
In the SPREP region, the mongoose appears to be restricted to Fiji, where it was introduced in 1883, again with the expectation that they would control rats in sugar-cane fields.
Impacts on conservation values
Mongooses are generally solitary and hunt small animals by day. They have been seen to climb trees in Hawaii, and remains of forest birds have been found in their gut contents. The frequency and thus the significance of this behaviour has yet to be assessed (C. Hodges, pers. comm. 1999). In addition to birds, they prey on all kinds of terrestrial vertebrates as well as a wide variety of invertebrates: moths, grasshoppers, beetles, wasps, flies and spiders (Baldwin et al. 1952, Seaman and Randall 1962, Gorman 1975,) but the extent of this impact has not been measured. On some islands they have had a major effect on native snakes and diurnal lizards, i.e. those feeding during the daytime. Case and Bolger (1991) compared lizard abundance on a number of Pacific islands with and without mongooses and found a nearly 100-fold reduction of lizards where mongooses were present. In the Virgin Islands, in the Caribbean, mongooses caused the near-extinction of the ground-nesting quail dove (Geotrygon mystacea) (Nellis and Everard 1983) and in the Virgin Islands National Park, a study by Small (1982) showed that 23% of the eggs and hatchlings of hawkesbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) were destroyed by mongooses. In Hawaii, mongooses are known to eat the young of the endangered Hawaiian crow (Giffen 1983 in Stone 1984) and both eggs and incubating females of the nene goose (Banko 1982). Wherever mongooses have come in contact with the endangered Hawaiian dark-rumped petrel (Pterodroma phaeopygia) they have eliminated it (Baldwin et al. 1952). On Viti Levu in Fiji, there is circumstantial evidence for implicating mongooses in the decline of several species of ground-dwelling birds (Pernetta and Watling 1978).
Mongooses are also implicated in the spread of strawberry guava and other alien plants by eating fruit and thus dispersing seeds (Baldwin et al. 1952).

Prevention/control
On the island of St John, US Virgin Islands, Coblentz and Coblentz (1985) trapped mongooses using 15 x 15 x 45 cm live traps and fresh bait. They concluded that, where eradication of mongooses is not possible, protection of vulnerable insular species can be achieved with intensive localised trapping. Live traps are also used to capture mongooses and avoid loss of non-target species in Haleakala National Park, Hawaii (C. Hodges, pers. comm. 1999). We are not aware of any attempts to eradicate mongooses.

2.12 Musk shrew (Suncus murinus)
Characteristics
This animal, also known as the house shrew, is a native of NE Africa, SE Asia, the Philippines and Indonesia. It is small, secretive and mouse-like with a long pointed nose. They are generally solitary and have a high metabolic rate necessitating frequent feeding. Foods include a wide range of invertebrates, but they scavenge for other foods.
Spread in the Pacific
Musk shrews are common in villages and farmyards throughout the warmer parts of eastern Asia and on many of the islands fringing that coast (Johnson 1962). Within the SPREP region, they appear to have been recorded only from Guam, Palau, and the Northern Mariana Islands. They were first detected on Guam in 1953 and had spread over most of the island within three years (Peterson 1956).
Impacts on conservation values
Musk shrews are omnivorous, taking mainly insects, but also take carrion. They are reported to have killed small birds in captivity (Barbehenn 1962, Lance 1976), and are likely to eat skinks (Barbehenn 1974). In searching for underground prey they can excavate holes using their pointed nose. No studies of the impact of musk shrews on native fauna and flora are known to us. Barbehenn (1962) considered that shrews were potential predators of mice and young rats.
Prevention/control
Sodium monofluoroacetate (compound 1080) was used unsuccessfully against musk shrews in an attempt to eradicate them from the small island of

2.13 Brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis)
Characteristics
The brown tree snake is slender, nocturnal, commonly 0.9–1.2 m in length, and is secretive and arboreal, hunting for food at all levels within a forest (Fritts 1988, McCoid 1991).
Spread in the Pacific
This snake, native to Australia, Indonesia, New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, was accidentally introduced to Guam, Mariana Islands, in the late 1940s. It has now spread to a further 10 central and South Pacific islands including Wake Island (before 1955), Saipan, Tinian, Rota, Kwajalein and Pohnpei (Bech 1995).
Impacts on conservation values
A comprehensive study of this snake’s impact on a native bird fauna was made by Savidge (1987) and her co-workers (Savidge et al. 1992) on the island of Guam. She concluded that, between 1963 and 1986, predation of eggs, nestlings and adults resulted in declines or extinctions of 10 of the 11 species of native forest bird previously present. Brown tree snakes also eat small mammals and lizards. On Guam, consumption of these foods allowed the snake to reach high population densities thus increasing their impact on birds. Juvenile tree snakes prey predominantly on lizards and this effect has resulted in the extinction on Guam of three species of skink and two species of gecko (T.H. Fritts in Case and Bolger 1991). The cultural, economic and health effects of this snake, as well as secondary effects on Guam’s fauna and flora, are discussed by McCoid (1991).
Prevention/control
Tree snakes can hide easily in ships moving between islands, but the principal way they are currently being dispersed to islands is in aircraft cargoes. Several tree snakes have been detected at Honolulu airport in recent years. Preventing their further spread depends on maintaining very strict cargo checks of boats and searches at airports at all times. An effective control method is not yet available. Efforts are being made to develop artificial attractants, while snake barriers have been used in some situations, and

detector dogs are also being used in the Northern Mariana Islands (Perry 1998). The Global Invasive Species Programme is fostering cooperative effort among experts in Guam, Australia, Hawaii and mainland USA in an effort to combat this pest. In 1995 the brown tree snake was listed by the US Department of Agriculture as “among the top three pests requiring control and eradication.”

2.14 Cane toad (Bufo marinus)
Characteristics
This large toad produces glandular secretions that are poisonous to some animals. In Fiji, viable populations of this species are restricted to the flatter coastal areas. Pernetta and Watling (1978) suggest that this may be because this toad has a free-swimming tadpole stage liable to be swept away during the flash floods characteristic of montane areas. Nevertheless, large adult cane toads are present in lowland forests.
Spread in the Pacific
The cane toad is native to Mexico and Central America but has been introduced to Hawaii, Fiji, Samoa, Guam, the Northern Marianas, and the Caroline and Solomon Islands groups. These introductions were made as early attempts to use biological control against various beetle pests of sugar cane, banana and other cash crops (Hinkley 1962).
Impacts on conservation values
The major items of diet are insects, including grasshoppers, caterpillars, and ants, together with millipedes and landsnails (Hinkley 1962). Hinkley considered that cane toads would eat “almost any terrestrial animal”, although more likely to consume those active at ground level during the night. Toads have been implicated in the decline of populations of monitor lizards in Guam (Jackson 1962, Dryden 1965). Pernetta and Watling (1978) consider that the toads do not interact with native frogs because they use different habitats; the frogs are either along stream banks or in the foliage of dense forest. Villadolid (1956) found rats and mice in stomachs of toads in the Philippine Islands. Hinkley concluded that this toad is “economically neutral” because it consumes both “harmful” and “beneficial” invertebrates. No proper studies of the effects of cane toads on native fauna appear to have been made.

2.15 Introduced birds
The numbers of introduced birds that have established on islands in the Pacific can be compared in Table 1. The Hawaiian Islands are quite exceptional with respect to both attempted and successful introductions. The red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus) was spread widely on Pacific islands by Polynesians, but is apparently the only bird introduced by pre-European people.
The most widespread bird introduced to the SPREP region in European times is the common myna (Acridotheres tristis) *, native to India and south-east Asia. It is now established in islands of the Fiji, Cook, Tubuai, Society, Marquesas, Solomon and New Caledonia groups, Samoa and possibly Vanuatu (Lever 1987). R. Hay (pers. comm.) reports that this species reached Wallis Island for the first time in 1999, suggesting that common mynas are still spreading. Jungle mynas (A. fuscus) *, also native to India and south-east Asia, are established in Fiji and Samoa (Long 1981), and have apparently colonised Tonga in the early 1980s without human assistance (Rinke 1986). On Upolu Island, Samoa, Gill (1999) has recorded that jungle mynas are apparently being replaced by common mynas, the latter species having been first recorded in Samoa in 1988 (Beichle 1989). Both species are perceived as problems, at least to commercial crops.
Two other introduced birds are moderately widespread on islands in the region. The red-vented bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer), native to the Indian sub-continent, is established in Fiji, Tonga and possibly Tahiti (Lever 1987) and Samoa; the common waxbill (Estrilda astrild) is in New Caledonia and the Society Islands (Long 1981). The bulbul is seen as a potential problem for some native birds, particularly the Tahiti flycatcher (R. Hay, pers. comm.) whereas the waxbill is not.
Potential effects of birds introduced to an island include: effects on native birds, or other animals, through competition for the same foods or for nest sites; introduction of diseases against which the na-
* Pernetta and Watling (1978) appear to have interchanged the scientific names of common (Indian) mynas with jungle mynas in one table (p. 240).

tive birds have no resistance; predation on native birds by eating adults, young or eggs. Occasionally they may hybridise with a native bird to which they are related and change both the appearance of the native bird and the way in which it lives. The best documented example of hybridisation in the Pacific region concerns mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Their hybridisation with grey ducks (A. superciliosa) in New Zealand (Rhymer et al. 1994), Hawaiian ducks (A. wyvilliana) in Hawaii (Griffin et al. 1989), and an endemic race of the Pacific spot-billed duck (A. poecilorhynchos) in the Mariana Islands (Riechel and Lemke 1994) have either threatened or replaced each of these endemic forms.
Pernetta and Watling (1978) considered the question of food competition between introduced and native birds in Fiji. They pointed to the separation of native birds from those introduced that results from the almost exclusive use of native forest by non-predatory native landbirds. This separation led them to conclude that interspecific competition was relatively unimportant in the majority of cases.
However, no in-depth studies of possible negative interactions between introduced birds and native animals (including birds) appear to have been made on islands in the region. There can be no doubt that such interactions sometimes occur.

Atkinson and Atkinson: Land vertebrates as invasive species

Byrd (1979) records significant predation by common mynas on the eggs of wedge-tailed shearwaters (Puffinus pacificus) in Hawaii. Heather and Robertson (1996) record common mynas eating eggs and chicks of landbirds in New Zealand. Mynas are present in the habitat of kakerori (Pomarea dimidiata) on Rarotonga, but a study of this bird’s breeding success (Saul et al. 1998) found no evidence of mynas causing nesting failures.
The possibility that common mynas and red-vented bulbuls cause some native birds to abandon their nests (Gaze 1998), at least in intermediate secondary forest or forest margin environments, should be investigated.
There are other examples of introduced birds having negative effects on native species. The New Caledonian crow (Corvus moneduloides) was introduced to Mare in the Loyalty Islands, where it caused considerable losses of pigeons by killing their young and eggs (Delacour 1966). In Palau, the endangered Rock Island palm (Galubia palauensis) is attacked by the introduced sulphur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua galerita) which chews through and topples the crown shaft (Owen 1978). On Tetiaroa Island, Tahiti, Thibault (1976) records the introduced harrier (Circus aeruginosus = C. approximans) as preying on white terns. There are probably more examples either unrecorded or unknown to us.
3. Islands
This section is arranged alphabetically, by and within each island group. Islands are included if we have information on invasive species present. Geographic details of islands are from Douglas (1969), unless otherwise stated. A summary of significant invasive animals is given in Table 2.

Norway rat – introduced pre-1887. Present in considerable numbers: “had evidently cleared out the small native rats, found in hordes on most of the Central Pacific Islands; and no doubt accounted for the comparative absence of sea birds” (Ellis 1936: 26). “Bird life [is] … much less abundant on Baker than on other similar islands in the Central Pacific,
32

due to the presence of large voracious Norway rats … “(Bryan 1942). The rats subsist on eggs and small birds, terns, and noddies (Hague 1862, Bryan 1942).
Cat - implied introduction time of 1942–44 (Forsell 1982). In 1964 the last of a small cat population was removed by the Pacific Ocean Biological Survey

Atkinson and Atkinson: Land vertebrates as invasive species

Program (POBSP). There has been a spectacular recovery of the seabird population since removal of cats (Forsell 1982). However, King (1973) reports that in 1966 after a visit by the US military, at least two cats reappeared on the island. It is unclear whether cats are present today.
Howland
Also called Worth I. after Captain Worth of the whaleship Oeno, when he found the island in 1922. Then named after the lookout who first saw the island from the New Bedford whaler Isabella, in 1842 (Ellis 1936). Polynesian remains on the island (Emory 1934). An airstrip and lighthouse were built, intended for use by Amelia Earhart (King 1973: 100).
1.9 km2 (0.73 sq. mi.). Atoll with one island, no lagoon. Dry. Worked for guano late last century. Occupied by US before and during war, until attacked by Japanese in 1942 (Douglas 1969). Little sign of human occupancy (King 1973: 100).
Significant invasive land vertebrates
Cat (King 1973), Pacific rat (Douglas 1969, Hague 1862).
The Pacific rat, R. exulans, has been so numerous as to cause distress to persons living on the island (Bryan 1942). Ellis (1936: 24) reports that it is the worst place in their experience for the Pacific rat. Natives occasionally had soles of feet eaten by them while asleep. “Round the labourers’ quarters at dusk the ground was literally alive with them” (Ellis 1936: 24).
Hague (1862) spent several months there between 1859 and 1861. He noted that rats were about as numerous as the birds, and were very small, hardly larger than a mouse. He caught over 100 per night for many nights, and over 3300 were killed by a few men in one day.
Cats were introduced by colonists, extirpated by POBSP in 1964, reappeared in 1966 after a visit by the US Military (King 1973). Thus, the present population of house cats was introduced in 1966, and must have had great impact on rat numbers, for Kirkpatrick and Rauzon (1986: 73,74) state: “Mammals other than cats were not observed during cat collection activities on Howland Island”, and no rat remains were found in cat stomachs.
Opportunities for island restoration
“Baker has excellent potential as a seabird colony, but it is kept nearly devoid of birds by the presence of at least two cats” (King 1973: 100).
Howland “would quickly become among the most significant colonies in the central pacific if the cats were removed and the island were given protection from disturbance” (King 1973: 100).

Caroline Islands (Federated States of Micronesia - USA)
(70 islands in group)
Robertson (1877: 48, 53) commented in relation to the Yap group: “Pigs are plentiful, and there is also a kind of half domesticated fowl which can be procured cheaply. Deer and goats are seen, but the natives do not protect them, as they destroy their plantations…. The number of rats on these islands is almost beyond belief, and they are so tame that when the people are eating they come and sit round them waiting for any morsels that fall. The houses are built without sides, being merely roofed, and the supports are carefully smoothed down to prevent the rats climbing up and eating the provisions which are stored away on shelves above”.
Significant invasive land vertebrates
Cattle, goat, pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, Norway rat, ship rat, mouse, cane toad.
Also: Micronesian deer (Rusa marianna) [?now called Rusa deer Cervus timorensis], Rattus tanezumi (Flannery 1995), monitor lizard (Johnson 1962: 37), red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) (Buden 1996).
Writing of the east Caroline islands, including Pohnpei (Ponape) and Pingelap, Jackson (1962) states: “Domestic pigs, carabao, and cats have arrived since contact with the Western world was first established in 1529; and some have found their way into the forest and become feral. The several breeds of cattle and goats present are not common, and none is feral. Horses were introduced at one time but did not survive. Dogs were introduced by the Micronesians. … The monitor lizard (Varanus indicus) introduced in the hope that it would control rats, became established, and is reported to have been common and widespread for some time. However, it is now relatively scarce and restricted to a few areas on Ponape. It exercises no conspicuous control on the rats but damages domestic chickens…. The giant toad (Bufo marinus), native to Mexico and Central America, has been a highly successful introduction on many islands across the Pacific … and is present on Ponape in all areas except reef islets. … its introduction is said to have been made in the hope of controlling the monitor lizard. The monitor is reported to have declined on Guam following the introduction of the toad, and it may have declined on Ponape also …”
Archaeological study by Steadman and Intoh (1994) suggests that around nine seabirds and three landbirds are extinct on Fais Island, Yap State.

Invasive species in the Pacific

Ant 1.8 km2 (0.7 sq. mi.). Atoll with several small islets. Visited for copra collection. Pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, ship rat (Marshall 1962, Johnson 1962, Buden 1996a).
Also: Red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) (Buden 1996a).
“I saw rats frequently … on nearly every island [islet?] from Nikalap Aru westward to Pamuk, but none on Wolouna and Pasa, which apparently are the only rodent-free islands” (see Buden 1996a: 33 for more detail).
Probably feral cats (Buden 1996a: 33).
“I observed about 30 semiferal pigs on Nikalap Aru …” (Buden 1996a: 34).
Ifaluk 1.5 km2 (0.57 sq. mi.). Atoll with 3 islets. Falarik and Falalap are inhabited, Ella not. Pacific rat. Another species of rat? (see Burrows and Spiro 1953).
Also: Monitor lizard.
Bates and Abbott (1958) comment: “… of the animals on Ella, the rats made the strongest impression on me. ….The rats, once one started to notice them, were everywhere, in overwhelming numbers. These rats … are one of the great plagues everywhere in Polynesia and Micronesia. They were present on Falarik and Falalap … but the numbers on Ella were really fantastic.”
The Japanese introduced monitor lizards to Ifaluk to help control rats, but monitors were not established on Ella at the time of Bates and Abbott’s (1958) visit. They comment that after seeing Ella: “I was ready to believe that they [monitor lizards] might be responsible for the relative scarcity of rats on the main islands.”
Kapingamarangi 1.3 km2 (0.5 sq. mi.). Atoll with 33 islets. 3 largest inhabited by Polynesian population. Cat. Pacific rat - present but uncommon on the densely populated islets of Toutou and Wema where cats are said to be keeping them under control (Niering 1956).
Kusaie/Kosrae 110 km2 (42.33 sq. mi.). High volcanic, 628 m (2061'), reef. Inhabited and coastal plain cultivated. Pacific rat, ship rat (Marshall 1962). Ship rat introduced pre-1931? (Koroia 1934).
Also: Rattus tanezumi (Flannery 1995).
“When the Japanese took over the islands, a period of extreme exploitation began” (Mayr 1945a). Many
34

sources give rats as the reason for extinction of the Kusaie starling (Aplonis sp.): “A handsome, glossy black starling … is thought to have been exterminated by rats that came ashore on Kusaie from whaling ships in the 19th century (Austin 1961). “Two species, a rail and a starling, were extirpated from Kusaie Island between 1828 and 1880. Both were confined to that island …” (Greenway 1967).
Kusaie crake and Kusaie starling both extinct 1828 (King 1981).
Lamotrek/Nomatik 1 km2 (0.38 sq. mi.) Atoll with three islets. Mouse, introduced pre-1931 (Koroia 1934).
Mokil 1.3 km2 (0.5 sq. mi.) Atoll with three main islets, densely populated. Pacific rat (Johnson 1962, Marshall 1962).
Mortlock Pacific rat (R.H. Taylor, letter 1982).
Namoluk Pigs, dogs, cats, Pacific rat, ship rat (Marshall 1975).
“Rats occur in great abundance on the three largest islets, … Trapping efforts in 1971 gave credence to local stories claiming Lukan Islet to be rat-free” (Marshall 1975). Rats are present on Umap Islet – possibly all ship rat. On the main atoll both Pacific rat and ship rat are present (Marshall 1975).
Oroluk 0.5 km2 (0.2 sq. mi.). Atoll with ring of small islets. Ship rat (Marshall 1962, Johnson 1962).
Pakin 1 km2 (0.42 sq. mi.). Atoll with at least 5 islets. Pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat (Buden 1996b)
Also: Monitor lizard, red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) (Buden 1996b).
“…the islanders say feral cats are widespread…” (Buden 1996b: 46).
“Pigs … are common on the larger islands, being absent only from the Tomwena group and the tiny scrub-covered islets on the eastern end of the atoll. They are allowed to roam free over the islands, and I saw two swimming across the channel between Karot (an uninhabited island) and Osetik” (Buden 1996b: 47).
Pingelap 1.7 km2 (0.66 sq. mi.). Atoll with 2 islands and one islet. Densely populated. Pacific rat (Marshall 1962, Johnson 1962).

Atkinson and Atkinson: Land vertebrates as invasive species

Ponape/Pohnpei Very high numbers of whalers visited the island between 1824 and 1860, mostly from America. In 1858, 50–60 whaleships were visiting Ponape each year (Hezel 1979). 334 km2 (129 sq. mi.). High volcanic, 791 m (2595'), reef islets and lagoon islets. Lowland cultivated. Pacific rat, Norway rat (introduced pre-1932), ship rat (introduced pre-1932), mouse (introduced pre1932) (Koroia 1934, Marshall 1962, Johnson 1962).
Also: Rattus tanezumi (Flannery 1995).
Truk (Moen) 19 km2 (7.25 sq. mi.). High volcanic, 370 m (1215'). Admin. centre. Douglas (1969) recommends protection of savanna areas. Pacific rat, ship rat (introduced pre-1932), mouse (Koroia 1934, Marshall 1962, Johnson 1962). Musk shrew (introduced pre-1967) (Barbehenn 1974: 46).
Also: Rattus tanezumi (Flannery 1995).
Ulithi 4.7 km2 (1.8 sq. mi.). Atoll with 40 islets in 4 main groups. Is the largest atoll (but not island) in the Carolines. Used by US during WWII. Pacific rat (probably) (Lessa 1961), ship rat (introduced pre-1931) (Koroia 1934, Marshall 1962).
Also: Rattus tanezumi (Flannery 1995).

vessel to visit “surveyed the island and prepared a map in 1939”.
Total area: < 1000 ha. Coral. Largest islet is Longue I., and was the only one visited by Cohic: “a narrow tongue of sand, approximately 1800 m long and 130 m wide…”
These islands “are at the junction of several biogeographic regions, Australian, New Caledonian and New-Hebridean”. (See Cohic (1959) for a surprisingly extensive survey of flora and fauna, considering the duration of the visit.)
Significant invasive land vertebrates
None.
“The land fauna of Longue Island is very small. There are no mammals, amphibians or land reptiles. The few groups represented are birds, turtles – which come on land to lay eggs, sea snakes, a few Arachnida and insects” (Cohic 1959: 4).
Opportunities for island restoration
Removal of the extraordinary botanical introductions made during Cohic's 1957 visit: “During our short visit to Longue Island, a few plants were introduced by the Service d'Agriculture of New Caledonia. These were: coconuts, Araucaria columnaris (Forst.) Hook., Sesbania grandiflora Pers. and Leucaena glauca (L.) Benth.” (Cohic 1959: 4).

Wolea/Woleai 4.5 km2 (1.75 sq. mi.). Atoll with 21 islets. Pacific rat (Koroia 1934).
Yap 56.2 km2 (21.68 sq. mi.). Volcanic, 176 m (579'), reef. Much disturbed and cultivated. Pig, Pacific rat, Norway rat (introduced pre-1947), ship rat (introduced pre-1931) (Koroia 1934, Hartmann 1947). Mouse (introduced pre-1931).
Opportunities for island restoration Possibly one of the islets of Kapingamarangi.
Wolouna and Pasa [?islets of Ant] are apparently rodent-free (see Buden 1996a:33).
Chesterfield Islands (France) (11 islets)
Cohic (1959) reports a 4-hour visit made to these islands in 1957, commenting: “There was a complete lack of information on these islands, so it was obvious that a visit would be fruitful.” The islands are situated halfway between Australia and New Caledonia, “completely uninhabited and isolated from shipping routes, and avoided as a danger to navigation” (Cohic 1959: 1). Cohic believes that the last French

Cook Islands (New Zealand) (15 islands in two groups - Southern and Northern)
Total area: 241 km2 (93 sq. mi.). Southern Cook Islands – volcanic, and Northern Cook Islands – atolls. Fruit growing: citrus, bananas, pineapples, etc.; also copra.
Significant invasive land vertebrates Goat, pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, ship rat, Norway rat, mouse. Indian myna.
Pigs reported as only significant invasives on Manuae (E.K. Saul, pers. comm. 1999).
“Rats (species unknown) were believed by Mr Tama and Mr Turer to be a problem to a greater or lesser extent to the copra crops on Penrhyn, Manihiki, Rakahanga, Pukapuka, Nassau, Aitutaki, Mitiaro and possibly Atiu. Mangos on Aitutaki, Atiu, Mauke and Rarotonga and pineapples on Atiu and Mangaia were also stated to be troubled by rodents” (Daniel 1978).
Three bird species introduced. At least 10 bird species extinct (Case 1996: 71).
Indian myna present on: Aitutaki, Atiu, Mangaia, Manuae and islets of Manuae and Auotu, Mauke, Rarotonga (Lever 1987: 499, following Holyoak and Thibault 1984).

Invasive species in the Pacific

Southern Cook Islands
Aitutaki/Aitutake
Discovered by Bligh in the Bounty, 1789. Effective contact began with arrival of first missionaries in October 1821. Two whaling ships wrecked in 1847. Party of 900 US Marines and 400 negroes present from 1942 to 1944 (Stoddart 1975). 18 km2 (7 sq. mi., 4461 acres). Main island volcanic, 137 m (450'), including 13 reef islets. Large lagoon. Fertile. Citrus, banana, cocunuts, tomatoes grown.
?Cat, Pacific rat, Norway rat, ship rat, mouse. Indian myna (Lever 1987: 499).
Introduction time/spread - Skeletal material of R. exulans and Mus musculus collected from the island by Marples in 1956, but no R. norvegicus or R. rattus (Marples 1955). In 1963, R. exulans, R. norvegicus and R. rattus trapped on island (Alicata and McCarthy 1964).
Rats a problem to copra crop, mangoes also troubled by rodents (Daniel 1978).
“Six archaeological sites up to 1000 years old on Aitutaki … have yielded bones of 15 species of birds, five of which no longer occur on the island … Of these, only [two] survive anywhere in the Cook Islands today” (Steadman 1991). Mammals found include Pacific rat, dog, pig (Steadman 1991: 328).
Pauline McColl (pers. comm.) says this is the only island where lorikeet (the nun bird) breeds.
Atiu
Discovered by Cook in 1777. 28 km2 (10.9 sq. mi., 6654 acres). Central volcanic plateau, 91 m (300'), surrounded by mile wide makatea (elevated reef limestone). Fringing reef. Citrus fruit, coffee.
Rats present (species unknown). Indian myna (Lever 1987: 499).
Mangoes and pineapples troubled by rodents (Daniel 1978).
Mangaia
Discovered by Cook in 1777. 51.8 km2 (20 sq. mi.) (Merlin 1991: 131). Low volcanic. Swamps. Intensive cultivation. Main settlement on makatea (elevated reef limestone), pineapple growing on volcanic areas.
?Cat, Pacific rat, ship rat (Alicata and McCarthy 1964). Indian myna (Lever 1987: 499).
No dogs or pigs in pre-European times (Heyerdahl 1952).
One Norway rat arrived 1852, and was trapped:
“In many of the islands the indigenous breed has been exterminated by the imported rat. In 1852 a solitary male R. norvegicus got ashore from a wreck at

Mangaia, and made war on the native rat, 30 of these were found dead under the floor of a room; the R. norvegicus was eventually trapped (Gill 1876: 316). In 1963, R. rattus trapped on Mangaia (Alicata and McCarthy 1964).
Rats feed on “cocoa-nuts, bananas, arrow-root, candlenuts, and papas apples” (Gill 1876: 317). Pineapples troubled by rodents (Daniel 1978).
“On the island of Mangaia … only 2 species of land bird exist today; I have found fossil evidence of 8 extinct species” (Steadman and Zousmer 1988), including 2 species of flightless rail (Steadman 1987).
Rats trapped, singed baked and eaten. A common expression when speaking of anything delicious: “It is as sweet as a rat” (Williams 1839).
Manuae (Hervey)
Discovered by Cook in 1773. 6 km2 (2.3 sq. mi., 1524 acres). Atoll with twin islets. Closed lagoon, almost totally covered by coconut plantation.
Pig. Rats present (species unknown). Only Pacific rat? “Manuae – almost certainly R. exulans” (W.R. Sykes, letter, 1982). Indian myna - also present on islets of Manuae and Auotu (Lever 1987: 499).
Pigs reported as significant invasives on Manuae (E.K. Saul, pers. comm. 1999).
Mauke
Discovered by the Rev. John Williams in 1823. 18 km2 (7.1 sq. mi., 4552 acres). Low volcanic, 30 m (100'), surrounded by ring of makatea (elevated reef limestone), swampy zone between volcanics and limestone. Fringing reef. Well wooded. Citrus fruit, peanuts grown.
Cat, pig, goat, dog (all introduced 1823–25). Pacific rat only? Indian myna (Lever 1987: 499).
Bloxam (1925) saw many rats “running about the woods” in daylight. Was estimated that on Mauke, “80 per cent of the coconuts are lost through rat damage” (Iyengar and Menon 1957). Pauline McColl (pers. comm. 1985) just returned from a visit to Mauke – “locals say only the small rat is there”.
A starling Aplonis mavornata, and fruit dove Ptilinopus rarotongensis cf. goodwini, collected by Bloxam in 1925, presumably now extinct (Olson 1986).
Mitiaro 22 km2 (8.6 sq. mi., 5500 acres). Low volcanic core, surrounded by lake and swamp complex. Small amount of cultivated land.
Rats present, probably Pacific rat (W.R. Sykes, letter 1982).
Rats a problem to copra crop (Daniel 1978).

Palmerston
Discovered by Cook in 1774. Palmerston is 434 km (270 miles) from Rarotonga, intermediate in postion between the “northern” and “southern” Cooks.
2.59 km2 (1 sq. mi., 500 acres). Atoll with lagoon and 8 islets. Well wooded with some native vegetation. Copra production?
Pacific rat? (Observed by Anderson in 1777) (Beaglehole, no date: 851).
Rarotonga
Fletcher Christian called there with Bounty mutineers in 1789. They are credited with its discovery. No other ships called until 1813 or 1814 (D.L. Stoddart 1975).
67 km2 (25.8 sq. mi., 16 602 acres). High volcanic, 643 m (2110'), with at least 7 central summits. Fringing lowland, with inner swampy ring. Cloud forest above 400 m (proposed Te Manga Nature Reserve of 118 ha - 80% of cloud forest). Fringing reef. Main settlement coastal, tropical fruit growing. Administration centre for Cook Islands.
Pig, ?dog, cat, Pacific rat, Norway rat, ship rat, mouse (Robertson et al. 1994). Indian myna (Lever 1987: 499).
All three rats trapped on Rarotonga in 1963 (Alicata and McCarthy 1964).
Williams (1839) writing of Rarotonga in about 1827– 28 states that rats were exceedingly numerous; “we never sat down to a meal without having two or more persons to keep them off the table”. Rats destroyed a pair of bellows and also a pair of shoes belonging to the missionaries. They complained to the authorities, who organised an extermination campaign against the rats: “After school, man, woman, and child armed themselves with suitable weapons, and commenced their direful operations. Baskets were made of coconut leaves, about five or six feet in length, in which to deposit the bodies of the slain, and in about an hour, no less than thirty of these were filled. But notwithstanding this destruction, there did not appear the slightest diminution…” (Williams 1839).
Cats were introduced by early missionaries. They were useful in keeping down the abundant native rat. When the rats became scarce, the cats took to the birds and exterminated several species (Gill 1885: 127).
Williams (1839) brought both pigs and cats to the island (in 1827–28) and considered that the pigs were more effective than the cats in destroying the rats.
Northern Cook Islands
Manihiki
Discovered by Patrickson in 1822. Early 19th C whaling port of call (Douglas 1969).

5 km2 (2.0 sq. mi., 1344 acres). Atoll with lagoon islets. Pearl shell and copra. ?Cat, Pacific rat, Norway rat.

“Comments by Ward (1967) and Lamont (1867) suggest that the pigs may have been introduced to Tongareva in 1835 from the ship-wrecked vessel Chatham” (Clapp 1977: 2).
Rats a problem to copra crop (Daniel 1978).
Pukapuka Discovered by the Spanish explorer Mendana during or after 1595 (Beaglehole and Beaglehole 1938). 5 km2 (2.0 sq. mi., 1250 acres). Atoll with 3 groups of islets. Main islet inhabited, others used for plantations. Copra, banana growing. Pig, Pacific rat (Beaglehole and Beaglehole 1938).

Significant invasive land vertebrates No information found.
Opportunities for island restoration Unknown.
Fiji (c. 190 islands in group)
The Fiji Islands were first sighted by Tasman in 1643, but nothing more was seen or heard of them until the 1775– 1800 period. A sandalwood trade existed between 1801 and 1810, by which time the sandalwood thickets had all been cut. A United States Exploring Expedition surveyed practically all the coasts of the principal islands in 1840. Port facilities became available at Suva c. 1880. Prior to that the main port was Levuka on Ovalau. Levuka was the earliest European settlement on Fiji and at one time the capital (Derrick 1951). Total land area: 18 272 km2 (7055 sq. mi.), mostly in two major islands (Viti Levu, Vanua Levu). The group is a mixture of high volcanic and smaller limestone islands. High mountains of main islands (1200+ m) create a rainshadow to the west (Pernetta and Watling 1978).
Significant invasive land vertebrates Cattle, goat, pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, ship rat, Norway rat, mouse, mongoose, cane toad, Indian myna, jungle myna, red-vented bulbul.
Also: Fallow deer, horse, red deer, sheep, chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys (Pernetta and Watling 1978)
For extensive, detailed information on species introduced to Fiji, their distribution within Fiji, their

impact on native flora and fauna, and some information on extinctions, see Pernetta and Watling (1978).
Rats It appears that R. rattus had not reached Fiji by 1840, but mice were present (Cassin 1858).
Williams (1974) states that R. exulans is clearly the most widespread species of rat in Fiji. R. rattus is fairly widespread on the main islands. R. norvegicus appears to be a relatively unimportant rat in Fiji’s rural environment.
Following Pernetta and Watling (1978):
R. exulans, aboriginal, all islands, abundant, all habitats R. norvegicus, 19th century, main islands, common, agric., ur-
ban, suburban, coastal R. rattus, 19th century, main islands, locally abundant, agric.,
plantation, urban, suburban, coastal M. musculus, 19th century, Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, locally abun-
dant, urban, suburban, agricultural
“The more recently introduced rats and mice have no apparent effect on the distribution of the prehistorically introduced Rattus exulans, as all three species may be found in the same habitats. There is some indication that the Norway rat is more abundant in suburban situations than the other two species... that the black rat may preferentially inhabit plantations and coconut palm crowns ... and that these species are restricted in their distribution to a close association with humans ...” (Pernetta and Watling 1978: 233).
In the Lau group, where R. rattus is absent, the “Virtual absence of rat-damaged coconuts on Matuku and Lakeba supported … trapping results as it was established that R. rattus was responsible for most of the damage in mature coconut groves” (Williams 1974).
In 1933, in a detailed study of rat damage on copra crops, it was commented: “The extent of the damage done by rats varies considerably in different localities” (Paine 1934: 26). “Rat damage to coconuts in Fiji has, in the past been greatly underestimated, or else it has become very much more severe than it was five or more years ago” …. “on Taveuni, it appears likely that at present rats are destroying something like one-third of the total potential copra crop at various stages in its preparation” (Paine 1934: 33)
Other domestic animals “Domestic animals such as horses and cattle are also widespread throughout the islands and may roam in a relatively unrestricted manner over the unfenced grasslands of the dry and intermediate zones. In a number of localities in the intermediate zone of Viti Levu and Kadavu, feral goats are found in small numbers. These animals are also found on various islands,

38

Atkinson and Atkinson: Land vertebrates as invasive species

such as Goat Island in the Yasawas, and Namara Island in the Kadavu group. Although European introductions of dogs and cats have resulted in their widespread distribution throughout the islands, no feral populations of these animals are known at present. European breeds of domestic pigs and sheep are maintained under agricultural conditions, as are large numbers of fowl, ducks, geese, and turkeys” (Pernetta and Watling 1978: 229).
Mongooses Mongooses were introduced in 1883 to control rats in sugar cane (Gorman 1975a, in Pernetta and Watling 1978: 229). Mongooses are present only on Viti Levu and Vanua Levu (Pernetta and Watling 1978: 228). “… it is possible to state conclusively that the banded rail, Rallus phillopensis, sooty rail, Porzana tabuensis, white-browed rail, Poliolimnas cinereus, and purple swamphen, Porphyrio porphyrio, were all common on Viti Levu in the last century. These now survive in any numbers only on islands that are free of the mongoose” (Pernetta and Watling 1978: 229–230).
Introduced birds (greater detail in Pernetta and Watling 1978)
Indian myna (Acridotheres tristis) - introduced c. 1890, present and common on the main islands.
Jungle myna (Acridotheres fuscus) - introduced c. 1890, present and common on the main islands, except Taveuni.
Red-vented bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer) - introduced c. 1900, common on Viti Levu, Ovalau, Wakaya, present but rare on Beqa and Taveuni.
Extinct fauna Recent archaeological work on Viti Levu (Worthy et al. 1999) reveals many extinct species of bird and reptile. They describe an unexpectedly rich pitfall fauna from Viti Levu that includes a crocodilian, a tortoise, a giant frog, a giant iguana like that of the Galapagos Islands, a giant flightless megapode, and a giant flightless pigeon.
Beqa
Just south of Viti Levu.
Pacific rat. Williams (1974) caught R. exulans only. Red-vented bulbul (rare) (Pernetta and Watling 1978).
Kadavu
A large island south of Viti Levu. Used for some years (c. 1870-80) “for the trans-shipment of passengers, mails, and cargo for New Zealand and the islands” (Derrick 1951:4).
Goat, pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, ship rat.

Thomson (1889) explored the island during 1884: “Of domestic animals, there is the pig, the goat, the dog, and the cat...”
Williams (1974) trapped both R. exulans and R. rattus.
Lakeba (Lau group) South-east of Vanua Levu. Pacific rat. Norway rat (introduced 1875-1900?)
Williams (1974) trapped R. exulans.
Norway rat trapped on Lakeba – the only one of the Lau group where this species was found. “ …Village elders thought that it migrated from ships that were wrecked late in the 19th century” (Williams 1974).
Laucala Laucala is immediately east of Taveuni. Pacific rat, ship rat. Williams (1974) trapped R. exulans and R. rattus.

Moala Moala is east of the Kadavu group. Volcanic, 8 peaks over 1000', rugged. Forest. Fringing reef. Copra and banana cultivation. Pacific rat, ship rat.
Williams (1974) trapped R. exulans and R. rattus.
Ovalau Ovalau is off the north-east coast of Viti Levu. Levuka on Ovalau was the earliest European settlement on Fiji and at one time the capital (c. 1840) (Derrick 1951: 7). In 1835 “missionaries and their wives and families arrived by way of Tonga” (Derrick 1951). Volcanic, rugged, fertile, forest. Pineapple, copra, coconut, sugar cultivation. Much timber felled. Norway rat (introduced pre-1876), ship rat (introduced pre-1876). Red-vented bulbul (common) (Pernetta and Watling 1978).
Moseley (1944 (1879): 266) observed that “the black rat and the Norway rat are abundant here.”
Taveuni Volcanic, 914 m (3000'), steep slopes, crater lake, forest and a rich bird fauna. Cultivation of cotton, coffee, lifestock. Ravilevu National Park, mountain area with mixed forest. ?Pig, ?dog, ?cat, Pacific rat, Norway rat, ship rat, mouse (Williams 1974). Indian myna (common), redvented bulbul (rare) (Pernetta and Watling 1978).
39

Invasive species in the Pacific

Mongooses absent, more R. norvegicus present than on Viti Levu or Vanua Levu (J. M. Williams, pers. comm.).
Greatest concentration of R. norvegicus was in a “plantation habitat … on Waitavala Estate, Taveuni … R. exulans, R. rattus and Mus musculus were also trapped in the same area indicating that the relatively simple habitat of a well maintained mature coconut plantation is capable of supporting four rodent species” (Williams 1974).
Vanua Balavu Vanua Balavu is east of Taveuni. Pacific rat, ship rat.
Williams (1974) trapped R. exulans and R. rattus.
Vanua Levu American whaler, the Faun, wrecked in August 1830. Volcanic, amalgamation of several islands, up to 835 m (2740'), wet forest, arid plains. Coconut plantations. Cattle, pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, Norway rat, ship rat, mouse, mongoose, cane toad, Indian myna, jungle myna (both common) (Pernetta and Watling 1978).
Pernetta and Watling (1978) record norvegicus as “common”, rattus as “locally abundant”, exulans as “abundant” and M. musculus as “locally abundant”.
Vatulele Vatulele is immediately south of Viti Levu. Limestone, wedge of honeycombed land, vertical cliffs, reef. Pacific rat.
Williams (1974) trapped R. exulans only.
Viti Levu Age (via C14) of the oldest known Lapita pottery site on Viti Levu is 1590 BC (± 100) (Green 1979). Port facilities opened at Suva in about 1880–81 (Derrick 1951). Volcanic, 1323 m (4341'), Mountain backbone causing rainforests and rainshadow. Savannas. Cattle, goat, pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, Norway rat (pre-1876), ship rat (pre-1876), mouse, mongoose, cane toad, Indian myna, jungle myna (both common) (Pernetta and Watling 1978). Red-vented bulbul (common) (Pernetta and Watling 1978).
The journal of Henry Thurston (1924: 396) describing a journey through the interior of Viti Levu in 1865, mentions natives killing a “wild cat”. Also mentioned are wandering pigs and a domesticated dog.
Moseley (1944 (1879): 280) recorded that “Black rat and Norway rat are abundant at Viti, Fiji...”
Pernetta and Watling (1978) record R. exulans as “abundant”, R. norvegicus as “common”, R. rattus
40

as “locally abundant”, M. musculus as “locally abundant”.
Gorman (1975b) provides data on the habitat distribution of introduced birds on Viti Levu.
The Viti Levu rail (Nesoclopeus poecilopterus) became extinct during the “last 100 years” – 1845–1945 (Mayr 1945a).
Yacata (Lau Group) Yacata is between Taveuni and Vanua Balavu. Pacific rat.
Williams (1974) trapped R. exulans only.
Yasawa Group – Nauya Lailai, Naukacuvu, Yasawa Nauya Lailai – site of shipwreck in 19th century. Following Williams (1974):
Nauya Lailai R. exulans, R. rattus, R. norvegicus Naukacuvu R. exulans only Yasawa R. exulans only
Other islands in the group were not trapped.
Opportunities for island restoration Williams (letter, 1982): “Within Fiji I do not know of any islands which are altogether rat free. However, there are 320 in the group, counting all the tiny dots along the reefs, so clearly some of the very small ones will not have rats – but they support very little else either. I visited and trapped 17 of the inhabited islands and found at least R. exulans on them all …. I trapped R. rattus on eight of the smaller islands – and R. norvegicus on only three.”
Lakeba may be the only island in the Lau Group which has R. norvegicus (Williams 1973).
Paine (1934), writing of Kanacea (in the northern Lau group), stated: “It is interesting to record here, in comparison with Nabavatu, that on Kanacea, an island only twelve miles distant, there are no rats. The present manager of this estate has energetically guarded against the landing of rats from ships calling at Kanacea, and on at least one occasion, succeeded in intercepting would-be colonies brought ashore inside packing cases”.
Gambier (Mangareva) Islands (French Polynesia) (11 islands in group)
Seven volcanic islands, and three low coral atolls. Significant invasive land vertebrates:
?Dog and cat (“probably”, C. Blanvillain, pers. comm. 1999). Pacific rat, rabbit.

Atkinson and Atkinson: Land vertebrates as invasive species

Rabbits have been introduced to Manui I. – a volcanic island which is visited for bird hunting (Douglas 1969, J.E.C. Flux pers. comm.).
Mangareva Mangareva was inhabited before the 16th century (Douglas 1969).
13 km2 (5 sq. mi.). The largest island of the group. High volcanic, 441 m (1447'). Cultivation of coffee, bananas and vegetables. Pacific rat.
Buck (1938) stated that rats were present in such large numbers that methods were adopted to protect food from them.
Mangareva kingfisher, extinct 1841 (King 1981).
Opportunities for island restoration Consider rabbit eradication from the presumably uninhabited Manui I.

Gilbert Islands (Kiribati)
(16 islands in group)
Nukunau discovered by Admiral Byron in 1765. Visited next by Europeans in 1788. About 1827 the neighbourhood of the Gilbert group became a favourite fishingground for ships engaged in sperm-whale fishing. Wilkes expedition surveyed the islands in 1841. Now part of Kiribati, with Line and Phoenix Islands.
Total area: 295 km2 (114 sq. mi.). All atolls, all inhabited, coconut plantations over most of the islands. Droughts common.
Significant invasive land vertebrates
?Pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat (Woodford 1895), ship rat (J.M. Williams, letter 1982).
“On some islands [in the Marshall and Gilbert groups] feral dogs and cats exist” Amerson (1969).
In 1841, Peale (in Poesch 1961) described Pitt Island (now Makin I.) with the words “Rats were running in all directions.”
“The arrival of R. rattus in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands … mostly occurred during the 1940s. …. At present ship rats occupy only three islands in Kiribati – Tarawa, Butaritari, Abaiang – but all the 16 inhabited islands are occupied by R. exulans” (Williams, letter 1982). Smith (1968) states that ship rats have reached four islands in the group, but does not state which.
Islands have always had “a poorer avifauna than some of their dependencies such as Christmas Island” but “seabirds in particular have been further reduced in recent years by rats and other introduced predators

and an expanding human population” (Bourne in Morris 1964).
Tarawa atoll: “In common with other Pacific territories, increasing rat damage in recent years is a matter of considerable concern.” But “… damage to the coconut crop appears to be of little economic importance on islands where only the Polynesian rat is known to be present.” “…evidence to date suggests that the establishment of [the ship rat] occurred during World War II” (Smith 1968).
Williams (letter 1982): “Norvegicus has not been trapped in the Gilbert Islands – even at the main port of Betio in Tarawa.”
Opportunities for island restoration
Possibly eradicate ship rats from some of the 3 (following Williams, letter 1982) or 4 (following Smith 1968) islands in the group on which they are present.
Guam (USA)
Discovered by Magellan in 1521 (he called it Ladrones). Spain took possession in 1565. Became a provisioning port for the next century for Spanish galleons. First Spanish missions in 1668, a Spanish colonial outpost for the next 200 years. Ceded to USA in 1898 after the Spanish– American war. May have been inhabited by a longforgotten people as long as 5000 years ago. 541 km2 (209 sq. mi.). Raised limestone, weathered volcanics, 393 m (1290'). Forest. Savanna. US Naval Base.
Significant invasive land vertebrates
Pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, Norway rat, ship rat, mouse, musk shrew, cane toad (Jackson 1962), brown tree snake.

Invasive species in the Pacific

Also: Micronesian deer (Rusa mariana) [?same as rusa deer Cervus timorensis (G. Nugent, pers. comm. 2000)] (Johnson 1962: 37, Flannery 1995), Rattus tanezumi (Flannery 1995), monitor lizards (Savidge 1987: 664).
Guam has become a major shipping and air travel hub for the western Pacific. Its vulnerability to increasing introductions of alien species is shown by records of 17 species of introduced amphibians and reptiles, 15 of which have been recorded since World War II. Nine species of introduced amphibian and reptile are now established on Guam, including the brown tree snake (McCoid 1993).
Baker (1946) describes in detail the impact of war on Guam, including the probable extinction of the Marianas mallard (Anas oustaleti).
Brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis) Greenway writing before the impact of the brown tree snake (1967: 79) noted: “The remarkable fact is that no species or subspecies is known to have been totally extirpated in spite of permanent habitations by Europeans for almost 300 years”. More recently, Case (1996: 71) commented: “7 bird species introduced, at least 7 native bird species extinct”.
The brown tree snake was “…probably transported to Guam as a passive stowaway in military cargo in the late 1940s or early 1950s” (Savidge 1987: 662). By 1982 had colonised whole island (Savidge 1987: 663). Its habitat is forest and small fields, but it is uncommon in savanna (Savidge 1987: 665).
Seven bird species have become extinct since brown tree snakes were introduced. (One wetland species last seen in 1970, six forest species last seen in early to mid-1980s.) “The remaining forest avifauna is extremely rare” (Savidge 1987: 661). The brown tree snake preys on eggs, nestlings, and adult birds (Savidge 1987: 662), and also reptiles and invertebrates. The snake has “few competitors and no significant predators” on Guam (Savidge 1987: 666). McCoid (1991) discusses possible secondary (or “flow-on”) effects of its introduction on Guam.
Natural areas at risk – The surrounding small islands in the Mariana group, and probably all other tropical Pacific islands (excepting those of Australia, Indonesia, New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, where the brown tree snake is native). The risk is greatest on islands with direct air or sea links to Guam.
Cocos Island (2.5 km south of Guam) is a “natural exclusion experiment” … rats present, monitors and snakes absent (Savidge 1987: 660, 664).
Pacific rat Irregularly distributed all over the island, but more numerous in cultivated or formerly cultivated land.
42

Always was less numerous than R. rattus and never found in isolated populations (Crabb and Emik 1946).
Ship rat Common all over Guam (Crabb and Emik 1946). Several observations of “swarms on coast” (e.g. de Freycinet 1824).
Norway rat Introduced by late 50s (Barbehenn 1974).
It is noteworthy that Baker (1946) commented: “On Guam, where this animal [R. norvegicus] does not occur, there was less commerce before the war and ships usually anchored offshore. Now that docks are present on Guam and shipping has increased, there is greater chance for this pest to be introduced”.
Musk shrew (Suncus murinus) Barbehenn (1974) provides an excellent discussion of the invasion of Guam by the musk shrew. It was first “discovered on Guam in May 1953 … spread was facilitated by the transportation of goods. Colonization of the island was essentially complete by 1958 … with every conceivable habitat being occupied.… the major food of the shrew on Guam consists of invertebrates but it is capable of feeding on any small vertebrate. Ground-dwelling skinks are a likely target … At 6.2/acre, Suncus was the most abundant species.” Mice may have declined in number since the establishment of the musk shrew.
Barbehenn (1974: 48–59) comments that the musk shrew, commonly regarded “as a commensal (‘domestic’) species”, has had an unpredictable effect in Micronesia, becoming an “instant success” across all terrestrial habitats.
Micronesian megapode extinct or nearly so (Douglas 1969).
Opportunities for island restoration The vegetation of Guam is so altered that only a skilled botanist can tell which plants are indigenous and which are introduced.
Hawaiian Islands (USA)
(21 islands in group)
Total area: c. 13 558 km2 (5235 sq. mi.) (Case 1996: 71).
Significant invasive land vertebrates
Cattle, goat, pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, Norway rat (introduced 1825–35), ship rat (introduced c. 1870– 80, possibly as early as 1840) (Atkinson 1977), mouse, rabbit, mongoose.
Indian myna, red-vented bulbul (Lever 1987).

Also: Horse, sheep, mouflon, axis deer, mule deer, donkey, pronghorn, rock wallaby (Petrogale pencillata), Indian buffalo (Bubalus bubalis).
Palaeontological work by Olson and James suggests that: “Some 50 per cent of the original bird species were lost in prehistoric times, while the much publicized extinctions in historic times involved only some 15 per cent of the original species”. Reasons for prehistoric extinctions will include habitat destruction, introduction of predators, and hunting for food and plumage (Boag 1983).
Cassin (1858 – US Exploring Expedition) recorded mice as present.
Hawaiian brown rail, extinct 1864, Hawaiian spotted rail, extinct 1893 (King 1981).
See Tomich (1986) for distribution (historic and present) of introduced animals, and detailed case studies of impacts and control methods of each (summarised in Table 3).
Northwestern Hawaiian Chain (from west to east)
Kure Atoll 0.85 km2 (0.33 sq. mi.). Wildlife sanctuary.
“Dogs have been kept as pets intermittently, and a pig, scheduled as the prime attraction at a feast, also became a pet, but these have not caused undue dam-

age” (King 1973:74). “The Polynesian rat … population on Kure fluctuates widely from season to season (20–77 rats per acre). Kepler (1967) reports this rat preys on [several seabirds]”.
Midway Islands
8 km2 (3.1 sq. mi.). 2 main islands (Sand and Eastern), 21 islets. US Naval Station since 1903. Has had “continuous human occupancy since 1903 and is the most altered of the Northwestern Hawaiian Chain” (King 1973: 92–93).
?Dog, Pacific rat, ship rat (Sand I. and Eastern I.), mouse (Sand I. and Eastern I.) (Tomich 1986). Indian myna (Lever 1987).
Also: (Formerly donkey on Eastern I.) (Tomich 1986).
No native mammals. According to Johnson (1945) the earliest introduction was mice. Ship rats were first reported in March 1943. “In August 1943, even though rats were not common, it was noted that there was a reduction in numbers of the small flightless Laysan rail... As rats have increased in numbers they have entirely destroyed the Laysan rail and the Laysan finch. They have nearly exterminated canaries and doubtless affected other bird species on the islands” (Johnson 1945). The last Laysan rail was last seen in November 1943 (Munro 1945).
“The Laysan finch was considerably more abundant than the rail. Its disappearance followed that of the

rail, and was likewise abrupt.... The canary population in 1943 was about 500” ... but by October 1944, only 2 canaries appeared to be left. “There are no records or reports of signs of disease among these birds, in connection with their decrease and disappearance” (Munro 1945).
Rats are said to have come ashore with practically every cargo of food or soap (Johnson 1945). Ship rats known to prey on Bonin petrel eggs (Grant et al. 1981).
“Cats are forbidden on Midway” (King 1973: 93). Dogs brought from Sand islet to Eastern islet: “for the purpose of running them through the incubating albatrosses” (King 1973: 93).
Indian myna “first recorded on Kure and Midway Atolls in 1974; on the latter, they had increased to several hundred by mid-1980” (Lever 1987: 498).
Pearl and Hermes Atoll
0.36 km2 (0.14 sq. mi.). Uninhabited.
“No rats occur there in spite of military activity” … “Rabbits were introduced in the early 1920s but were extirpated within three years” (King 1973: 92). Or as Tomich (1986: 35) states, rabbits were introduced prior to 1916, and exterminated in 1928.
Lisianski
175 hectares (432 acres). Atoll with one island on extensive reef platform.
No introduced predators. (Formerly rabbits.)
Flux and Fullager (1992: 172–173) describe debate about the fate of rabbits on Lisianski: “Domestic rabbits introduced from Laysan after 1903 had destroyed the vegetation by 1913, when only a few living but many dead rabbits were seen. In 1923 only bleached and weathered bones were found, and the vegetation was starting to return (Watson 1961). Tomich (1986) suggests that the population on Lisianski, having had less control than that on Laysan, ate all the vegetation and starved sooner. According to Clapp and Wirtz (1975), Munter removed the last seven rabbits in March 1915 and none have been seen since.”
Laysan
4 km2 (1.56 sq. mi.) (King 1973). Atoll with one island and central saline lagoon.
No introduced predators. (Formerly rabbits, guinea pig, and pig.)
Rabbits introduced by M. Schlemmer, the former manager of the guano company about 1903. Domestic rabbits, Belgian hares, and English hares. The rabbits have crossed and produced many strange-look-

ing animals both in form and colour.… Man-o-war birds catch them, and young found dead on nest of red-footed booby (Dill and Bryan 1912).
Flux and Fullager (1992: 172) quote Watson’s (1961) description of the removal of rabbits: “In 1911 a scientific expedition found Rabbits extremely abundant and recommended their removal before the vegetation was severely damaged. Four men shot 5000 rabbits in 2 months in 1912–13, but could not eliminate them. In 1923 the island was ‘a barren waste of sand with a few stunted trees’, only four of 26 plant species could be found, and three land birds had died out. A few hundred rabbits remained and these were killed. By 1936 the island was re-covered with vegetation.” See also Lamoureux (1963: 22): The “members of the Tanager Expedition … exterminated the rabbits and planted several kinds of seeds and cuttings” in 1923.
Tomich (1986) states that “vegetation of both islands [Laysan and Lisianski] has made a remarkable recovery”, quoting Lamoureux (1963) regarding Laysan: “Not only are many of the original species still present, but the structure of the vegetation appears similar to that described before the island was devastated by rabbits”.
Pigs “allowed to roam over the island” and “were found foraging on an abundant ‘yam' (=Boerhavia)” (Tomich 1986: 121). Guinea pigs, also introduced by M. Schlemmer, [were] rather abundant at one place on the south end of the island (Dill and Bryan 1912).
“Formerly 5 endemic birds incl. rail, honeyeater and warbler: all now extinct…” (Douglas 1969).
French Frigate shoals
0.44 km2 (0.17 sq. mi.).
Tern islet – dogs, (formerly pigs and cats) (King 1973: 91).
Nihoa 0.65 km2 (0.25 sq. mi.).
“No introduced predators” (King 1973: 90).
Kaula Island
0.54 km2 (0.21 sq. mi.). Avifauna typical of northwestern chain.
A “rat of unknown species” (King 1973: 94).
Hawai‘i
10 458 km2 (4038 sq. mi.). High volcanic, to 4214 m (13 825'), with two volcanic cones, one active.
Cattle, goat, pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, Norway rat, ship rat, mouse, mongoose. Indian myna (Lever 1987).
Also: Donkey, sheep, mouflon, (formerly horse).

Atkinson and Atkinson: Land vertebrates as invasive species

Kaua‘i 1432 km2 (533 sq. mi.). High volcanic, 1598 m (5243'). Cattle, goat, pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, Norway rat, ship rat, mouse. Indian myna (Lever 1987). Also: Mule deer, (formerly horse and donkey).
Maui 1888 km2 (729 sq. mi.). High volcanic, to 3055 m (10 023'), with crater-like summit. Goat, pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, Norway rat, ship rat, mouse, mongoose. Indian myna (Lever 1987).
Also: Axis deer (formerly cattle and horse).
Moloka‘i 676 km2 (261 sq. mi.). High volcanic, to 1515 m (4970'). Cattle, goat, pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, Norway rat, ship rat, mouse, mongoose. Indian myna (Lever 1987).
Also: Axis deer (formerly donkey and water buffalo).
O‘ahu 1575 km2 (608 sq. mi.). High volcanic, range rising to over 914 m (3000'). Intensive population/development including Honolulu, the state's capital and tourist centre. Goat, pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, Norway rat, ship rat, mouse, mongoose. Indian myna, red-vented bulbul (Lever 1987).
Also: Wallaby, axis deer (formerly cattle).
Red-vented bulbul - introduced (?deliberately released) in 1965–66. Now widely distributed on Oahu, but may be confined to residential areas (Lever 1987: 316).
Case studies of significant invasives
Cattle (Tomich 1986: 140–150) Feral cattle historically abundant on Kaua‘i, O‘ahu, Moloka‘i, Maui, and Hawai‘i, also ranging freely on Lana‘i. Now present only on Kaua‘i, Moloka‘i, and Hawai‘i, “in generally inaccessible forest or lava regions”.
Cattle first brought to Hawaii in 1793, by Captain George Vancouver, who “was greatly dedicated to Cook’s cause of stocking the islands with various domestic animals”.
Wild-type cattle intentionally re-released into the wild as late as 1969, for the purpose of photography and hunting for “safari type expeditions” on the slopes of Mauna Loa – have “thrived” and are still present in mid-eighties.
“It is most unfortunate that sample areas of native flora could not have been protected by fences, from the earliest times.”

“Few studies have been made on the process of change in flora and lands under the pressure of cattle…”
Goat (Tomich 1986: 150–156) “Goats are now present and at least sparsely distributed on all main islands except Ni‘ihau and Lana‘i. Populations not under satisfactory control exist on limited areas of Kaua‘i, Maui, Hawai‘i, Kaho‘olawe, and perhaps Moloka‘i.”
Goats first reached Hawai‘i in 1778 on Cook’s first voyage, though these were killed in a later dispute. It is thought that further goats were left in Hawai [i on Cook’s second voyage in 1778–79 (when Cook himself was killed), for by 1793 goats were well known in Hawai‘i. By 1850 goats were abundant and widely distributed in the wild.
Goats “were, and are, significant as a factor in forest and range deterioration [and] the extinction of some specialized plant forms” and “may be an important factor in the ecology of the Hawaiian goose …:
Fencing of “manageable units of land” has been a key element in its control, as well as “drives and final clearing of stragglers with the aid of especially schooled dogs”, imported with a trainer from New Zealand. “Radio-collared goats” can be used to join others and reveal their location. In parks where firearms are forbidden, “substantial reductions” in goat numbers have been made “after initiation of bow hunting”.
Pig (Tomich 1986: 120–126) Feral pigs formerly present on probably all eight major islands, and briefly also on Laysan. They are found now only on Ni‘ihau, Kaua‘i, O‘ahu, Moloka‘i, Maui, and Hawai‘i.
Pigs of Asian ancestry were introduced to Hawai‘i by Polynesians. Cook remarked that a small form of pig was in abundance on Kaua‘i in 1778. Cook also brought English pigs to Hawai‘i on his first voyage and this has been followed by many other importations.
“Feral pigs have long been distributed in the upland forests and pastures of the six larger islands … except on Maui” where they were more localised. Hawaii has “the largest, most widely distributed populations”. “The old Polynesian type … has been absorbed or replaced by stocks of European origin”.
Feral pigs continue to provide a “substantial source of food” and are regularly hunted.
“Watersheds, forests, and range are damaged when pigs root excessively ….” On Hawai‘i, with the control of feral goats and the elimination of feral sheep from certain habitats, the feral pig “has emerged as

45

Invasive species in the Pacific

the most prominent agent of ecological perturbation, of wet forests in particular”.
“…research on control and management of pigs is at an exciting level. Programs appear now to be limited only by available funds and manpower”.
Dog (Tomich 1986: 88–93) “Dogs in Hawaii have two histories, the first dealing with stocks that accompanied Polynesian culture to the islands, and the second resulting from introduction of mixed or selected breeds of dogs from over the world.… In Hawaii dogs were kept as pets, for food, as items of barter, and for sacrifice, and were prominent in sorcery and folklore.”
Feral dogs were able to establish following the establishment of feral herds of sheep and other domestic animals. “Feral dogs attack not only sheep and cattle, but also wild pigs, feral goats, the axis deer, and flightless geese.… [The dog is] a negative factor in management of the Hawaiian goose.” Feral dogs are “identified increasingly as predators” of colonial sea birds.
There have been no specific studies of local feral dog populations.
Cat (Tomich 1986: 101–105) “…generally agreed to have been present in Hawaii since the early days of European contact…” There are reports of cats being “common” in Lana‘i and O‘ahu forests in 1892.
“Feral cats are most common at the lower and middle elevations, but also go high into the rugged mountains.”
“Feral cats are notorious for their actual or alleged predation on birds”. The cat has excellently adapted to living in the wild.
“The feral cat remains the same enigma it was 15 years ago. I know of no major publications on its presence in Hawaii. More than ever, this species demands attention if we are to understand its place in local ecosystems. It is increasingly suspect as an important predator of Newell’s shearwater … a threatened bird … and may have destroyed up to 80 percent of one colony nesting there...”
“We are fortunate that researchers have taken the feral cat seriously in several sectors of the world …”
Pacific rat (Tomich 1986: 42–45) “Found on Kaua‘i, O‘ahu, Moloka‘i, Lana‘i, Maui, Kaho‘olawe, and Hawai‘i. May occur on Ni‘ihau, but is not specifically reported from there. Inhabits also Kure Atoll (at the northwestern end of the chain); Popoi‘a and Mokumanu (near O‘ahu), and Kau‘ula (off Ni‘ihau).”

“… is presumed to have come to Hawaii with early [Polynesian] colonizers … the islands have been occupied from possibly as early as the second century”.
“… is characteristically a lowland rodent … becomes most numerous in sugar cane fields and abandoned pineapple fields, but does well in adjacent wooded or grassy gulch and waste areas. It is usually uncommon in native or planted forests, and is often absent from them at elevations above 2,500 feet”.
Pacific rats are known to prey on the Laysan albatross: “the rats literally eat the birds alive as they sit impassively on their nests”. Also described as a “serious predator” on burrow-nesting species of seabird.
“Studies of the Polynesian rat after 1969 have been numerous …”
Ship rat (Tomich 1986: 37–40) “Found on each of the eight main islands, also on Ford, Kaohikaipu, Mokuolo‘e, Mokoli‘i, and Moku‘auia (all near O‘ahu), and Sand and Eastern islands at Midway; may be the rat of Lehua, and possibly occurs on other small islands and islets.”
Probably reached Hawaii in the 1870–1890 period.
“… is adapted especially to wooded gulches, sugar cane fields, and dry, wet, or even extremely wet forests. … is locally common at lower and middle elevations, and is found sparsely distributed at higher altitudes …”
“… has been noted specifically as a predator on native birds” … Is held responsible for the extinction of the Laysan rail, and the extirpation of a population of the Laysan finch. Many reports of bird predation.
Norway rat (Tomich 1986: 40–41) “Recorded from Kaua‘i, O‘ahu, Moloka‘i, Lana‘i, Maui, and Hawai‘i. May occur on the few smaller islands where permanent human settlements are present; known also from Ford Island in Pearl Harbor.”
“… sometimes locally common in and about lowland sugar cane fields… also middle elevation planted forests … Extreme known elevation is 5,800 feet …”
Mouse (Tomich 1986: 45–50) “Found on all major islands, except that specific record is lacking for Ni‘ihau. Known also from Midway islands and Ka‘ula, Mokuolo‘e, Manana, Kekepa, and Kapapa (islets near O‘ahu).”
“The house mouse is now ubiquitous in Hawaii and may occupy in numbers even more ecological niches than does Rattus rattus.… it exists not only as a commensal, but also as a highly adapted wild species. Dense populations occur regularly in sugar cane

46

Atkinson and Atkinson: Land vertebrates as invasive species

and pineapple fields and are found also in lower elevation wet forests. Extremely wet forests and upland swamps, however, may be shunned entirely.” Has been seen live at up to 12 400 feet.
“Populations of mice reaching plague proportions irrupt sporadically during late summer and fall …”
Rabbit (Tomich 1986: 30–37) There is evidence that rabbits were brought in soon after European settlement. The pattern of early rabbit management in Hawaii, was “to turn the animals out on small islands to fend for themselves”.
Presently surviving only on Manana and Lehua.
“Eradication of feral rabbits … has been advocated by ornithologists and others interested in the welfare of nesting sea birds…”
Mongoose (Tomich 1986: 93–101) “Occurs on O‘ahu, Moloka‘i, Maui, and Hawai‘i; widespread and firmly established throughout these four islands.” Also on Ford Island in Pearl Harbour.
Mongooses live from sea level, to the upper limit of vegetation near 10 000 feet on Hawai‘i.
“Greatest concentrations are in beach and lowland areas…”
“A central question for Hawaii is whether the mongoose is a negative factor in relation to birds, both native and introduced, and whether it is of positive value in rodent control. This animal is thoroughly omnivorous … Specific cases of bird predation are reported …”
“Local control … by poisoning and trapping … is a relatively simple matter … Eradication … would be a formidable task …”
Indian myna (notes from Lever 1987: 497–498) Indian myna “reported to be abundant in Honolulu in 1879 .. was introduced to (or colonized) the other main islands around 1883”. Colonised Kure and Midway Atolls in 1974.
Is “... most common ... in the vicinity of human habitation ... [but occurs] up to at least 8,000 feet (2,400 m)...”
There is debate over whether Indian myna has a significant effect on native birds. May be a significant predator of the eggs of the wedge-tailed shearwater (Byrd 1979), as 23 per cent of eggs were destroyed by mynas in a study area. Has been the cause of rapid spread of introduced Lantana species, by seed, until this has become an agricultural nuisance.
Opportunities for island restoration
Consider rabbit eradication from islands on which rabbits are still present. We believe rabbits may have been recently eliminated from Lehua and Manana

(rabbits were present on these islands according to Tomich 1986). Tomich suggests that removal of rabbits from the larger island, Lehua, may be “advisable” due to remnants of significant native vegetation. However, he comments that this “is likely to be impossible with means that can be reasonably found to do it”.
Consider eradication of feral cattle: “A strong program should be activated for eliminating these animals from public lands, and cattlemen should support any reasonable program proposed for the elimination of their own feral herds” (Tomich 1986: 148–150).
Line/Equatorial Islands (Kiribati and USA)
(c. 11 islands in group)
Kingman Reef, Palmyra, and Jarvis, remain US territories, and are not part of Kiribati. All but one island in group discovered between 1777 and 1825 (Krauss 1970).
Significant invasive land vertebrates
Pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, ship rat, mouse. (Formerly goat.) Indian myna (Lever 1987: 499, following Holyoak and Thibault 1984).
Caroline 3.8 km2 (1.45 sq. mi.). Atoll with 24 reef islets. Once inhabited by Polynesians – small settlement in 19th century. Phosphate workings in 1872–95. Coconut plantations – abandoned in 1943, after prolonged drought (King 1973: 96). Pacific rat. King (1973: 96) suggests that “Polynesian rats are uncommon and may be restricted to one islet in the atoll”.
Christmas Discovered by Cook on 24 December 1777. WWII garrison from NZ and USA. Nuclear weapons tests by British and Americans 1956–62. Garrison departed in 1967. Gilbertese population. No indigenous population. 321.37 km2 (124.08 sq. mi.). Atoll with large flat island and almost landlocked lagoon. Fringing reef. Semi-arid. Coconut plantations. ?Pig, ?dog, cat, Pacific rat, mouse.
“Large numbers of feral cats” (King 1973: 95). “The Lesser Frigatebird (Fregata ariel) population on Christmas has declined as a direct result of cat predation, and may be eliminated entirely in the next few years” (King 1973: 96).
Only R. exulans present (J. Clark, pers. comm. c. 1988). It would appear that King (1973) and Nelson 1922: 239) were mistaken in suggesting that ship rats were present on Christmas island.
47

Invasive species in the Pacific

Rougier (1925: 869) mentions tame birds. It is not clear whether he refers to boobies or birds in general: “You can touch with your own hands any bird on Christmas Island.” Also comments that: “Eggs are spread all over the ground, as these birds [Sterna pulginosa] do not make nests.” He states that as a visitor “You have not seen … rats … although you have seen legions of mice” (Rougier 1925: 870).
Two land birds now extinct? (Nelson 1922: 237).
Fanning
Polynesian remains (Emory 1934). Discovered by Captain Fanning of the Betsy (USA) in 1798. 32 km2 (12.4 sq. mi.). Atoll with almost enclosed lagoon encircled by almost continuous islands, fringing reef. Gilbertese population (King 1973: 96). Coconut plantations.
Pig, dog, cat, ship rat (introduced pre-1924) (Williams, letter 1982).
“Dogs, cats, and pigs are present under domestication” (King 1973: 95).
Chandler (1931) “In Fanning Island …. [a] great deal of damage is done by rats which seldom or never come to ground and no satisfactory method of dealing with them has yet been found.”
The Christmas Island warbler appears to have been extirpated (King 1973: 95).
Jarvis
No Polynesian remains (Emory 1934). Said to have been discovered by captain of the Eliza Francis in 1821 (Bryan 1942). Guano mined in 19th/early 20th century. 4.5 km2 (1.75 sq. mi.). Atoll with one island, no lagoon, narrow reef. Arid, “desert-like climate” (Rauzon 1985: 3). No trees. Uninhabited (Kirpatrick and Rauzon 1986: 72).
Cat, rats formerly present (species unknown), ?no rats now, mouse (pre-1924) (Bryan 1942).
Cats introduced as early as 1885, but may not have survived. Cats re-introduced c. 1938, with settlers (King 1973, Rauzon 1982). Predation on seabirds reduced avifauna to 4 breeding species. Sooty terns (Sterna fuscata) and boobies have been the major food source (Rauzon 1982) (see Kirkpatrick and Rauzon 1986 for more detail). One bird eaten per cat per day, total of 24 000 birds killed per year (Rauzon 1983). Efforts to eliminate cats in 1982–83 successful (Kirkpatrick and Rauzon 1986).
No rats observed in 1979 by Kirkpatrick and Rauzon (1986: 73). However, house mice present (Kirkpatrick and Rauzon 1986).
Malden
Pre-European Polynesian population. Used for nuclear weapons testing in 1962.

29 km2 (11.25 sq. mi.). Atoll with central enclosed saline lagoon with evaporites, fringing reef. Rainfall very variable. Unused and unoccupied since guano working ceased in 1927.
Feral pigs, cats and goats (Douglas 1969) [goats now gone?]. Pacific rat.
Goats introduced in 1860s (Emory 1934). Cats still present in 1986 (Kirkpatrick and Rauzon 1986).
Rats (presumably R. exulans) “more than sufficiently numerous” in 1866–69 (Dixon 1878). Reports that cats have exterminated R. exulans (Emory 1934, Bryan 1942).
“POBSP killed a herd of five pigs in 1964, and one last pig died in 1967 or 1968. Five cats were seen in 1967, indicative of a very small population. The pigs were evidently responsible for the moderate numbers of most species of seabirds” (King 1973: 96).
Palmyra
No Polynesian remains (Emory 1934).
1.3 km2 (0.5 sq. mi.). Atoll with 50 islets around lagoon complex on platform reef. Plantations. In US airforce use until 1961. “Uninhabited and privately owned” (King 1973: 95).
Ship rat. Indian myna (Lever 1987: 499).
“As of 1966 it had no dogs or cats, but black rats were fairly common”. … “Black rats have been observed in the Sooty Tern colony preying on eggs” (King 1973: 95, 98).
Bryan (1942) visited Palmyra in 1938 and makes no mention of rats, but comments “It is to be hoped that the construction of a naval air base will not destroy the natural beauty and scientific values of this, one of the most interesting atolls under the American flag”.
Starbuck
No Polynesian remains. Frequent shipwrecks due to strong current and inconspicuous nature of island.
21 km2 (8.1 sq. mi.). Atoll with one island, enclosed shallow lagoons, fringing reef. Uninhabited since 1920. Coconuts failed. Guano workings in late 19th century.
Cat, Pacific rat (King 1973, Kirkpatrick and Rauzon 1986).
“Cats … in large numbers … prey heavily on the large Sooty Tern colony (estimated at 2,500,000 birds); about 1,000 adult birds per night were killed by cats during POBSP visits.” In 1968, “scattered wings and bodies, and piles of bodies were frequently noted” around the edges of the sooty tern colony. Petrels were evidently present once but are no longer (King 1973: 96). Cats still present (Kirkpatrick and Rauzon 1986).

Atkinson and Atkinson: Land vertebrates as invasive species

Vostok
Discovered by a Russian expedition in 1820. 0.3 km2 (0.1 sq. mi.). Atoll with one reef islet. Total flora of 3 species, including magnificent forest of Pisonia grandis. Undisturbed since 1943. Worked for guano and copra in late 19th century. Pacific rat – “abundant” King (1973: 97).
Washington
Discovered by Captain Fanning of the Betsy (USA) in 1798. Polynesian remains. Settled by Europeans since 1860–70 (Emory 1934).
7.5 km2 (2.9 sq. mi.). Atoll with one island and central freshwater lake, fringing reef. Wet, with two important bogs. Coconut plantations. Some canals cut through bog areas, though protection of bogs recommended (Douglas 1969). Gilbertese population (King 1973: 95).
Pig, dog, cat, ship rat (introduced pre-1938) (Bryan 1942).

Ouvea
130 km2 (50.2 sq. mi.). Coconut plantations, remnants of native forest (Robinet et al. 1998: 229).
?Pig, ?dog, ?cat, Pacific rat (Alicata (1963) trapped R. exulans), mouse (Robinet et al. 1998: 229).
Pacific rat predation on eggs and nestlings of endangered Ouvea parakeet (Eunymphicus cornutus), “an endemic subspecies already threatened with extinction by habitat loss and capture by local peoples for the pet market” (Robinet et al. 1998: 223).
Opportunities for island restoration
Islands too large to consider eradication of rats as a possibility in the next decade, but “even a low intensity” rat control programme on Ouvea “may markedly assist the parakeets (Robinet et al. 1998: 231). (No parakeets on Lifou.)

“Cats, dogs and pigs are kept by the Gilbertese, and feral cats are abundant” (King 1973: 95).
Opportunities for island restoration “Elimination of the remaining cats would make Jarvis among the most important seabird islands of the Central Pacific” (King 1973: 96, see also Rauzon 1985).
Consider removing R. rattus from Palmyra “one of the most intersting atolls under the American flag” (Bryan 1942), which apparently has never been colonised by R. exulans.
Vostok - “a relatively unaltered, but simple island ecosystem” (King 1973).

(14 islands in group)
High volcanic islands without barrier reefs, three altitudinal vegetation zones, the highest (1500'–2000') ‘moss forest’. These islands “share with Hawaii a dry tradewind landscape of arid lower slopes and moist high interiors…” But the islands are subject to severe droughts – lasting 3-5 years (Decker 1992: 1–2).
Significant invasive land vertebrates Cattle, goat, pig, ?dog, cat, Pacific rat, Norway rat, ship rat. Indian myna (Lever 1987).

Also: Great horned owl (Bubo virginianus) - “fairly abundant” (Lever 1987: 291).
16 Indian mynas were introduced around 1918, and “had increased within 3 years to an estimated 1,000; the species is today very common in coastal regions and occurs in lesser numbers at higher altitudes.” They have not reached Tahuata, only 3 km away (Lever 1987: 499-500).

an intact ecosystem productively functioning in the harsh central Pacific climate…” (Decker 1975).
Eiao – consider removal of sheep and pigs (if still present). Some replenishment of species may be possible from the nearby Hatutaa.
“Scientifically, the Marquesan biota is the most neglected in Polynesia … every biological collecting expedition to this archipelago yields important novelties …” (Decker 1975).
“Mohotani, once cleared of sheep and possibly cats, would be an excellent site for introduction of most Marquesas endemics” (Seitre and Seitre 1992: 221).

Motane/Mohotani 15.5 km2 (6 sq. mi.). High, dry, with an “interesting flora”. Goat, cat, sheep (C. Blanvillain, pers. comm. 1999).

Opportunities for island restoration Consider eradication programmes for islands with large browsing mammals – sheep, pigs, donkeys, etc…
“Three seldom-visited, but extremely interesting, islands in the northwestern Marquesas group … are among several uninhabited French Polynesian islands that were assigned protection status in 1971 … The islands are remarkable for the contrasts between them. Eiao, the largest, is severely damaged by feral livestock and erosion. Ile de Sable is a tiny sand cay upon the only extensive coral-reef formation in the Marquesas. Hatutaa (Hatutu on many charts) is a pristine terrestrial ecosystem – the only sizeable one left undisturbed in the central Pacific dry zone.... Protected from livestock introduction by its lack of perennial water, Hatutaa teems with bird life and is richly vegetated.… The rarity of type and biological significance of Hatutaa cannot be overemphasised. It is

Marshall Islands
(34 islands in group)
Eight islands uninhabited (King 1973: 100). The Marshall Islands are in two chains: the Ralik chain to the west and the Ratak chain to the east. Almost all the uninhabited islands are devoted to coconut culture. Taongi (Pokak) and Bikar are too dry to sustain the harvest of coconuts. Both are important seabird islands (King 1973). Nuclear weapons tests conducted on Eniwetok and Bikini.
Significant invasive land vertebrates
Pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, ship rat, Norway rat (Spenneman 1997), mouse.
Also: Monitor lizards (Varanus indicus) (Spennemann 1997), Brahminy blind snake (Ramhotyphlos brahmina) (Spennemann 1997: 8).
Amerson (1969) states: “On some islands [in the Marshall and Gilbert groups] feral dogs and cats exist.”
See Spennemann (1997: 7) for table of: “The occurrence of Varanus indicus and the distribution of rodent species on the atolls of the Marshall Islands.”
In summary: Rattus exulans is present on the great majority of islands. R. rattus is present on nine islands (Arno, Eneen-Kio, Enewetak, Jaluit, Kwajalein, Majuro, Maloelap, Mili, Wotje). R. norvegicus is present on two islands (Jaluit, Majuro), and mice on three islands (Enewetak, Jaluit, Majuro).
“The data in hand suggest that the pre-World War II rat population of the Marshall Islands comprised neither R. rattus or R. norvegicus, with the possible exception of Jaluit and Majuro Atolls…” (Spennemann 1997: 5).
“In the Marshall Islands rats were eaten mainly by women” (Spennemann 1997: 4).
“The rat problem on some bases reached such proportions that Varanus indicus [monitor lizards] were introduced to prey upon the rats. Instead, according to local Marshallese informants, the reptiles predated

Antore
Pacific rat (R. H. Taylor, letter 1982).
Arno 13 km2 (5 sq. mi.). Atoll with 100 islets, coconut plantations.
Pacific rat, ship rat (introduced 1942–45).
Marshall (1955) found R. rattus only in certain sites, and reported that “Only in these three spots are green coconuts eaten by rats, and the Arnnese stated that large rats and opened coconuts had been found there only since the period of Japanese control of the atoll. …The species was evidently just gaining a foothold on the atoll in 1950.” Discussing R. exulans, he says “Fresh ripe coconut meat from fallen nuts seems to be the favourite food of this rat”. Mice were not present on the island.
Bikar
0.5 km2 (0.2 sq. mi.). Atoll with 3 reef islets, dry, visited for fishing and birds).
Pacific rat (R. H. Taylor, letter 1982).
Bikini
7.3 km2 (2.82 sq. mi.). Now reduced in area by nuclear weapons tests? Atoll with numerous islets. Population moved to Rogerik, then to Kili, atomic testing, radiation damage. ). “Cultural deposits” on Bikini atoll have been radiocarbon dated “to perhaps greater than 3000 years B.P…. “ (Streck 1990).
Pacific rat (R. H. Taylor, letter 1982).
Eniwetok/Enewetak
5.8 km2 (2.25 sq. mi.). Atoll with 30 islets, population moved to Ujelang in 1947, used for nuclear weapons testing.
Cat (King 1973: 101), Pacific rat, ship rat (introduced c. 1951) (Jackson 1969), mouse “reputedly present” (Spenneman 1997: 2).
Also: Monitor lizard (Varanus indicus, introduced to prey on rats, is known to prey on birdlife – Amerson 1969, Spennemann 1997: 9), Brahminy blind snake (Ramhotyphlos brahmina), “secretive, nocturnal and earthburrowing” and said to be “harmless” (Spennemann 1997: 8).
Pacific rats may have been exterminated by the thermonuclear explosions. Extensive trapping on the islet shows that only R. rattus is now present (Jackson 1969).
Jaluit 3.6 km2 (1.4 sq. mi.). Atoll with 80 reef islets, almost continuous land rim.
Pacific rat, Norway rat (Spennemann 1997: 7), ship rat (introduced pre-1932), mouse (introduced pre1932) (Koroia 1934).

Cats released “to act as vermin control” prior to 1830 (Spennemann 1997:5).
Zatobach Pacific rat (R. H. Taylor, letter 1982).
Opportunities for island restoration Marshallese “have traditionally considered Taongi, Bikar, Jemo, and islets of Taka and Jaluit as bird sanctuaries, on which the taking of birds and eggs for food is restricted but not prohibited” (King 1973: 100).
Nauru
22 km2 (8.5 sq. mi.). Raised limestone, 65 m (213'), with narrow coastal terrace and fringing reef. Most of island’s surface mined for phosphate deposits. Much of labour force Gilbertese or Chinese. Military operations 1942–45.
Significant invasive land vertebrates ?Pigs, ?dogs, ?cats, Pacific rat, ship rat (pre-1979), mouse.
Williams (1979) visited the island in 1979: “Two species of rat, the ship or roof rat (Rattus rattus) and the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans) were trapped. A third species (the Norway or common rat) that is also found on some Pacific islands does not appear to be on Nauru, however the house mouse (Mus musculus) was trapped…”
Island was originally vegetated. “Because of the considerable destruction by guano diggers and by mili-
51

tary operations during the years 1942–1945, a reed warbler (Acrocephalus luscinia rehsei) has been thought to be in danger. Much vegetation remains on Nauru, however, and although it is a very small bird population, it has apparently survived” (Greenway 1967).
R. rattus “is the most commmon [rat] on Nauru and causing the most damage” (Williams 1979).
Opportunities for island restoration
This island has been greatly depleted by phosphate mining. We do not know what opportunities remain for restoring island habitats.
A Nauru Rehabilitation Corporation has been set up at Aiwo recently, but it is not yet known what plans it has to restore native vegetation and bird life (G. Gregory, pers. comm. 2000).
New Caledonia (France)
(One main island and c. 26 small islets)
Total area: 16 912 km2 (Case 1996: 71). Two parallel ridges, to 1676 m (5500'), sedimentary, continental rocks, metamorphosed. Barrier reef. “The main island is 400 kilometres long and forty to fifty kilometres wide.... rugged ranges, ... uninhabited except along some river valleys. Most people live on the lowland coastal plain, much of which has been cleared for grazing or altered by plantations” (Stokes 1980: 81).
“New Caledonia may harbour the most neglected island avifauna close to Australia. Its landbirds included eighteen endemic species, of which four are in monotypic genera ... and one is in a monotypic family ...” (Stokes 1980: 86).
Significant invasive land vertebrates
Cattle, goat, pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, ship rat (introduced pre-1913), Norway rat (introduced pre-1944), mouse (pre-1913) (Revilliod 1913, Marshall 1962, Alicata 1963). Indian myna (Lever 1987).
Also: Donkey, house sparrow (Stokes 1980).
Barrau (1981) discusses the role of cattle in the creation of the extensive present-day savanna. He comments: “... since its inception, the cattle industry of New Caledonia had been based on a myth: that of natural pasture. The gardened savanna landscape of the Melanesians gave the settlers the false impression of a lush and nutritious resource ... Very quickly, due to selective grazing by the cattle, the savanna ecosystem became more biotically specialized.”
Of the c. 26 small islets, most have R. exulans, some are rat-free, and one has R. rattus (B. D. Bell, pers. comm. 1999).
No pre-European dogs (Heyerdahl 1952).

Six introduced bird species, and at least 14 extinct bird species (Case 1996: 71). The New Caledonian rail (Tricholimnas silvestris) became extinct during the last 100 years (1845–1945) (Mayr 1945a). A giant megapode (Sylviornis neocaledoniae) extinct for at least 3000 years (may have disappeared shortly after human colonisation) (Green c. 1985).
Predation on native birds
Warner (1948) mentions several introduced species as predators of a native bird called the kagu (Rhynochetos jubatus). “Escaped pigs and the introduced rats are … causing heavy damage to the kagu at the present time. They not only kill the birds but also destroy its food supply of land snails and large earthworms.... I often found snail shells in rat runways and burrow entrances and scattered about in other odd places. Many of these had been gnawed in typical rat fashion.… The pig and rat may also take young birds and eggs … Cats and dogs roam the mountains and undoubtedly take a heavy toll of the adults and young and of the single eggs.… I spoke with some people who had eaten birds [kagu] killed by their dogs on deer and pig hunting trips.…The Sambar deer (introduced) may have an increasingly detrimental effect on the kagu by the destruction of cover, but during 1945 it was not common enough in the mountain forests of southern New Caledonia to be of importance. Cattle grazing has had no appreciable effect to date.”
“Rattus norvegicus was not common in most of the habitat of the kagu but was taken occasionally far from human habitation. Where lumbering and mining camps were in use, it was present, however, often in considerable numbers.… The three subspecies of the black rat, found to be common to abundant around the abandoned camps, along forest streams, steep banks and in rotting logs and hollow trees” (Warner 1948).
“Thus these factors: (1) decimation by man through trapping and hunting (now prohibited); (2) predation by rats, cats, dogs and pigs; and (3) destruction of natural habitat of both the kagu and its food supply by pigs, and by mining, lumbering and burning, are all hastening the extermination of this endemic species” (Warner 1948).
Extinct avifauna includes: New Caledonian lorikeet (extinct 1860), New Caledonian owlet frogmouth (extinct 1880), New Caledonian wood rail (extinct 1904), Isle of Pines solitaire (extinct 1934) (King 1981).
Opportunities for island restoration

Atkinson and Atkinson: Land vertebrates as invasive species

Niue (NZ)
Discovered by Cook in 1774. 259 km2 (100 sq. mi.). 67 m (220') raised coral plateau with terraced margins, deeply weathered. Much wooded with thickets of secondary growth. No surface water. Settlement mainly on coast, interior uninhabited (see Douglas 1969 for details). Banana, copra, etc. cultivated.
Significant invasive land vertebrates
?Pig, ?dog, ?cat, Pacific rat, ship rat (intro. 19001925), Norway rat (R. Hay, pers. comm. 1999).
Mice have reached the island but have not been able to establish (K. A. Wodzicki, pers. comm. 1975).
“The introduction of the roof or ship rat (Rattus rattus) to Niue during the first quarter of the present century and its successful spread to practically all habitats could have had a profound effect, particularly on all tree-nesting birds” (Wodzicki 1971).
“Fourteen species of birds, including an extinct species each of Gallirallus and Nycticorax, and an extirpated megapode (Megapodius pritchardii) were found. This increases the number of taxa known for the Niue fauna to 15 resident species, but faunas from surrounding islands indicate this is almost certainly an underestimate of original diversity (Worthy et al. 1998: 177).
Opportunities for island restoration
Possibility of protection of native vegetation in rougher areas not suitable for cultivation (Douglas 1969).
Northern Mariana Is
(14 islands in group)
The Northern Mariana Islands are a “Commonwealth and Political Union” of the United States. Saipan is the administrative centre.
Significant invasive land vertebrates
Cattle, goat, pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, Norway rat, ship rat, mouse, musk shrew, brown tree snake (probably present on Saipan), cane toad.
Also: sambar deer, Micronesian deer (Rusa mariana) [?same as rusa deer Cervus timorensis (G. Nugent, pers. comm. 2000)] (Johnson 1962: 37, Flannery 1995), Rattus tanezumi (Flannery 1995).
“When the Japanese took over the islands, a period of extreme exploitation began. On Saipan and Tinian, for example, most of the indigenous forest was cut down to make place for sugar plantations and with it went the native bird life.… the Marianas cardinal honeyeaters had already been badly decimated when William Coultas visited the islands in 1931. Most of

the larger pigeons of the Marianas and of the Palau Islands were on the verge of extinction at that time, as were the Micronesian incubator bird, the Marianas nightingale reed warbler, the Marianas mallard and the Palau gray duck” (Mayr 1945a).
Baker (1946) describes in detail the impact of war on the Mariana Is.
Aguijan 7.3 km2 (2.8 sq. mi.). Steep cliffs to north.
Goat, pig (both feral) (Douglas 1969). Uninhabited, but supports c. 1500 feral goats, and is occasionally visited by goat hunters, and pig hunters. Australian pine introduced as windbreaks and massive pineapple and sugarcane plantations – by Japanese. Goats exterminated much of the original vegetation in early 1940s (DiSalvatore 1981).
Anatahan 32.4 km2 (12.5 sq. mi.). Extinct dissected cone, 788 m (2585'). Has had military use.
Goat. The number of goats on this uninhabited island is “staggering” (Sablan 1976).
Pagan 48 km2 (18.7 sq. mi.). Cluster of active volcanoes, 570 m (1869'), linked by lava and ash. Some coconut plantations.
?Cat, ship rat, Norway rat (Corwin et al. 1957).
“The two varieties of rat are especially abundant in the vicinity of farms and settlements” (Corwin et al. 1957: 109).
Rota 85 km2 (33 sq. mi.). Raised limestone terraces on extinct volcano, 1612'. Some market gardening.
?Pig, ?cat, Pacific rat, ship rat (introduced pre-1932) (Marshall 1962). Musk shrew (established by 1966) (Barbehenn 1974). Cane toad (Steadman 1992).
Also: Rattus tanezumi (Flannery 1995).
Saipan 121 km2 (47 sq. mi.). High volcanic, 474 m (1554'), with raised limestone terraces. Some coconuts. ?Pig, ?dog, ?cat, Pacific rat, Norway rat (has occurred on Saipan since the late 1800s, Kuroda 1938 in Wiles et al. 1990: 174), ship rat (introduced pre-1931), mouse (introduced pre-1931) (all recorded by Marshall 1962). Musk shrew (discovered on Saipan in 1962, probably introduced mid-1960 ) (Barbehenn 1974). Cane toad (McCoid 1993). Brown tree snake? McCoid (1993) considered that Saipan had an “incipient population” of brown tree snakes.
Also: Rattus tanezumi (Flannery 1995).
Baker (1946: 210) suggests the “large amount of Japanese shipping in the prewar days” is probably the
53

Invasive species in the Pacific

reason for the presence of the Norway rat on Saipan.
Enders (1949 in Wiles et al. 1990: 173) found the Pacific rat to be the least common of the three rat species.
Sariguan
4.9 km2 (1.9 sq. mi.). Extinct volcanic cone, 549 m (1800'). Lower slopes cultivated, and coconuts planted.
Goat, rat (species unknown).
Large populations of rats and wild goats – described as a poor candidate for preservation status, because many native species and habitats have been disturbed or destroyed (Anon. 1985).
Tinian
102 km2 (39.25 sq. mi.). Raised limestone, 170 m (557'), small central lake. Disused and overgrown plantations of sugarcane, vegetables and pineapples. Some market gardening, and farming of beef cattle.
Cattle, goat, pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, ship rat (introduced pre-1932), mouse (Marshall 1962). Musk shrew (probably arrived on Tinian in mid-1960s, not reported until 1974) (Wiles et al. 1990: 170). Cane toad (McCoid 1993).
Also: Horse (Wiles et al. 1990: 175), Rattus tanezumi (Flannery 1995). (Formerly Philippine deer, Cervus marianus) (Wiles et al. 1990: 175).
See Wiles et al. (1990) for a comprehensive account of the history and present status (including distribution and habitat) of mammals on Tinian:
Tinian has experienced “…extensive grazing by introduced ungulates during the last 300–400 years…” (Wiles et al. 1990: 167).
Cattle “were introduced to Tinian early in the period of Spanish colonial rule, and were left to roam the island freely in a feral state. [Anson, in 1742, estimated that] several thousand to at least 10,000 animals were present…” By the early 20th century numbers had declined to between several hundred and several thousand, and in 1952 the last feral cow on Tinian was killed. However, Wiles et al. (1990: 176) report that domestic cattle are “common throughout Tinian and probably number about 4,000– 5,000 animals … [These are] routinely pastured in a variety of habitats … particularly open fields, tangantangan forest, and secondary vegetation. They also fed and rested in native forest and strand vegetation…”
“Heavy grazing, browsing, and trampling by cattle have probably eliminated or lowered the abundance of some species of indigenous plants, reduced understory vegetation, lowered plant diversity in native forests, and increased soil erosion and compaction.… Cattle have probably also enhanced
54

the spread of certain introduced plants around the island … habitat degradation has probably resulted in population declines of fruit bats and frugivorous birds, such as Mariana fruit doves (Ptilinopus roseicapilla), and white-throated ground-doves (Gallicolumba xanthonura). The reproductive success of Micronesian megapodes (Megapodius laperouse) may have declined in areas where nesting sites were trampled and soils were compacted by cattle …(Wiles et al. 1990: 177).
“Feral goats inhabited the slopes and cliffs along the southeastern coast of Tinian in the early 1900s, with the population estimated at a few hundred to 500 animals … a feral herd of unknown size still occurs in the extensive tract of coastal forest at Kastiyu” (Wiles et al. 1990: 177).
“Tinian held a large population of feral pigs between the 1700s and early 1900s … During the early 1900s … an estimated population of several thousand animals. The approximate date that feral pigs were extirpated from the island is unknown”. Wiles et al. (1990: 175) found “no indications of feral pigs”.
The “presence of feral and domestic dogs on Tinian was noted by many authors between the mid-1700s and early 1900s…” Domestic dogs common, freeranging dogs present (Wiles et al. 1990: 174).
Cats were first mentioned on Tinian in the mid-1800s. “Small numbers of domestic and free-ranging cats occurred on the island in 1900…” Present sightings indicate “that a feral population still occurs on the island” (Wiles et al. 1990: 174).
The Pacific rat was “presumably … introduced to the Mariana Islands by the Chamorros, who have inhabited the archipelago for at least 3,500 years…” Trapped in the past by Marshall in 1945, no Pacific rats were found by Wiles et al. (1990: 172).
Ship rats “likely reached Tinian aboard European shipping traffic sometime between the 1600s and 1800s. [They] appear to be distributed throughout the island … in all types of habitats except native forest…” (Wiles et al. 1990: 173).
The Norway rat was “not captured” by Wiles et al. (1990: 174). It may not be present.
House mice “seem to be uncommon on Tinian …” Only one was trapped by Wiles et al. (1990: 173).
Musk shrews were “observed islandwide … common in most habitats” (Wiles et al. 1990: 170).
Opportunities for island restoration
Consider removal of goats (if still present) from Aguijan and Anatahan.
The vegetation of some islands (e.g. Guam and Saipan) is so altered that only a skilled botanist can

Atkinson and Atkinson: Land vertebrates as invasive species

tell which plants are indigenous and which are introduced. Anon. (1985) states that in November 1985, four uninhabited islands in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (Uracas (Farallon de Pajaros), Asuncion, Guguan, Maug) were set aside for purposes of conservation and preservation.
Ocean/Banaba Island (Kiribati)
Discovered by an American, Captain Jered Gardner, in 1801. 6.5 km2 (2.5 sq. mi.). Raised limestone, 81 m (265'), with fringing reef. Most of island mined for phosphate.
Significant invasive land vertebrates Ship rat (introduced pre-1970).
“La présence du rat noir se confirme également sur L’île Ocean, ou se trouvent les mines de phosphate…” (Smith 1970).
Rats “appeared at dusk in swarms, so that by morning the sand was laced with their tracks” (Wetmore 1925).
Opportunities for island restoration This island has been extensively modified by phosphate mining. We do not know what opportunities remain for restoring island habitats.
Palau (Belau) Islands (11 islands in group)
Discovered by Spanish about 1543. 440 km2 (170 sq. mi.) (Case 1996: 71). Large group of many close islands, volcanic and limestone. Much disturbed. Largest island Babelthuap.
Significant invasive land vertebrates Goat, pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, Norway rat, ship rat, mouse, musk shrew (Wiles and Conry 1990). Cane toad (McCoid 1993). Also: R. nitidis (Barbehenn 1974), long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis). One observation of a musk shrew on Koror in 1963, but “no subsequent observations …this may have been a sterile introduction” (Barbehenn 1974). Wiles and Conry (1990: 62) commented: “… rats were so numerous on Ulong and Euidelchol, two … limestone islands in southern Palau, that observers could see several animals within minutes of going ashore on each island”. “Pigs and goats, introduced by H.M. ships many years ago, are plentiful in most parts of the group…. Dogs

and cats are found, but as the native names for them are corrupted Spanish words, they were most probably introduced by vessels from Manila which came to trade here formerly” (Robertson 1877, visited Palau islands in 1875).
Four introduced bird species, no known extinct bird species (Case 1996: 71). By 1931 “most of the larger pigeons of the Marianas and of the Palau Islands were on the verge of extinction … [as was] the Palau gray duck. The Palau race of the Nicobar pigeon and the Palau ground dove (Gallicolumba canifrons) are likewise in a precarious position.... restricted to a few of the smaller islands in the southern Palau group” (Mayr 1945a).
Angaur 8.4 km2 (3.25 sq. mi.). Limestone, 61 m (200'), reef, no water. Mouse present by 1963 (Barbehenn 1974).
Babeldaob 397 km2 (153.3 sq. mi.). Old volcanic, 122 m (400'), reefs, fertile. Pacific rat, Norway rat, ship rat (introduced pre 1931) (Koroia 1934, Marshall 1962, Barbehenn 1974), cane toad (McCoid 1993).
Also: Rattus nitidus (introduced pre-1949) (Barbehenn 1974: 48).
Norway rats living a feral existence (Barbehenn 1974: 48).
Kayangel 1.7 km2 (2/3 sq. mi.). Atoll with 4 islets. Pacific rat, ship rat (Marshall 1962).
Koror 9.3 km2 (3.6 sq. mi.). Volcanic and limestone, pre-WWII Japanese town of 20 000, bombed completely in WWII, but partly rebuilt as admin. centre (Douglas 1969). Pacific rat, Norway rat (introduced pre-1931), ship rat (introduced pre-1931), mouse (Koroia 1934, Marshall 1962).
Peliliul 12.7 km2 (4.9 sq. mi.). Limestone, reefs, phosphate worked mid 20th century. Rattus nitidus (introduced pre-1945) (Barbehenn 1974: 48).
“Most of us have probably seen pictures of Peliliul Island in the Palau group, taken right after we had invaded this island. Hardly a tree was left on the island that was not torn to shreds, if one can judge from these photographs. There is a species of whiteeye on Peliliul (formerly considered even a separate

genus), which occurs nowhere else in the world than on Peliliul. It is doomed to world extinction, if its habitat on Peliliul is destroyed. I wonder whether it survived this ordeal” (Mayr 1945a).

Opportunities for island restoration
Ngerukewid Is (‘Seventy islands’, 2.59 km2 (1 sq. mi.), is a group of limestone islets, with undercut shores). “Uninhabited and protected formerly by ancient taboos”, part of proposed national park (Douglas 1969).
Wiles and Conry (1990: 41) lament that although the Ngerukewid Islands Wildlife Preserve (NIWP) “was established in 1956 to protect a segment of Palau’s rich marine and terrestrial natural resources … more than 30 years later, the preserve remains the only officially designated protected area set aside for nature conservation in the Caroline Islands”. The most important role of the reserve is to restrict hunting.
Although rodents and shrews have been introduced to the Palau islands, both rodents and shrews “appear to be absent from the NIWP … with no animals captured during a combined total of 144 trap nights ... (Wiles and Conry 1990: 62).
Papua New Guinea
(? islands in group)
Eastern part of main island, together with numerous islands to the north and east of it. (The western part is Irian Jaya, a province of Indonesia.) The total main island is said to be the world’s largest tropical island, with a total area of 808 000 km2 (Case 1996: 71).
Significant invasive land vertebrates
Pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, ship rat (Flannery 1995).
Also: Rattus praetor (Flannery 1995), and others see checklist below.
Native rats include at least 3 species of Rattus (Dwyer 1975).
R. exulans “occurs in grasslands and adjoining disturbed habitats from sea level to altitudes over 2500 m” (in Dwyer 1978: 221). “To date there is no suggestion that R. exulans is a pest species in the New Guinea Highlands, though rats are reported as damaging cacao, coconut and root crops on Bougainville (Dwyer 1978: 246). (See Dwyer (1978: 242–243) for discussion of diet of R. exulans in this area.)
Dwyer (1978: 221, 246) suggests numbers of R. exulans “may follow a 3- or 4-year cycle linked to a culturally determined cycle in the domestic pig population”. That is – as pig numbers increase, R. exulans decreases until pig herds are killed: “synchronously

Bat – R. exulans, R. praetor (pi) Bougainville – Phalanger orientalis (northern common cuscus), pig, R. exulans, R. praetor, R. rattus Buka – Phalanger orientalis, pig, R. exulans, R. praetor, R. rattus Conflict group – R. exulans Duke of York – pig, R. exulans Fergusson – pig, R. exulans Garove – R. exulans Goodenough – pig, R. exulans Karkar – pig Kiriwina (Trobriand) – pig, R. exulans Long – R. exulans Luf – Spilocuscus kraemeri (Admiralty cuscus) Manam – R. exulans Manas – Echymipera kalubu (common echymipera), pig, Spilocuscus kraemeri, R. exulans, R. praetor, R. rattus Marshall Bennett Islands – R. exulans Mioko – Phalanger orientalis, R. exulans Misima – pig, R. exulans Mussau – Spilocuscus maculatus (common spotted cuscus), R. exulans New Britian – pig, R. exulans, R. praetor (pi), R. rattus New Ireland – Thylogale browni (Northern Pademelon - a wallaby), Phalanger orientalis, Spilocuscus maculatus, pig, R. exulans, R praetor Ninigo – Spilocuscus kraemeri (pi) Nissan (Green) – pig, Phalanger orientalis, R. exulans, R. rattus, R. praetor (pi) Normanby – pig, R. exulans Rossel (Yela) – R. exulans Sideia – R. exulans, R. rattus Sudest – R. exulans Tolokiwa – R. exulans Ulu – R. rattus Umboi – Dendroiagus matschiei (Huon tree-kangaroo), Thylogale browni (pi), R. exulans Woodlark – pig, R. exulans
pi = prehistorically introduced Note: “Some near-ubiquitous introduced species such as Sus scrofa (pig) or Rattus exulans (Pacific rat) are absent from several island listings. This absence reflects only the lack of a record for such species in the existing literature or in validated accounts to which the author had access during the writing of this book” (Szalay 1994, in Flannery 1995: 410).
slaughtered by several neighbouring clans in connection with important ritual ceremonies”. Dwyer (1978: 246–247) also suggests that “activity of pigs near and in houses presumably leads to interference with, and some predation upon, R. exulans. Pigs therefore may

Atkinson and Atkinson: Land vertebrates as invasive species

reduce the impact of R. exulans in and around gardens and living quarters,” … and cautions that as pig husbandry changes, “for reasons of health and hygiene” or due to “a growing human population, R. exulans could easily be released from controls formerly exercised by pigs”.
Archaeological work (in Dwyer 1978) shows that R. exulans only appears in uppermost horizons of sites investigated. One site covered the last 1000 years – R. exulans only in the top level. “Certainly many authors have suggested that R. exulans has gained entry to New Guinea and the highlands in consequence of human impact …. I conclude that the local diversity of small terrestrial rodents in rain forests of densely populated areas of the New Guinea highlands was higher in the past than it is today and that reduction has been a consequence of habitat disturbance by men and pigs producing a smaller, less continuous area of rainforest and simplification of ground cover”. Dwyer found that the short grass communities (which are created and sustained by humans) support only R. exulans.
Eastern islands The islands off the eastern top of Papua New Guinea which have R. exulans are Misima, Trobriand (Kiriwina), Rossel (Yela), Tagula, Fergusson, Goodenough (R.H. Taylor, letter 1982).
New Ireland In New Ireland (Bismark Archipelago), at least 50 species of birds represented by 241 bird bones from five late Pleistocene and Holocene sites (Steadman et al. 1999: 2563). “… at least 12 (petrel, hawk, megapode, quail, four rails, cockatoo, two owls, and crow) are not part of the current avifauna and have not been recorded previously from New Ireland. Larger samples of bones undoubtedly would indicate more extirpated species and refine the chronology of extinction. Humans have lived on New Ireland for ca. 35,000 years, whereas most of the identified bones are 15,000 to 6,000 years old…”
“Species of mammals brought to New Ireland by humans appear at sites only after 19,000 B.P. These are phalangers (Phalanger orientalis, Spilocuscus maculatus), wallabies (Thylogale brunii), rats (Rattus praetor, Rattus exulans), pigs... and dogs ..., of which only Phalanger orientalis has been recorded from the Pleistocene strata” (Steadman et al. 1999: 2564).
Bougainville
?Pig, ?dog, ?cat, Pacific rat, ship rat (introduced 1943) (Johnson 1946).
Also: Rattus preator (Johnson 1946).
Johnson (1946) observed the Pacific rat living in native villages and readily adapting to life in camps,

but said it did not inhabit dense jungles far from habitations. The ship rat was introduced soon after US forces arrived on the island in 1943.
Nissan (Green I.) Coral island. Pig, rat (species unknown). Hartert (1926) observed that “pigs have run wild, and rats are numerous”..
Opportunities for island restoration We do not know what opportunities for restoration may remain on small islands.
Phoenix Islands (Kiribati)
(Eight islands in group)
“The Phoenix islands lie in the geographic center of the Pacific Ocean ...” (Fosberg and Stoddart 1994: 1). All islands are low-lying coral atolls. The islands were leased to the Pacific Islands Company in 1894 for coconut planting (Nelson 1922). “The group is at present uninhabited ... climatic conditions are marginal for human settlement” ... All the islands are dry, with great fluctuations in annual rainfall and periods of severe drought (Fosberg and Stoddart 1994: 4).
Significant invasive land vertebrates Goat, pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, ship rat, possibly Norway rat (introduced 1828–1840) present or formerly present on Gardner (Bryan 1942), rabbit.
Also: Sheep (Laxton 1952: 143).
Birnie Discovered and named by Emment in 1823. Never inhabited and “one of the few dry central Pacific islands not to have been mined for guano” (King 1973: 99). 1 km2 (0.1 sq. mi.). Atoll with one island and shallow brackish lagoon. Fringing reef. Uninhabited and no signs of human settlement. Almost inaccessible, very difficult landing. Pacific rat (King 1973).
Canton Discovered and reported by various American whalers and British warships and named Canton after a New Bedford whaler which was wrecked there in 1854. (Also called Mary, Mary Balcout, and Swallow.) 9 km2 (3.5 sq. mi.). Atoll with lagoon surrounded by broken rim of land. Worked for guano in late 19th century. Used for US military purposes during and after WWII, and as a stopover refuelling point by Pan American Airlines. Reinhabited by about 200 US Air Force personnel in 1969, “now an essential part of a new US missile testing system.... About 40 percent of the land area of the island is covered by man-made structures” (King 1973: 98). Feral cats and dogs (King 1973). Pacific rat (Bryan 1942).

Invasive species in the Pacific

Enderbury
Discovered in 1823. 6 km2 (2.3 sq. mi.). Atoll with one large island, without lagoon except for shallow remnants in centre. No satisfactory anchorage. Guano worked in 19th century. Communications activity but largely uninhabited (King 1973: 98).
Cat, ?Pacific rat – “The rat population is said to be large” (Bryan 1942).
“… a few feral cats still are present” – descendants of pets brought during an attempt at colonisation, from 1938 to 1940 (King 1973: 98).
Gardner (Nikumaroro)
Captain Coffin – an English captain with an Americanowned ship, the Ganges, is credited with having found the atoll in 1828 (Bryan 1942). (Also called Kimins or Kemins Island.) There is evidence that Amelia Earhart's Lockheed Electra crashed (or ditched) beside this island in 1938. She may have got ashore but died of dehydration, being unable to contact the outside world. The island received 0.17 inches of rain in 1938 (NZ National Radio 1992). 4 km2 (1.6 sq. mi.). Atoll with two islets almost enclosing lagoon. Fringing reef.
Coconut groves. Dry. Settled in 1937 from Gilbert and Ellice but settlement failed in 1955 due to drought – inhabitants were evacuated in 1963 (Douglas 1969, King 1973).
?Dog, ?cat, Pacific rat, possibly Norway rat (introduced 1828-1840) present or formerly present (Bryan 1942).
“Possible feral domestic animals” (Douglas 1969). Gilbertese left behind cats, dogs and chickens (King 1973).
Wilkes (1845 in Bryan 1942) observed: “Birds were numerous on the island, and very tame; the tropicbirds so much so … Besides birds, a large rat …“ presumably the Norway rat, but this has since disappeared” [?].
Hull (Orona)
3.8 km2 (1.5 sq. mi.). Atoll with lagoon and 24 islets forming broken rim. Polynesian ruins. Coconut plantations, 1938 settlement from Gilbert and Ellice failed in 1955 due to drought – inhabitants evacuated in 1963. Uninhabited (Douglas 1969, King 1973).
“Feral pigs, dogs, cats etc.” left behind by Gilbertese (Douglas 1969). Pacific rat (Peale 1848, Bryan 1942).
Ellis (1936) writing about an 1887 visit, describes the “immense numbers of rats, particularly about the camp … A species of native rat, somewhat smaller in size than the common one and certainly not so

repulsive, these were particularly active and could climb to places that would be inaccessible to the rat of our cities. Each night some would be at work noisily endeavouring to get at the provisions kept under our bunks, often scampering over us and making themselves generally objectionable.”
McKean
Discovered by Wilkes in 1840.
0.5 km2 (0.2 sq. mi.). Atoll with one islet and central landlocked lagoon, fringing reef. Guano worked in late 19th century.
According to King (1973: 99) McKean “has no introduced predators” and little sign of human activity.
Phoenix
“One ship, Phoenix, under command of Captain Moore, was in this region in 1794” (Bryan 1942). “No prehistoric ruins have been found.”
0.5 km2 (0.2 sq. mi.). Atoll with one island and freshwater pools in centre, fringing reef. Worked for guano in late 19th century, uninhabited since (King 1973: 99).
“No … rats were noted” (Bryan 1942). Rabbits.
“In 1924, white, yellow and brown ex-domestic rabbits were fairly numerous” (Bryan 1942). These were released at the time of guano working (1859–1871) (Douglas 1969). Rabbits (estimates vary from 100 to 1000 – “evidently kept in check by periodic harvesting, along with some seabirds, by the crews of copra boats that service the Line Islands” (King 1973: 99). The rabbits “…appeared to be sharing their burrows with the petrels and shearwaters and one had to step carefully to avoid crushing rabbits and birds wherever one went. They were in very poor condition and, although when chased they would be off like a rocket for a hundred yards or so, they soon gave a despairing squeak and lay still with their ears back, ready to be captured…. I am told that rabbits never drink, certainly those at Phoenix could not have, for though we dug six wells down to 12 feet we found nothing but salt water” (Maude and Maude 1952).
Sydney
Discovered by Captain Emment in 1823.
4.4 km2 (1.7 sq. mi.). Atoll with enclosed saline lagoon, completely landlocked, one island, fringing reef. Possibly some Polynesian ruins. Worked for guano in late 19th century by J.T. Arundel and Co. Settled from Gilbert and Elllice in 1937–1955 but settlement abandoned due to drought.
Feral pigs (Bryan 1942). Cat, dog, Pacific rat, ship rat (introduced 1885) (Ellis 1936, King 1973).
“One dog seen in 1968 may be the last on the island” (King 1973: 99).
Arundel (1890) writes: “On moonlight nights I have

58

Atkinson and Atkinson: Land vertebrates as invasive species

often seen hundreds of rats gathered together, and much disturbed running to and fro … We have frequently caught 100 a night in tubs made into traps in our store, and I have never visited an island however small or barren, without finding these animals living upon it.”
The Lorenzo was wrecked in 1884/85 and ship rats got ashore (Ellis 1936).
Peale (in Poesch 1961), visiting the island in 1841 states: “… not a single land bird was seen by us, but great numbers of rats.”
Opportunities for island restoration Several of these islands are bird sanctuaries (see Douglas 1969).
Enderbury – largely uninhabited – “the most important green sea turtle breeding island in the south central Pacific” (King 1973: 99).
Birnie – “the island has great value because it is nearly in an undisturbed state” (King 1973: 99).
McKean – “has no introduced predators” and little sign of human activity (King (1973: 99).
Consider removing rabbits from Phoenix, if they are still present.
Pitcairn Group (UK) (Four islands in group)
Significant invasive land vertebrates Goat, cat, Pacific rat, mouse. (Formerly pig and rabbit.)
Ducie 0.8 km2 (0.3 sq. mi.). Low coral atoll with lagoon. Partly wooded. Remote and rarely visited. Pacific rat (Williams 1960).
Henderson Polynesian settlement from as early as 700 AD. “…increasingly occupied for c. 500 years from 1000 AD” (Vickery 1994). “Discovered by European voyagers in 1606, at which time it had no human inhabitants” (Steadman and Olson 1985: 6191). 37 km2 (14.3 sq. mi.) (Case 1996:71). Elevated coral atoll, 30 m. (100'), with fringing reef, undercut precipitous cliffs, flat top with deeply pitted surface, no running water. Densely wooded including many endemic tree species. Visited by Pitcairn islanders for wood. Otherwise not altered by humans. Relatively inaccessible. Pacific rat (Pearce 1994). ?Mouse.

“ … of those introduced, only the Pacific rat … and perhaps the house mouse … survive today” (Steadman and Olson 1985: 6191).
“Goats were first taken to Henderson from Pitcairn in 1843, but through inadvertence were not landed before the vessel left … Three were, however, released during the visit of the Whitney Expedition in 1923 … but had disappeared by the time of the Mangarevan Expedition in 1934. Pigs were landed … in 1912, but of these there is no subsequent record. Mice are mentioned as being numerous at the north landing ... [in 1909] but are not otherwise recorded. The only numerous introduced mammal is the Polynesian rat. [It was] found ... there in 1819. Bank mentioned it as numerous at the north landing in 1909 …” (Fosberg et al. 1983: 18–19).
1987 excavations on Henderson Island, when combined with earlier excavations, “show that the resident avifauna of Henderson Island has lost two to five species of seabirds and three species of landbirds [pigeons] since the arrival of humans more than 800 years ago” (Schubel and Steadman 1989).
No introduced bird species (Case 1996: 71).
Oeno
0.6 km2 (0.25 sq. mi.). Low coral atoll with typical atoll vegetation. Some coconuts planted, visited occasionally by Pitcairn islanders. Largely undisturbed.
Pacific rat (Williams 1960, Pearce 1994).
Pitcairn
Discovered by Cartaret in 1767. Had been inhabited by Polynesians. Settled in 1780 by Bounty mutineers. The community moved to Norfolk I. in 1856, but some returned to Pitcairn in 1858. Pitcairn “makes a welcome pausing place for the great crowded passenger liners and for the freighters that pass on the average weekly” (Moverly 1953: 65).
486 hectares (1200 acres). High volcanic, 304 m (1000'). Rich deep soil. 80 in. rain p.a. Temp. 65-82°F. Luxuriant evergreen vegetation. Small farming community with cultivated areas.
Feral goats (Douglas 1969). ?Pigs. Dogs - domesticated? (Moverly 1953), cats, fowls?
Pacific rat - currently being eradicated, though a first eradication attempt has failed. No other rats present (B. D. Bell, pers. comm. 1999). Mouse (introduced c. 1942) (Moverly 1953).
“Rats are very common... They attack citrus fruit at all stages; they eat the seeds both before and during germination, they destroy the blossoms, and they eat the fruit on the trees before it ripens. Orange trees are unpruned and grow straight up to a great height

Invasive species in the Pacific

in the scrubby jungle, but only a metal collar round the trunk can discourage the rats. Mice are increasing. They came in packing materials about six years ago. Despite the very real threat of these rodents to the orange industry the inhabitants most stupidly hunt with dogs and shoot even the most domesticated of cats.... There is a large flock of goats roaming the islands … They are individually marked and owned and are the main supply of meat…. Goats and fowls are the gardener’s worst enemies here, because fencing is almost unknown” (Moverly 1953: 64). Serious soil erosion follows the deforestation caused by the goats (Moverly 1953: 65)
Only one land bird present (Moverly 1953). “No extinct forms are known, though, judging from the present avifauna of Henderson, it is likely that there were once other resident land-birds on Pitcairn that have been exterminated as a result of settlement; and place-names and traditions indicate that all the petrels breeding on the other islands in the groups as well as two, perhaps even three, species of Sula and the greater frigate bird once bred there, but have since been eaten out of existence” (Williams 1960).
Survival of several species of petrel is “severely threatened by predation from the introduced Pacific rat” (Vickery 1994).
Opportunities for island restoration
Ducie and/or Henderson? Douglas remarks that these are not adequately studied.
Pitcairn? Some reafforestation begun in 1964 (Douglas 1969). Oeno?
Henderson is described by Vickery (1994) as “the world’s only raised coral atoll that is virtually intact, and supports a suite of endemic plants and animals”. It has been designated a World Heritage Site. Pitcairn islanders visit Henderson to cut trees for carving, especially miro (Thespesia populnea). “They are unlikely to agree to any conservation measures that do not provide them some benefits and thus, one key aspect of the management plan is the development of miro as a sustainable resource” (Vickery 1994).
Petrels breed on Henderson and rats are prevalent, but eradicating rats has been considered “impractical given its size, [around] 37 square kilometres” (Pearce 1994). The next best option has been suggested to be eradicating the rats from Oeno “a nearby coral island that covers just 65 hectares … and trust that the birds have the wit to utilise it,” (Pearce 1994). Others suggest that “eventually” rats may be eradicated from Henderson itself (Nuttall 1994).

In addition, “action [is] needed to ensure that [Pacific rats] were not joined by modern rats from passing cruise ships and yachts.” In the opinion of Mr Hepburn, a consultant for the British Government: “The brown rat … would probably kill the island's indigenous Henderson warbler, Henderson lorikeet, Henderson rail – a wading bird – and Henderson fruit dove” (Nuttall 1994).
On Henderson: “All of the land birds are considered to be endemic … about 33% of the species of insects and gastropods thus far collected are endemic” (Steadman and Olson 1985: 6191).
With Henderson in mind, Steadman and Olson (1985: 6191) note: “Certain endangered species, such as Ducula galeata, might effectively be preserved by reintroduction to abandoned islands that they occupied before human intervention.”
Wildlife Management International (from New Zealand) currently have a contract to eradicate the Pacific rat from Pitcairn (B. D. Bell, pers. comm. 1999).
Rennell and Bellona (Solomon Is) (Two islands)
Rennell 825 km2 (318.5 sq. mi.) (Wolff 1969). 91 m (300') raised atoll, with cliffs and central depression with lake. Honeycombed limestone surface with Pandanus scrub. Polynesian population – occupied for at least five centuries (J. Diamond, pers. comm. 1982).
Significant invasive land vertebrates Pacific rat. No other rats or other introduced land mammals (Wolff 1969).
(Formerly goat, pig, dog.)
Said to have been no dogs, cats, or pigs present in 1929. Pigs were introduced by missionaries in 1934 but were all killed and eaten by natives. Danish expedition of 1951 found a few dogs but no pigs or cats on western end of island. British expedition in 1953 found cats, dogs (3), and a small herd of goats at Hatuna village at eastern end (Bradley 1955 in Hill 1956).
Rennell Island grey teal, extinct 1959 (King 1981).
Bellona 21.6 km2 (8.3 sq. mi.) (Wolff 1969). 76 m (250') raised atoll with honeycombed limestone surface.
Significant invasive land vertebrates Pacific rat. No other rats or introduced land mammals (Wolff 1969).

Atkinson and Atkinson: Land vertebrates as invasive species

Opportunities for island restoration “Rennell is the world’s largest raised atoll. No traders of other nations brought ship rats or house cats. The result has been that the bird fauna has not been disturbed appreciably. Of the 33 land and freshwater forms known to nest on the island, 19 (57%) are to be found nowhere else. The Australian Government has made great efforts to keep the island and its fauna inviolate. As a result of this action, as well as its good luck and freedom from predators, the birds are as nearly in their natural state as any in the world” (Hamlin 1931 in Greenway 1967).
Cliffs may have been sufficient to exclude beaching by boats … and hence protect island from predator introduction (J. Diamond, pers. comm. 1982).
Wolff (1969), visiting the islands in 1965, found Rattus exulans to be the only introduced land mammal.
Rotuma (Fiji) (One island)
Politically part of Fiji but separated by 450 km (Zuy et al. 1988). 43 km2 (17 sq. mi.) (Zuy et al. 1988). 256 m (840') volcanic, fringing reef. Upper slopes wooded, some swamps. 6 small islets round coast. Hot and wet. Copra, tropical fruit and cotton cultivation.
Significant invasive land vertebrates Cattle, goat, pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, ?other rat species.
Cattle, horses, pigs, goats, dogs and cats, described as “domestic” by Zuy et al. (1988).
“The rat, Rattus exulans, is widespread from the houses of the coast to the gardens and plantations of the central plateau.... it is likely that R. rattus and/or R. norvegicus are also present” (Zuy et al. 1988).
One bird species introduced. None known to be extinct (Case 1996: 71).
Opportunities for island restoration Unknown.
Samoan Islands (W: Independent, E: USA) (11 islands in group, W: 4, E: 7.)

Cats “have become wild in great numbers, and prove most destructive to many kinds of birds” (Stair 1897).
Three bird species introduced, at least two bird species extinct (Case 1996: 71). See King (1973: 98) for some extinction details. Samoan wood rail, extinct 1873 (King 1981).
Samoa
Aleipata Islands Four small islands- Nu’utele, Nu’ulua, Namu’a, and Fanuatapu – at eastern end of Upolu, highly eroded remains of tuff cones (Whistler 1983: 228).
On Nu’utele “The feral pigs present...” (Whistler 1983: 230).
On Namu’a “A small herd of feral goats (possibly only five individuals)...” (Whistler 1983: 230).
On Faunuatapu, there are no goats or pigs present (Whistler 1983: 232).
Savai’i 1821 km2 (703 sq. mi.). Volcanic dome, 1858 m (6096'), still active. Some fringing reef. Cultivated for coconuts. Timber extraction from rainforest.
Wild cattle, wild pigs, dog, cat, Pacific rat (K. A. Wodzicki, pers. comm.). Red-vented bulbul (Lever 1987: 318).
The Savai’i rail (Pareudiastes pacificus – probably flightless) became extinct during the last 100 years (1845–1945) (Mayr 1945a). “The Samoan rail is also believed to have been exterminated within a few years of rats escaping from visiting whalers” (Roots 1976).
Upolu R. L. Stevenson (in Derrick 1951) describes the effect of a hurricane which wrecked 12 out of 13 ships in Apia harbour, in 1889.

Invasive species in the Pacific

1114 km2 (430 sq. mi.). High volcanic, 1100 m (3608'), backbone ridge with string of old volcanic cones. Some fringing reef. Banana and copra cultivation. Pacific rat, Norway rat (introduced 1762–1923), ship rat (introduced 1841–1923). Jungle myna (Lever 1987: 504), possibly Indian myna (Lever 1987: 499, 504), red-vented bulbul (Lever 1987: 318).
All three rat species caught in Apia in 1924–25 (Buxton and Hopkins 1927).
The Samoan wood rail (Pareudiastes pacificus) is thought to have been “extirpated by imported rats and cats, which are thought to have been introduced by whaling ships. …Whitmee, 1974, was of the opinion that it occurred on Upolo also” (Greenway 1967).
American Samoa
Writing of American Samoa, King (1973: 98) stated: “The black rat is found on Tutuila, and may be present on some of the others as well. Polynesian rats have been observed on all islands of this group.”
“The dense interiors of Tutuila and Tau are visited by Samoans only rarely on hunting forays after wild pigs” (King 1973: 98).
Rose Atoll 7000 m2 (1.8 acres). Low coral atoll with two reef islets. Many seabirds. Pacific rat - probably (Sachet 1954).
Swains Island Part of Tokelau islands until annexed by USA in 1925. 2.59 km2 (1 sq. mi.). Atoll with freshwater lagoon. Coconut, banana and taro cultivation. Tokelau labour. Pig, dog, cat (King 1973: 98). Pacific rat.
“Polynesian rats (Rattus exulans) are plentiful and are particularly numerous in and on the piles of coconut husks left after copra-harvesting operations” (Clapp 1968).
Coulter (1941) reported that before poisoning it was estimated that 20% of the coconut crop was damaged by rats.
In the opinion of King (1973: 98), this island “would be of little value as a sanctuary”.
Tutuila 135 km2 (52 sq. mi.). Volcanic, 653 m (2141'), with chain of mountains for 25 miles, fringing reef in southeast. Densely wooded (Douglas 1969). Coconut cultivation. “Wild pigs” (King 1973: 98). Pacific rat, ship rat (introduced 1865–1973), Norway rat (introduced pre1924?) (S. Anderson, letter 1978) (Flannery 1995). Mouse (Brenchley 1873). Red-vented bulbul (King

1973: 98). Possibly Indian myna, though it is uncertain whether this has established. (Lever 1987: 499).
“The black rat is found on Tutuila, and may be present on some of the others as well. Polynesian rats have been observed on all islands of this group” (i.e. all seven islands of American Samoa). … “The Mao or Giant Honeyeater (Gymnomyza samoensis) has been extirpated from Tutuila, although it still can be found occasionally in Western Samoa. The sooty rail (Porzana titabuensis) from Tau has not been seen in recent years …” (King 1973).
Opportunities for island restoration
Samoa The Aleipata Islands [are these close enough for rats to swim?] Uninhabited? Dense vegetation: “…distinct from the main islands (Upolu and Savai’i in both their flora and their vegetation (Whistler 1983: 241).
Douglas (1969) recommends: Protection of some parts of upper slopes of cone on Savai’i, to safeguard endemics and interesting colonisation of lava flows. Protection of upper slopes of Mt Tofua, on Upolu.
American Samoa King (1973: 98) commented: “There are no legally recognised nature sanctuaries in American Samoa”.
Tutuila and Tau have densely vegetated, uninhabited interiors. “A recently discovered colony of three and possibly four procellariid species [petrels and shearwaters] in the mountains of Tau, attests to the relatively unaltered nature of the interior of this island” (R. Crossin, pers. comm., King 1973: 98).
Likewise, Douglas (1969) recommends: Protection of mountain sites to safeguard endemic species, on Tutuila.
Rose atoll – is R. exulans the only introduced predator? …has forest, and substantial seabird populations. In the opinion of King (1973: 98), Rose “should be given legal status as a sanctuary”.
Santa Cruz Is (Solomon Is)
(14 islands total)
The Santa Cruz group (incl. Swallow (Tuwo), Tikopia, Mitre, Cherry, Duff) is largely volcanic. Vanikoro is a recent volcano, with a fringing reef and difficult landing. Tinakula is an active volcano, 671 m (2200'), with a barren summit. Swallow (with mixed Polynesian/ Melanesian population) is made up of ten islands - fragments of a raised atoll. Tikopia (Polynesian and much studied by anthropologists) is volcanic, 1235', with crater lake and fringing reef. Cherry (Anuta) island has a reef and difficult landing. Mitre (Fatutaka) is steep and

rocky with no vegetation. The Duff or Wilson islands (3 in total) are volcanic.
Significant invasive land vertebrates Pig, Pacific rat, ship rat.
Tikopia Colonised 2000 years ago (see Kirch and Yen 1982).
Pacific rat. (Formerly pig and dog, and also formerly Rattus praetor.)
“The occurrence of R. praetor is interesting, as it represents the easternmost penetration of this originally New Guinean species. Its remains are not present in the lowest levels of the site, and it has not been recorded from the island in historic times, suggesting that it may now be extinct there. Both pigs and dogs were rare or extinct by the early historic period, although their remains are abundant in early prehistoric levels” (Flannery 1995: 41).
Opportunities for island restoration Unknown.
Society Islands (French Polynesia) (14 islands in group)
Total area: 1550 km2 (599 sq. mi.) (Case 1996: 71).
Significant invasive land vertebrates Cattle, goat, pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, Norway rat, ship rat, mouse, Indian myna, red-vented bulbul probably established (Lever 1987: 318).
Also: donkey, harrier (R. Hay, pers. comm. 1999).
Seitre and Seitre (1992: 215) provide a summary of the situation. All the endemic birds in French Polynesia are considered threatened or endangered (15 species and 40 subspecies). Polynesians brought with them pigs, dogs, Pacific rats and chickens. “Europeans introduced goats, sheep, cattle, horses, rabbits and domestic cats, as well as, unintentionally, roof rats Rattus rattus, brown rats Rattus norvegicus and house mice Mus musculus. Various birds came much later.… introductions of European pests could have been earlier than is generally believed and could partly explain why at least five native species were never seen again after Cook’s passage, although they had survived 1000 years of Polynesian presence. Only one species, the Marquesas fruit dove Ptilinopus mercierii, has become extinct during the twentieth century, but many other bird species have suffered range reductions and their current status is very poorly known.… As well as hunting and habitat destruction, it appears that introduced predators play a ma-

jor role, with the roof rat Rattus rattus being the most dangerous.”
Rattus rattus is “the main danger” to Vini lories. “Although Vini and Rattus coexist on some islands, it is probably only a temporary phenomenon. Rats proliferate in the lowlands where birds soon disappear, the remaining population being driven to higher altitudes (as has happened in Ua Pou). While this habitat is not optimal for rats they do invade it as their numbers increase and force the birds to extinction” (Seitre and Seitre 1992: 219).
Flycatchers are abundant only where Rattus rattus is absent (Seitre and Seitre 1992: 220).
The Pacific rat “can be a significant predator” for the Tuamotu sandpiper Prosobonia cancellata, which “has an extremely limited range on a few atoll islets (motus)” (see Seitre and Seitre 1992: 219).
“Feral cats contributed to the extinction of many species and they may be the direct cause of extirpation of ground doves Gallicolumba spp. on many islands (Seitre and Seitre 1992: 217)
Twelve bird species introduced, at least 12 bird species extinct (Case 1996: 71).
Indian myna present on: Bellingshausen, Huahine, Moorea, Mopelia, Raiatea, Scilly (Fenuaura), Tahaa, Tahiti (details in Lever 1987: 499, from Holyoak and Thibault 1984).
Bora Bora (Pora-Pora) 37.6 km2 (14.5 sq. mi.). High volcanic, 579 m (1936'). Reef islands. ‘Rest and recreation’ centre for US armed forces in WWII.
Pacific rat (Wallace and Rosen 1965), ship rat (introduced pre-1920) (S. Anderson, letter 1978).
Huahine
Archaeological evidence of Polynesian habitation (from as early as AD 780): “…bones of … dog, chicken, and rat were present. The absence of pig bones should be noted …” (Emory 1979: 202). Visited by Cook in 1773, and called by him ‘Huaheine’. 78 km2 (30 sq. mi.). Twin islands, Huahine Nui and Huahine Iti, volcanic, to 456 m (1497'). Two lakes.
“Feral pigs and fowl” (Douglas 1969). Pacific rat (Wallace and Rosen 1965). Indian myna (Lever 1987: 499).
Meetia (Mehetia)
High volcanic to 433 m (1427'), with reef, but no lagoon.

Invasive species in the Pacific

Moorea Visited by Cook in 1773 and called by him ‘Eimeo’. Also later called Duke of York Island. 132 km2 (51 sq. mi.). High volcanic, 1121 m (3975'). Reef. Pacific rat (R.H. Taylor, letter 1982), Norway rat (introduced pre-1922), ship rat (introduced pre-1922) (S. Anderson, letter 1978). Indian myna (Lever 1987: 499).
In 1841: “The woods swarmed with rats [presumably the Pacific rat], which came out many at a time when the natives commenced opening cocoa nuts for us” (Peale in Poesch 1961).
Rats may be a contributing factor in the decline of Partula land snails on Moorea (and other islands), although their main predator is Euglandina, an introduced carnivorous snail (see Tudge 1992).
Raiatea Visited by Cook in 1773 and called by him ‘Uliatea’. “Source island for New Zealand Maori population” ? (Douglas 1969). High volcanic to 1033 m (3389'). Reef. Pacific rat (Wallace and Rosen 1965). Indian myna (Lever 1987: 499).
“We also noticed that rats, which are such a bane on Otaheite [Tahiti] that at night the natives wrap up their feet to prevent them being bitten, were much scarcer here, although we could not observe that the natives took any measures to destroy them” (Sparrman 1953).
Raiatea parakeet, extinct 1774 (King 1981).
Scilly (Fenuaura) Atoll. Pacific rat (R.H. Taylor, letter 1982). Indian myna (Lever 1987: 499).
Tahaa 98.4 km2 (38 sq. mi.). High volcanic, 579 m (1936'). Within same barrier reef as Raiatea I. Pacific rat (Wallace and Rosen 1965). Indian myna (Lever 1987: 499).
Tahiti Visited by Cook in 1773 and called by him ‘Otaheite’. 1000 km2 (386 sq. mi.). High volcanic to 2237 m (7339'). Reef. Wet. “Feral cattle … goats and pigs” (Douglas 1969). Pacific rat (Peale 1848), Norway rat (introduced pre1921), ship rat (introduced pre-1921) (S. Anderson, letter 1978). Indian myna (Lever 1987: 499), redvented bulbul – probably established (Lever 1987: 318).

Sparrman (1953) visited Tahiti with Cook in 1773: “The pig and the dog, which are eaten as food, are the only quadrupeds, except for an unconscionable number of rats which, despite being a great pest, must nevertheless be regarded as a public benefaction, since the natives do not gather up their fruit and vegetable refuse which they strew about; the rats by devouring it thus prevent the air from becoming infected by the putrid odours emanating therefrom.”
Goin (1932) suggests the Pacific rat has been driven out by the ship rat.
Tahiti parakeet, extinct 1844, Tahiti red-billed rail, extinct 1925 (King 1981).
Opportunities for island restoration “Rapid action to eradicate introduced predators, coupled with translocations, would be the most effective way to ensure the survival of the remaining bird species” (Seitre and Seitre 1992: 215).
Solomon Islands
The capital of the Solomons is Honiara on Guadalcanal. “The longest islands (Malaita and Isabel) are about 110 miles in length, with an area of some 1,600 to 1,700 square miles [4144 to 4403 km2], the largest (Guadalcanal) covers 2,500 square miles [6475 km2]…” (Lever 1937).
Significant invasive land vertebrates Pig, ?dog, cat, Pacific rat, ship rat (Friend 1971, M. Efford, pers. comm. 1978), mouse. Cane toad (Lever 1945). Indian myna (Lever 1987: 500).
Also: Rattus preator (Johnson 1946), Phalanger orientalis (northern common cuscus) (Flannery 1995).
“The value of a wife, amongst these islands, is generally estimated at about three pigs, which, when a man is able to get them, entitle him to the hand of a dusky beauty” (Markham 1872).
One bird species known to be introduced, at least two bird species extinct (Case 1996: 71).
Indian mynas present on: Guadalcanal, Russel, and the Olu Malau (Three Sisters) (Lever 1987: 500).
Guadalcanal Pig, ?dog, cat, Pacific rat, ship rat (introduced pre1920), mouse (Rowe 1967), (J. Schonewald, letter, 1979). Indian myna (Lever 1987: 500). Also: Phalanger orientalis (Northern common Cuscus) (Flannery 1995).
Possibly Rattus preator (Rowe 1967).

Malaita
Pig, Pacific rat, ship rat (introduced 1945–59) (Rowe 1967).
Also: Phalanger orientalis (northern common cuscus) (Flannery 1995).
“Serious damage by rats to cocoa pods … Circumstantial evidence suggests that damage to crops followed the introduction of R. rattus, probably when units of the labour corps and surplus war equipment were shipped from Guadacanal after the war” (Rowe 1967).
San Cristobal
Pig, Pacific rat, ship rat (Flannery 1995).
Also: Phalanger orientalis (northern common cuscus) (Flannery 1995).
The San Cristobal rail (Edithornis silvestris) was still extant in 1944–45 (Mayr 1945a).
Opportunities for island restoration

Note: “Some near-ubiquitous introduced species such as Sus scrofa (Pig) or Rattus exulans (Pacific Rat) are absent from several island listings. This absence reflects only the lack of a record for such species in the existing literature or in validated accounts to which the author had access during the writing of this book” (Szalay 1994, in Flannery 1995: 410).

Tokelau Islands (NZ) (Three islands in group)
Total area 1012 hectares (2500 acres). Group of 3 atolls, low, with seasonal rain.
Significant invasive land vertebrates Pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat.
“All [islands] have populations of Polynesian rats and, at times, dogs” (Kirkpatrick 1966b in King 1973: 97).
“On Atafu, like on the two other islands of Nukunonu and Fakaofo, Polynesian rats (Rattus exulans) damage only green coconuts on the palms … these nuts, upon being gnawed by rats fall to the ground and disintegrate” (Wodzicki 1973: 44).
Atafu 223 hectares (550 acres). 42 reef islets. ?Cat (Kirkpatrick 1966), Pacific rat (Wodzicki 1972), ?Norway rat.
An unconfirmed report (in 1982) that R. norvegicus had reached Atafu during the previous two or three years (K. Wodzicki, pers. comm.).
Fakaofo 263 hectares (650 acres). 61 reef islets. Dense population, copra growing. ?Cat (Kirkpatrick 1966), Pacific rat (Wodzicki 1972).
Nukunono 546 hectares (1350 acres). 24 reef islets. ?Cat (Kirkpatrick 1966), Pacific rat (Wodzicki 1972).
Opportunities for island restoration Fakaofo “is undoubtedly the most valuable islet in the group” from the point of view of breeding seabirds (King 1973: 97).
“R. exulans is the only rodent present on Nukunono atoll” (Wodzicki 1972).
Greenway (1967) writes: “No endemic species are to be found on them and no populations are known to have been extirpated. They [the Tokelau islands] have had little contact with European or American civilization”.
Tongan Islands (75 islands in group)
Discovered in 1616 by two Dutch navigators, Schouten and Lemaire, who visited Niuatoputapu and Niuafoou. Tasman visited ’Eua, Tongatapu, Nomuka (which he named Middleburgh, Amsterdam, Rotterdam respectively) in 1643. Sallis visited Niuatoputapu in 1767. Cook visited

several islands on his second voyage (1773–74) and spent three months in the islands on his third voyage in 1777. The mutiny on the Bounty took place somewhere between Nomuka and Tofua (in the Ha’apai group), in 1789. Many other ships called. Mission activities from 1822 to 1890. Troops stationed during WWII. Total area: 670.8 km2 (259 sq. mi.). Scattered group of volcanic and limestone islands. Three main island groups:
Tongatapu group: e.g. Tongatapu, ’Eua
Ha’apai group: low-lying coral formations, e.g. Nomuka, Tofua
Vava’u group: high and mountainous, e.g. Uta Vava’u, Hunga
Outlying islands: e.g. Niuatoputapu, Tafahi, Niuafo’ou
Significant invasive land vertebrates Pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, ship rat, Norway rat, mouse, rabbit (on Tongatapu). Jungle myna (Rinke 1986). Red-vented bulbul (Lever 1987: 318).
Also: Horse.
Twibell (1973) trapped R. norvegicus, R. rattus, R. exulans, on five islands, but no mice were caught, observed or reported, contrary to other reports (e.g. Carter et al. 1945).
The arrival dates for the Norway rat, and the ship rat “are not known, but are believed to be … since the increase of regular shipping trade and the construction of wharves” (Twibell 1973).
Martin (1818: 267–71) describes hunting of rats, presumably the Pacific rat, with bows and arrows, by chiefs.
The jungle myna has “recently colonised the island of Niuafo’ou, apparently without human assistance, and may compete with the lories [Vini australis] for nesting sites...” (Rinke 1986).
Red-vented bulbul present on Niuafo’ou (released 1928-29), ’Eua and Tongatapu (Lever 1987: 317).
’Eua
87.8 km2 (33.9 sq. mi.). Volcanic, 329 m (1078'). Pacific rat (Gill 1987). Red-vented bulbul (Lever 1987: 317).
“Protection of some sites recommended in order to safeguard some remaining native vegetation including most of interesting Tongan species” (Douglas 1969).
Hunga 4.8 km2 (1.85 sq. mi.). 75 m (245'), sheer cliff coastline. Pacific rat (Martin 1818 in Waite 1897).

Late 15.5 km2 (6 sq. mi.). High volcanic, 518 m (1700'), cliffs. Periodically visited for fishing and collecting copra. “Wild pigs” (Douglas 1969). Ship rat (introduced pre-1978) (W.R. Sykes, letters 1979/80).
Tongatapu 257 km2 (99.24 sq. mi.). Raised limestone, 82 m (270'), lake complex in centre of island. Cliffbound. Reefs and islets. Goat, pig, dog, rabbit, Pacific rat, Norway rat, ship rat (Brenchley 1873: 134, Twibell 1973, D. R. Stoddart 1975). Red-vented bulbul (Lever 1987: 317).
Heyerdahl (1952) comments that no pre-European dogs were present, although their name was known.
Brenchley (1873: 134) comments that there are “no indigenous mammals”, but that rats and rabbits had been “imported”. As he considered the Pacific rat indigenous, it seems likely that one of the other rat species had reached Tongatapu by 1865.
Twibell (1973) discusses varying damage to food crops by the three rat species.
Opportunities for island restoration Unknown.
Tuamotu Islands (French Polynesia) (76 islands in group)
The Tuamotu Islands together with the Society, Rapa, Austral, Gambier (Mangareva), and Marquesas Islands are administered from one centre – the town of Papeete, on Tahiti. Total area: 855 km2 (330 sq. mi.) (Case 1996: 72). All are low coral islands except Makatea. Hot and wet, within hurricane belt, water scarce. Thin soils. French nuclear tests on Fangataufa, Mururoa. Base for French nuclear weapons test programme in Pacific on Anaa atoll.
Significant invasive land vertebrates ?Pig, dog, cat, Pacific rat, Norway rat, ship rat, mouse (Cassin 1958). Indian myna (Lever 1987: 499).
“Introduced dogs, cats and rats, also poultry, all feral” (Douglas 1969).
No pigs in pre-European times (Heyerdahl 1952).
Two bird species introduced, none known to be extinct (Case 1996: 72).
Indian myna present on Hao and Mururoa (Lever 1987: 499).
Ahunui, Aratika Pacific rat (R.H. Taylor, letter 1982).

Atkinson and Atkinson: Land vertebrates as invasive species

Beechey (1968: 222 (1831)), visited the island in 1826: “In their huts we found calabashes of water suspended to the roof, mats, baskets, and every thing calculated for a sea-voyage; and not far from them a plentiful store of fish, raised about four feet above the ground, out of the reach of the rats, which were very numerous”.
Disappointment Is Pacific rat (Peale 1848, R.H. Taylor, letter 1982).
Fakarava (Fakareva) Atoll with islets.
Pacific rat, Norway rat, ship rat (Dumbleton 1955).
Dumbleton (1955) commented: “… the species responsible for the damage are said to be Rattus rattus …. R. norvegicus is present in at least some villages. It is stated that where only the Polynesia rat Rattus exulans is present, no damage is done to coconuts. It is believed that rats destroy 50% of the coconut crop on Fakarava, and in some localities 75%–100% of the crop is destroyed”.
Hao Airstrip built for use in French nuclear weapons test programme. Coconut plantations.
Dog, ?Pacific rat (Lucett 1851: 247). Indian myna (Lever 1987: 499).
“They have no quadrupeds, save a few wretched dogs which they keep for eating, and a small species of rat which infects the islands in myriads” (Lucett 1851: 247).
Hiti Pacific rat (R.H. Taylor, letter 1982).
Kakarawa Pacific rat (R.H. Taylor, letter 1982).
Maria and Menihi Pacific rat (R.H. Taylor, letter 1982).
Makatea Mined for phosphate in early 20th century. Is a shipping port at Temao, “where are great storage warehouses, and where launches and boats are drawn up when not in use. It is to Temao that passengers and freight come by power launches from steamers lying out in deep water” (Wilder 1934).
28 km2 (10.8 sq. mi.). Raised atoll 111 m (230'), cliff, fringing reef. Phosphates once worked with labour force imported from Austral Is, who have since returned.
Rat (species unknown), mouse (Wilder 1934).
Thibault and Guyot (1987) in their study of changes in the avifauna of Makatea, suggest that some

extinctions between the 19th and 20th centuries may be due in part to the “introduction of a predator (e.g. Rattus sp.)”.
Nukutipipi 5 km2 (1.9 sq. mi.), volcanic, “one of the tiniest low-lying islands of the Tuamotu archipelago” (Salvat and Salvat 1992: 1). Pacific rat (R.H. Taylor, letter 1982).
“No cats, dogs, pigs or other mammals are found in the atoll and the past land-owner, Mr. Madec, was very sensitive to the natural ecosystem of the islands remaining vigilant about introductions. Rattus exulans is present.” No introduced birds are present (Salvat and Salvat 1992: 6, 5).
Rangiroa Atoll with 241 islands, reef. Coconut plantations, pearl fishery, airstrip. Cat, Pacific rat.
“On Rangiroa … it seems that cats are present on most of the motu, but there are some remote ones which are predator-free (except R. exulans) and this is where the densest populations of bristle-thighed curlew occur and where ground doves and lorikeets have hung on” (R. Hay, pers. comm. 1999).
Raraka Pacific rat (R.H. Taylor, letter 1982).
Raroia 9 km2 (3.5 sq. mi.). Atoll with many islets around lagoon.
Dog, cat, Pacific rat, ship rat (introduced c. 1855– 75) (Morrison 1954).
“According to the people of Raroia, this grey rat [R. rattus] appeared on Raroia Atoll only after the development of the commercial copra trade about a century ago” (Morrison 1954).
Morrison (1954) characterises R. exulans as having “no fear of man” and living on seeds and fruit, while R. rattus is “larger and greyer” and “secretive, running away to hide when found at night”, and feeding on the coconut both green on the tree and ripe on the ground.
The rats are most uncommon around the villages because of cats and dogs (Morrison 1954).
The ship rat has completely replaced the Pacific rat on those islets of Raroia atoll where it is present (Morrison 1954).
On islands not inhabited by rats, geckos (Gehyra oceanica), are apparently abundant on the tree trunks, but where rats are present they are only found high up on the underside of leaves (Morrison 1954).

Invasive species in the Pacific

Taenga, Tepotu, and Tureia Pacific rat (R.H. Taylor, letter 1982).
Tikehau Inhabited. Cat, Pacific rat, Norway rat (Intes and Caillart 1994).
“Some domestic cats returned to the wild were seen wandering in coconut plantations and marshes” (Intes and Caillart 1994: 10).
Opportunities for island restoration “Most of the atolls are poorly known but it is apparent that, until recently at least, some such as MatureiVavao, Marutea-Sud, and Niau have been free of cats and European rats. However, this is mostly assumption based on the continued survival of the kingfisher and/or the Tuamotu sandpiper on those islands” (Dr. R. Hay, pers. comm. 1999).

Tuvalu Islands (Ellice Is) (UK)
(Nine islands in group)
“Mendana possibly sighted the group in 1568. Captain de Peyster in the Rebecca is believed to be the first European to visit the largest atoll, Funafuti, … [in] 1819” (Rodgers 1985). In 1896 Funafuti became the centre of world attention because it was selected as a site on which to sink a deep bore, “in order to test Darwin's theory concerning the formation of coral islands” (Rodgers 1985). Total area: 28.5 km2 (11 sq. mi.). All inhabited by Polynesian population. Population suffered from ‘blackbirding’ [slave trading] in 1850–1875 with severe reduction in numbers (Douglas 1969).
Significant invasive land vertebrates ?Pig, cat, Pacific rat (all islands in group), Norway rat, ship rat (Smith 1969) (J.M. Williams, letter 1982). Mouse. (Formerly cattle, and mongoose.)
“…no assessment of the effect of the remarkable herd of cattle on Niulakita appears to have ever been made; the last of which was killed and eaten but a short time ago” (Rodgers 1985).
“In Tuvalu only three of the nine islands have Rattus rattus, Funafuti, Nanumea and Nukulaelae. The first two were colonised during World War II and the latter in 1922.... As in Kiribati all Tuvaluan atolls are occupied by R. exulans but the densities vary greatly on the different islets around atolls and between atolls. Rainfall and the nature of the substrate and ground vegetation under palms have a major effect” (J.M. Williams, letter 1982).

Only 3 islands in the group have the ship rat – Funafuti, Nanumea, and Nukulaelae. “The first two were colonised during World War II [1940–45]…” (J.M. Williams, letter 1982).
Funafuti Admin. centre for Ellice group was/is? Vaiaku on Funafuti. 2.8 km2 (1.1 sq. mi.). Atoll with 30 islets, central swamp. ?Dog, cat, Pacific rat, Norway rat (introduced 18501896), ship rat (introduced 1940-1945) (J.M. Williams, letter 1982, Smith 1968). Mouse (Hedley 1896).
Dogs at one time were domesticated, but were exterminated by orders of the ‘Turimen’, who used to march round the villages at night to see that everything was all right, but the barking of the dogs gave them away (Hedley 1896).
“Before the advent of Europeans and the introduction of the cat, the natives were much plagued by swarms of the Pacific rat. From time to time when the pest grew beyond endurance, it was the custom for the king to order everyone to bring in a set number e.g. 100 rats” (Hedley 1896).
“Cats have long been introduced … and have proved of service in destroying the brown rat [probably the Norway rat] formerly a great pest to the islands. The European rat [probably the ship rat] and mouse have effected an uninvited entrance to the village and have multiplied fast” (Hedley 1896).
Nanumea 3.9 km2 (1.5 sq. mi.). Atoll with 2 islets. Pacific rat, ship rat (introduced 1940–45) (J.M. Williams, letter 1982).
Nukulaelae 1.8 km2 (0.7 sq. mi.). Atoll with 14 islets on enclosed lagoon. Pacific rat, ship rat (introduced 1922) (J.M. Williams, letter 1982).
The ship rat “colonized Nukulaelae Island in the Ellice group following a 1922 ship wreck” (J.M. Williams, letter 1982). Also of interest is that mongooses were introduced about 1950 (from Fiji) in an attempt to control rats, but they died out.

Sparrman (1953) observed “The only quadrupeds they have are a few hogs and a number of troublesome rats, against which they have to dig deep ditches round their sugar plantations”.
No dogs in pre-European times (Heyerdahl 1952).
“Rattus rattus has not been recorded on Erromanga, currently the least densely populated by men of the six islands. Elsewhere it has been taken principally in plantations or gardens, habitats in which this rat abounds on other Pacific islands … R. norvegicus and Mus musculus are more sporadic in distribution in the New Hebrides, but equally restricted to areas of human habitation or disturbance … The occurrence of R. norvegicus at the high, isolated settlement of Nokovula (1100 m) on Santo was unexpected. The rat most frequently taken in our traps was R. exulans. It was the only rat occurring on all islands sampled, and the only rat found in all habitats, including urban housing (British compound, Luganville), gardens, plantations, secondary bush, natural sea-shore vegetation (at Ipotak, Erromanga) and climax forest far from native settlement (for instance, the kauri forest at Nuangkau, Erromanga)” (Medway and Marshall 1975).
“The pig … was probably brought to the islands by the natives when first they came to them. They are mentioned by Captain Cook … In addition to the domesticated ones, many are feral. In certain of the islands, notably Espiritu Santo and Gaua, quite a large proportion of the domesticated pigs (and of the wild ones also, according to native report) are intersexual, having external organs varying from almost the female to nearly the male condition, and more or less ill-developed male internal organs. They constitute a new type of mamalian intersexuality … Nowhere in the world is any mammalian intersex so abundant. …. These monstrosities play a large part in the social life of the natives, being of especial importance in chief-making ceremonies …” (Baker 1929).

Atoll with three islets, connected by bridges. No original vegetation remaining. Scrub (see Douglas 1969 for details). Devastated by military use and civilian occupation. Airstrip/airport terminal still used (in 1969) by Federal Aviation Agency, for stopover and refuelling.

Cat, Pacific rat, ship rat (introduced 1923–1951, King 1973). Brown tree snake? – has reached Wake, but unclear whether it has established.
“The three islets of this atoll are connected by bridges. Feral cats, black and Polynesian rats occur on all three islets. An endemic rail (Rallus wakensis) became extinct during World War II. There are eight breeding seabird species; seven more bred in the recent past but have been extirpated (King 1973: 101). Bryan (1942) states that the rail, which was more-orless flightless, and stood eight or nine inches high, “was the only native land bird, and was by far the most interesting species”. “Rats prey heavily on Sooty Terns” (King 1973: 101).
The ship rat was introduced to Wake “during the Japanese occupation” in WWII (Dec 1941–Sept 1945) … “with devastating effects on birdlife (Fosberg 1959, in Spennemann 1997: 8).
Several sources describe an explosion of rats: “…soon the Americans were driven near to madness by the countless hordes of rats”, writes an anonymous source in 1941, describing how rat-catchers poisoned the rats, hermit crabs ate the rats and died, then seabirds ate the crabs and died.
“Following the establishment of the Pan American Airways station on Wake and the creation of open rubbish tips, Polynesian rats were to become a plague of major proportions and eventually were the focus of several eradication campaigns” (Spennemann 1997: 5).

“Following Typhoon Sarah on 15 September 1967 rat populations exploded. ‘All fresh eggs disappeared within 24 hours and on two occasions I actually saw rats dragging eggs away while the adult bird stood “helplessly” watching. We watched several rats chewing on young birds’…” (R. Schreiber, Pacific Ocean Biological Survey Program unpublished fieldnotes, in King 1973: 101).

4. Discussion
4.1 Human impact
The impact of introduced plants and animals on island ecosystems in the Pacific has been enormous. Why is it that the native plants and animals, particularly birds, of isolated islands appear to be more vulnerable to introduced mammals than is the case with native plants and animals of continents? The evidence available suggests that it is because island plants and animals have evolved in environments where, apart from bats, land mammals have never been present. Thus island birds have not developed behaviours which give them some protection against mammalian predators, although they may be able to evade bird predators such as hawks and owls. In a parallel manner, the plants of isolated islands have not developed mechanical deterrents, such as spines, or chemical deterrents in their leaves, that would protect them against mammalian herbivores.
However, when considering how much has been lost through our introductions of alien plants and animals, we must also acknowledge the more direct impacts of humans: overkill by hunting; burning and logging of native vegetation and other habitat destruction; and our widespread use of many substances that have polluted air, water and soils.
The impact of humans and their introduced animals and plants on islands goes back many centuries and sometimes thousands of years. Whenever fossil deposits extending into pre-human times are uncovered on an island, we find that a number of interesting animals formerly present (particularly birds) have disappeared since humans arrived. These losses were never described in writing at the time. But this is also frequently the case with losses of fauna and other changes that followed European contact. It is now often difficult to determine whether a particular native species disappeared as a direct result of human action (for example, the introduction of guns for hunting) or whether it was an effect of newly introduced animals, such as rats or pigs.
Notwithstanding the urge that many of us have to get rid of these invasive species, it is not realistic to think that everyone will share this view. Animals such as pigs will always be valued for food; others such as mongooses may still be seen as useful for rat control even though it is very doubtful that such ‘control’ is effective. Still others will be valued for ethical or religious reasons. Thus, in considering and planning control or eradication for a particular introduced animal, it is necessary to understand these various views and accommodate them in any plan that is produced.

4.2 Information gaps
As can be seen from this report, we know the general distribution of introduced mammals and birds across island groups, and we know something of the risks they pose to native plants and animals. Within an island group, however, there is often very little available information on the distribution of these mammals and birds. There is need for trained observers to visit each island within a group, beginning with islands greater than 5 hectares in area, to ascertain which introductions of mammals and birds have already happened.
A good example of this basic inventory work is the study by Buden (1996) of the introduced reptiles, birds, and mammals present on Ant Atoll in the Caroline Islands. Such work lays the basis for more comprehensive studies of whole island groups, of which the work in Fiji by Pernetta and Watling (1978) is an excellent example.
Knowing which introduced animals are present on each island is a necessary starting point. Sometimes, however, it is possible to go beyond this point and document the historical sequence in which each invader arrived, as, for example, in the study of Tinian Island, Mariana group, by Wiles et al. (1990). The great value of having such a chronology is that it may provide clearer insights into the causes of particular impacts as well as revealing information about interactions between different species of invasive animal. In passing, it should be mentioned that Wiles et al. (1990) make a useful distinction between “domestic” and “free-ranging” individuals of an invading species. Dogs and pigs, for example, can quickly change from domestic to free-ranging behaviour, to the detriment of wildlife, without necessarily establishing feral populations. One or two individual animals can have effects out of all proportion to their numbers (as, for example, the loss of kiwi to a single dog in New Zealand—see Section 2.4 on ‘Dog’).
There are areas on some islands where legal protection is given to safeguard habitats or threatened species. These need to be inventoried with respect to their legal status/ownership and the conservation values they are intended to protect. Ideally, whole island groups need to be inventoried in this way so that remaining candidates for protection can be identified.
A third major information gap is that of identifying areas of remaining habitat (with legal status), that, with some management, are likely to be suitable for protecting threatened species, be they plants or animals. “Suitability”, of course, may be dependent on

71

Invasive species in the Pacific

the removal of certain introduced animals and this raises the question of which animals need to be controlled or eradicated if the habitat in question is to provide effective protection for particular threatened species.
4.3 Research needs
Most studies of the impact of invasive animals on native plants and animals have been made in countries outside the area considered here. In spite of this, there is quite sufficient information available from islands both inside and outside the SPREP region to demonstrate how damaging some of these animals can be. All three of the rat species discussed are detrimental to wildlife although little is known about their impact on seeds and seedlings of native trees in the Pacific. Nor is there any doubt about the serious impact that cats (domestic and wild), mongooses and brown tree snakes will have on the wildlife of any island they reach. Most of the information relating to the detrimental effects of pigs in the Pacific comes from Hawai‘i. Some further studies are needed on islands in the SPREP region as a basis for making island people more aware of the need for effective containment of these animals. There is also a need for more data on the incidence of domestic and wild dogs in native forests and the impact they may be having on native wildlife on islands of the region. Little appears to be known of the impact cane toads have on native animals. Two small animals where there appears to be no information from South Pacific islands are the house mouse and the musk shrew. So far as browsing animals are concerned, it is clear that goats, rabbits, and cattle, where they are present, are all extremely damaging both to plants and the structure of habitats.
The value of analytical studies of the impacts of particular invasive species cannot be over-estimated. A good example is the analysis of factors potentially responsible for the decline of the Guam bird fauna (Savidge 1987, Savidge et al. 1992), which clearly identified brown tree snakes as the primary factor. But every invasive animal that reaches an island, in addition to its primary impact, also exerts secondary effects, sometimes referred to as “indirect effects” or “flow-on effects”. McCoid’s (1991) discussion of the secondary effects of brown tree snakes in Guam. though preliminary in nature, underlines the need to understand much more about these effects if we are to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of invasive species.
We presently have very little idea of what the current impact of birds introduced to Pacific islands may be.

Possible ways in which impacts can occur have been discussed under “Introduced birds” (Section 2.15). Behavioural studies of both species of myna, and bulbuls, are needed in habitats where they are likely to interact with native birds. Questions relating to their feeding, nesting and aggressive behaviour need to be answered, from which it should be possible to determine whether these birds pose any significant threat to the breeding success of native birds.
Additional questions remain. What are the effects of jungle fowl on ground-feeding birds and reptiles through food competition? Many other introduced birds appear to feed mainly in agricultural crops, but as with introduced mammals, more information is needed on the total range of foods taken by each of these birds as well as effects that may follow.
Deciding priorities for control of different invasive mammals requires knowledge of their impacts. This is not easy because the most obvious effects are not always the most serious. Furthermore, if stomach analyses are used to determine what a particular predator is eating, a low incidence of a threatened species in the stomach contents of a predator does not mean there is no problem. If the threatened species is rare, it is unlikely to contribute a large part of the predator’s diet; and any predation can be critical if the threatened species is already reduced to low numbers. Decisions on control priorities should be based on the maximum amount of impact information that can be gathered. In this connection, any archaeological or palaeo-ecological studies that are likely to extend our understanding of past impacts of humans and their introduced animals should be encouraged and supported in every way possible.
With respect to the question of how to maintain relatively unmodified islands free of invasive mammals, it is necessary to measure the distances that animals such as rats, mongooses, tree snakes or cane toads can swim. Data relating to the distances that rats may swim is given by Jackson and Strecker (1962) and Spennemann and Rapp (1989). More extensive trials, involving a wider range of sea conditions and all three rat species, are needed.
4.4 Priorities for control or eradication of invasive vertebrates
As indicated above, decisions on control priorities must be based on knowledge of the impacts of invasive species present. A starting point is to identify exactly what is at risk. Is it a particular native plant or animal species, a group of these species, or perhaps a whole community of plants and animals? Can it be demonstrated that introduced mammals are

72

Atkinson and Atkinson: Land vertebrates as invasive species

mainly responsible for the problem or are other factors involved such as overhunting, fires or other kinds of habitat disturbance?
If it is clear that introduced animals are the major factor, then which species is having the greatest effect? An invasive species can have a major impact on one island and be unimportant on another. Such differences can even be found on the same island. Pigs, for example, may be having a relatively minor effect on either the plants or the landbirds present in an area of forest. But in another part of the island, where there is a seabird colony, predation of the seabirds by pigs may be taking the colony to extinction. In other instances, a predator may learn to take a certain kind of prey in one part of an island but not in another. This appears to be the case in the example of ship rats preying on the eggs of the Bonin petrels on Midway Atoll (Grant et al. 1981). Furthermore, the impact of an introduced animal can be modified by the combination of other introduced animals present.
Programmes for control or eradication of any invasive species are likely to be expensive. They must be justified in terms of the expected conservation gain. Thus it must be clear that the animal to be controlled or eradicated is indeed placing particular conservation values at risk.
Eradication of some species of invasive mammal is often feasible on smaller islands even if presently impractical on large islands. Parkes (1990) has identified four conditions that must be met for a successful eradication. All individuals of the animal to be eradicated must be put at risk; there must be no chance of recolonisation from another source; the rate at which the animals are killed must exceed the rate at which the population is increasing; and those attempting the task must believe it is possible. He also concluded that short intensive campaigns concentrating on one pest animal are the most effective, and that eradication campaigns must be funded separately from those requiring sustained control. If the target animal is to be killed faster than it can replace itself, sufficient money must be available to fund the campaign on a scale that will achieve this end.
These requirements for success in eradication programmes raise the question of how to judge whether a proposed eradication attempt is possible. Managers should always attempt to measure the effort, costs and results of either eradication or control programmes so that their experience can be combined with that from programmes elsewhere and thus more

reliable judgements reached. It should always be remembered that every eradication programme provides an opportunity to measure recovery of native plants and animals and thus better understand the impact of the animal eradicated.
Details of successful eradications of animals from New Zealand islands up to 1990 are given by Veitch and Bell (1990).
4.5 Preventing the further spread of invasive animals to islands in the SPREP region
Many island groups already have all the widespread problem mammals characteristic of Pacific islands: cattle, goats, pigs, cats, dogs, three species of rats and mice. But this is not the case on many individual islands within a group. It is essential to prevent the further spread of invasive animals within an island group as well as between groups. Islands of particularly high conservation value should be identified and, wherever possible, given extra protection. Any island that is completely free of invasive mammals should be given the highest priority for protection.
Preventing this spread depends partly on identifying the pathways by which invasive animals are most likely to reach an island. Cattle, goats, pigs, rabbits, cats, dogs and mongooses are purposely, rather than accidentally, taken to islands in boats or aircraft. Thus a checking and quarantine system, vigilantly applied at all times, could be expected to largely prevent the further spread of many of these animals to islands they have not so far reached. But such a system would not prevent further spread altogether. There is an essential educational task of explaining the environmental costs of releasing any of these animals on to islands where they are not already present.
Unless special precautions are taken, the remaining invasive animals are liable to be spread accidentally to additional islands in food supplies, building materials or other cargoes carried by boats or aircraft. These animals are rats, mice and shrews, and brown tree snakes. The boats can vary in size from large ocean-going ships to small ‘run-abouts’, but the greatest risk from invasive animals carried by boats is at the time the vessel is tied to a wharf or on a slipway, or is anchored close inshore. Construction of wharves capable of holding ocean-going ships is an almost certain pathway by which Rattus rattus and R. norvegicus can colonise a previously uninfested island. Atkinson (1977) gives examples of this in Hawai‘i, and Spennemann (1997) demonstrates the same pathway on the atolls of the Marshall Islands.

73

Invasive species in the Pacific

Regular quarantine searches are already made for tree snakes at airports receiving direct flights from Guam where the snake is established. Any island within the SPREP region whose airport is visited by civil or military aircraft that have passed through Guam, and possibly those countries to which the snake is native (Australia, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands), is vulnerable to invasion. Improved control of tree snakes at airports on source islands will reduce this risk. The use of dogs trained to detect snakes at airports receiving flights from Guam, or other islands with snakes, will further reduce the risk.
Precautions against rats and mice, which are applicable also to shrews, are identified and listed by Moors et al. (1992). These precautions include establishing a legal basis for excluding rodents from islands, preparing rodent contingency plans and destruction kits for dealing with invasives, rat-proofing all boxes and crates destined for rodent-vulnerable islands, packing cargoes and stores in rodent-proof containers, re-checking cargo and stores for rodent sign during unloading, and placing permanent rodent-poison stations on wharves and within a radius of about 200 m of the wharf. Poison-bait stations should also be carried by boats moving between rodent-infested and rodent-free islands.
Islands at highest risk to rodents are those importing bulk foodstuffs for humans or stock, or building supplies that are not packaged in rodent-proof containers. Nevertheless, the contents of any container imported to an island cannot be assumed to be free of rodents, shrews or injurious reptiles and insects, if precautions were not taken to exclude such animals during the loading of the container.
We must be aware at all times of the possibility that other species of rodent, snake or unrelated vertebrate, with no previous track record of negative impact, will become established with serious consequences for island plants and animals. Thus a protective strategy is needed for each island group. Such a strategy should include:
(i) a list of the most likely invaders from other island groups or from continents, particularly those that pose risks to health, commercial crops, or conservation values;
(ii) measures for preventing these potential invaders from establishing; these should include agreements with other countries concerning the importation of goods;
(iii) means for the early detection of these potential invaders;

(iv) contingency plans for the rapid elimination of these potential invaders before they have time to establish (Atkinson 1996).
Everybody knows of occasions when warnings about the need to protect certain conservation values have been passed unnoticed if not ignored. There must be a continuing effort by SPREP to assess these warnings for validity and urgency, incorporate them in protection plans when appropriate, and make people generally more aware of measures necessary to protect conservation values.
4.6 Island restoration
Protection is always essential to achieve conservation goals. But many island ecosystems are so seriously damaged, with respect to the condition of native habitats and losses of animal or plant species, that effective conservation cannot be achieved by protecting what is left. Increasingly, there is a need for island restoration programmes in which at least the most aggressive invasive species have to be removed. This paves the way for re-planting programmes in circumstances where natural regeneration is unlikely to repair the damage at a sufficiently fast rate. It may also open possibilities for replacing animal (or plant) species that were formerly present, as well as reinstating some physical conditions of an earlier period, e.g. water-table regimes. The aim of this kind of historical/ecological restoration is to rebuild a plant/animal community that functions more like it did before modification by humans and their introduced plants and animals.
The first need is to identify and list those islands, or parts of larger islands, where there is already some protection of the native plants and animals and the communities they form. Some islands may be uninhabited and free from all other introduced mammals. Depending on their present condition they may be worth restoring to an earlier condition or they may warrant only continuing protection. Opportunities for restoration vary greatly between island groups.
There are several island groups with large numbers of islands. These include Fiji, Caroline Is, Cook Is, Mariana Is, Marshall Is, New Caledonia, New Guinea, Solomon Is, Tonga, Tuamotu Is, and Vanuatu. A search for islands suitable as restoration sites should be undertaken within each of these island groups.
There are a number of islands scattered through the Pacific that should be assessed as possible candidates for programmes of active restoration. Baker and Howland Islands are recognised for their large seabird colonies. Both islands have been troubled by cats in

74

Atkinson and Atkinson: Land vertebrates as invasive species

the past. It is unclear whether these have been eliminated on Baker but they are still present on Howland (King 1973, Rauzon 1986). In the Cook Islands, Suwarrow Atoll is considered to be of great interest scientifically (Douglas 1969), and on Mangaia, Merlin (1991) stated that the plant life on the elevated coral is “still largely dominated by native species.” In the Line Island group, Caroline Atoll (Kepler et al. 1994), and Jarvis and Vostok Islands (King 1973) have all been identified as outstanding for seabird or terrestrial habitat reasons. Permanent protection for Caroline, Vostok and Flint Islands was being negotiated in 1994 (Kepler and Kepler 1994).
In the Mariana Islands some of the uninhabited islands have been protected since 1985 and these may be candidates for restoration (Anon. 1985). In the Marquesas group, the island of Hatutaa appears to be largely unmodified and could be used as a model for restoring the neighbouring Eiao Island, severely damaged by sheep and pigs (Decker 1975). In the Palau group, the Ngerukewid Islands have been identified as of special conservation interest (Wiles and Conry 1990). In the Phoenix group, Bernie Island was described by King (1973) as “nearly in an undisturbed state”, and Enderbury Island is the site of an important green turtle colony.
There are three uninhabited islands in the Pitcairn group (Henderson, Ducie and Oeno). The Pacific rat is present on all three but there is potential for some restoration if this rat can be eradicated on any one of these islands (Steadman and Olsen 1985, Vickery 1994).
In Samoa, the Aleipata Islands are considered to be substantially undisturbed although they may have R. exulans (A. Whistler, letter, 1984). Rose Atoll (American Samoa), where R. exulans is present, is another island that may have restoration potential (King 1973). In the Society Islands, Mohotani is a possible candidate for restoration (Seitre and Seitre 1992: 221), and the same appears to be the case for Rangiroa in the Tuamotu group (R. Hay, pers. comm. 1999). Alofi Island, unlike the neighbouring Wallis and Futuna Islands, seems not to be permanently inhabited and may therefore be worthy of assessment for restoration.
In the south-western Pacific, Rennell and Bellona Islands, Solomon group, have long been recognised as of very high conservation value (see Hamlin 1931 in Greenway 1967, Wolff 1969).
The islands discussed above as possible candidates for restoration have been listed on the basis of very scanty information, much of which is historical and

consequently may be seriously dated. Restorative management is not necessarily always expensive but each proposal must be weighed against the conservation benefits expected. Selecting the most appropriate islands for restorative action in each island group must be based on knowledge of all the options available in each group.
The potential value to restoration projects of longdistance translocations of bird species, that have been lost from one island but survive on another, has been pointed out by Atkinson (1989). Strategies are needed that will disperse populations of vulnerable species to a greater number of islands. Long-distance translocation is also a means of restoring lost components of island ecosystems. Archaeological work by Steadman and Olson (1985), for example, revealed that Henderson Island, Pitcairn group, formerly had a species of large pigeon. This was closely allied to the ‘Marquesas’ pigeon (Ducula galeata), which now survives only on Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas Islands, 2000 km northwest of Henderson Island. It may be that Henderson is a suitable site for the translocation of the endangered Marquesas pigeon.
Franklin and Steadman (1991) provide a detailed methodology, involving habitat mapping, to facilitate such translocations on mainland America, which may have applicability to the Pacific
5. Recommendations
These recommendations have been written in response to the needs of SPREP member countries and territories, but apply to other islands in the Pacific. We recommend that:
1. All island governments should interact and establish an effective strategy to protect islands within their jurisdiction from further entry and establishment of invasive animals. This responsibility of governments needs to be taken up for reasons of economic interest (risks to commercial crops, human health, etc.) and conservation interest. The necessary steps in an effective protection strategy for each island group are: (i) listing likely invaders that can be expected; (ii) developing means for preventing these potential invaders from establishing, including appropriate import agreements with other countries; (iii) developing methods of early detection for each of these invaders by setting up a reporting system with a wide range of cooperators: commercial companies, con-

servation authorities, local NGOs and private individuals (see Westbrooks 1998);
(iv) developing plans for eliminating these invaders before they have time to establish (Atkinson 1996).
2. All reserves where legal protection is given to safeguard habitats or particular species should be listed, together with their legal status/ownership and the conservation values they are intended to protect. Island groups where the existing reserves do not include the range of habitats and native species present in the group should be identified.
3. Systematic surveys of all islands (beginning with those greater than 5 hectares in area) should be made in each island group to find out which introduced mammals and other vertebrate species are present, where this information is not adequately known.
4. A formal system of reserves in the SPREP region should be established that initially recognises three categories:
(i) islands free of all introduced mammals,
(ii) islands free of major mammalian predators (i.e. rats, cats, dogs, pigs and mongooses) that are of a size where it is feasible to eradicate all mammalian herbivores,
(iii) other reserves of conservation value.
Categories (i) and (ii) deserve special protective measures.
5. Islands or island reserves should be identified where control or removal of particular introduced animals is likely to give effective protection to particular kinds of habitat or threatened species.
6. When planning for control or eradication of introduced animals, both specific threats to conservation values and other values that may be attached to the introduced animals should be considered.
7. In each island group, islands should be identified, whether formally reserved or not, where there is real potential for restoring wildlife and vegetation to a condition more like that of earlier times.
8. Further scientific studies should be encouraged, of the ecological impacts of dogs (wild and domestic), mice, musk shrews and cane toads on the native faunas of islands.
76

9. Behavioural studies of interactions between introduced birds and native plants and animals (vertebrate and invertebrate) should be encouraged and supported.
10. Archaeological and palaeo-ecological studies that are likely to increase our understanding of the impact of humans and their introduced animals should be encouraged and supported.
11. Comprehensive tests should be made to ascertain the distances to which rats, mongooses, tree snakes, cane toads, and pigs can swim.
12. Additional specific research needs identified in this study include:
(i) historical studies to ascertain the sequence and approximate dates of establishment of each invasive animal on a particular island;
(ii) analysis of secondary effects of invasive species so that more comprehensive understanding of their impacts is achieved;
(iii) impact studies of animals such as macaque monkeys and monitor lizards, introduced to Pacific islands, even though they may not at present be seen as serious invasive species.

Meyer: Invasive plants in Pacific islands
Preliminary review of the invasive plants in the Pacific islands (SPREP Member Countries)

Jean-Yves Meyer Délégation à la Recherche, BP 20981 Papeete, Tahiti, French Polynesia

Abstract
This report lists and characterises more than 30 alien invasive plant species that are considered by local and academic experts to have become serious threats to the native habitats of the Pacific islands. SPREP member countries except for those considered to be continents or large continental islands and those for which too little information was available have been reviewed. Among the most significant invasive taxa found in most of these islands are the trees Adenanthera pavonina, Leucaena leucocephala, Psidium spp. (P. cattleianum and P. guajava), Spathodea campanulata and Syzygium spp. (mainly S. cumini and S. jambos); the thorny shrubs Lantana camara, Mimosa invisa, and Rubus spp. (mainly R. moluccanus and R. rosifolius); the ornamental shrubs Clerodendrum spp. and erect herbs Hedychium spp.; the climbing vines Merremia peltata, Mikania micrantha, and Passiflora spp.; the grasses Panicum spp. (P. maximum and P. repens), Paspalum spp. (especially P. conjugatum), and Pennisetum spp. (mainly P. polystachyon and P. purpureum); the creeping herb Wedelia (Sphagneticola) trilobata; and the aquatic plant Eichhornia crassipes. Special attention is given to alien plant species which are able to penetrate montane rainforests in several islands, such as the shrubs Clidemia hirta and Cestrum spp., and to very aggressive species found only in one or a few islands and which have not been introduced to the other Pacific islands yet. These include Castilloa elastica in the Samoas, Cordia alliodora in Vanuatu, Miconia calvescens in French Polynesia and Hawaii, Myrica faya in Hawaii, Piper aduncum in Fiji, and Timonius timon in Palau. Among the 30 and more potential invasive plants in the Pacific islands, sometimes locally naturalised but not widespread yet, are Cryptostegia grandiflora, Chrysobalanus icaco, Cinchona pubescens, Cinnamomum spp., Ligustrum spp., Solanum mauritianum, and Thunbergia grandiflora, which are known to be serious invaders in other islands (Galapagos, Mascarenes, Mayotte, New Zealand, St Helena, Seychelles) or tropical countries (Australia, Florida, South Africa, Singapore).

Foreword
With 22 SPREP member countries formed by several hundreds of islands, scattered on the largest ocean on Earth, grouped in three different ethnological and biogeographical regions (Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia), conducting this review was not an easy task. The difficulty of a plant-related review in the Pacific Islands is enhanced by the extraordinary diversity of types of island or group of islands (see e.g. Nunn 1994; Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg 1998): some are oceanic, others are semi-continental or continental; some are disposed in linear groups, others are clustered, or isolated; some are atolls and low limestone islands, other are raised atolls (elevated limestone islands, or makatea islands), or high volcanic islands with rugged relief and great heterogeneity of ecological conditions. Indeed, it is scientifically accepted that invasion processes and successes are not only related to the life-history traits of the invader (“its agressiveness”) but also to the nature of the invaded habitat, including its native biota (“its susceptibility to invasion”).
1. Introduction
This review is the first compiling botanical and ecological data on the current invasive plant species in the Pacific islands (SPREP member countries). The data presented here are based on existing published literature, on recent personal communications of local and academic experts, and on personal observations conducted during the last few years in some Pacific islands during field trips (especially on French Polynesia, Hawaii, Cook Islands, Pohnpei, and Fiji). Numerous reviews have been conducted on weeds in the Pacific islands (see e.g. Whistler 1983, 1995; Waterhouse 1997; Swarbrick 1997), but none of them deals with invasive plants in natural ecosystems. Although lists of invasive plants in some Pacific islands or groups of islands have been drawn up in past or present research and management studies (e.g. Stone et al. 1992 in Hawaii; Meyer 1998 in French Polynesia; Space and Falanruw 1999 in Micronesia; Owen 1997 in New Zealand), the knowledge of invasive plants in the great majority of the other islands in the region is sparse if not completely non-existent. Thus, the main aim of this review was to set up preliminary lists of the dominant, moderate and potential plant invaders in the Pacific islands supplemented by available botanical and ecological data. The voluntary col-

laboration of local and/or academic experts consulted for this review was essential, as it was not possible to visit each island country in the time available. Although most of these experts are not invasive plant specialists, taxonomists or botanists but rather ethnobotanists, biogeographers, foresters, conservationists or naturalists with good field experience, their contribution was highly valuable. The lists presented here are of course not exhaustive nor definitive. They may serve as a technical information document and an indispensable working tool for further research studies and management plans in Pacific island countries.
1.1 Definitions
This review deals with invasive plants (or plant invaders), as defined by the five following criteria in the scientific literature (see e.g. McDonald et al. 1989; Cronk and Fuller 1995; Pysek 1995): (1) they are alien (or non-native, or non-indigenous, or exotic) species; (2) introduced intentionally or accidentally, usually by humans (sometimes by wind, water, birds, mammals) in an area where they have never occurred (or evolved) before; (3) naturalised (or established) in that area, which means that they are able to reproduce sexually or vegetatively without human assistance (or capable to build self-sustaining populations); (4) they are expanding their distribution and/or increasing their abundance; (5) they are occurring in natural (or native, or primary, or undisturbed) and semi-natural habitats (restored habitats and secondary habitats, or partially disturbed areas such as forest trails, gaps and edges); and, last but not least, (6) they are showing significant ecological impacts, often irreversible.
These ecological changes could be on the composition, the structure or the ecosystem processes:
• increased dominance (formation of monotypic stands),
• decreased overall species richness,
• decreased structural diversity,
• decreased spatial heterogeneity,
• competition with native species,
• replacement (or displacement) of native plant and animal species leading to extirpation (loss of one or several populations) or even extinction (loss of all populations),
• change in the ecosystem-level processes: alteration of the water or fire regime, changes in the light quantity and quality, changes in the nutrient cycling pattern, removal of food sources.

1.2 Important remarks
In this review we consider that native (or indigenous) species which show an increase in their distribution and/or their abundance during primary succession or secondary succession (following natural or man-induced disturbances) are not considered as plant invaders but as aggressive colonisers.
Alien species which are not naturalised (most garden ornamental, food plants and tree crops), or which are naturalised but not increasing their distribution and/or abundance (or sub-spontaneous plants such as garden escapes and some cultivated plants) are not considered to be invaders but could be potential (or incipient) invaders if they are known to be invasive in other tropical countries or islands. Indeed, if a plant species has a history of successes in invading specific areas, it is more likely to invade other suitable areas.
Although it is difficult to generalise and make predictions on the invasiveness of a plant species, the following natural history life traits (or biological characteristics) are found in many aggressive invaders:
• rapid growth rate,
• early sexual maturity,
• high reproductive capacity,
• effective dispersal (e.g. fleshy fruits dispersed by frugivorous birds, winged seeds dispersed by wind),
• large soil seed bank,
• long seed persistence in soil,
• tolerance to a wide range of ecological conditions, especially for germination and growth.
A “good invader” can display all these characteristics or only a few of them.
Weeds (or ruderals) which thrive only in disturbed human-made (or unnatural, or human-transformed, or anthropogenic) habitats such as roadsides, dwellings, waste places, village periphery, trails, pastures, agricultural or forested areas, are not included in this review, except when they show a tendency to invade semi-natural and natural habitats. Some invasive plants can also be weeds, and some weeds can invade natural habitats.
Popular terms such as plant pests, noxious plants, harmful plant species are not used in this review, as they can be applied to both weeds and invasive plants.

2. Method
Altogether 16 Pacific islands or groups of islands among the 22 SPREP member countries have been surveyed in this review. Hawaii, a State of the USA, which is one of the four developed nations that are members of SPREP (along with Australia, France, and New Zealand), has been included, as it constitutes an exemplary case for the occurrence and impact of invasive plants in an island ecosystem of the Pacific region.
Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and New Zealand, which are also SPREP members, have not been included, as they are considered as continent or large continental islands. Because of their large size and high biodiversity, they certainly deserve their own treatment.
Because of the lack of available published data and to the impossibility of contacting academic/local experts, the atolls and table reefs of Kiribati (Micronesia), the Marshall Islands (Micronesia), Tokelau (Polynesia), and Tuvalu (Melanesia) have not been considered in this review.
Political boundaries are used in this review rather than the affiliation to the three main biogeographical regions (Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia). The islands are cited by alphabetical order of the country/nation name: Cook Islands (Polynesia), Federated States of Micronesia (Micronesia), Fiji (Melanesia), French Polynesia (Polynesia), Guam (Micronesia), Nauru (Micronesia), New Caledonia (Melanesia), Niue (Polynesia), Northern Mariana Islands (Micronesia), Palau (Micronesia), Pitcairn (Polynesia), Samoas (American Samoa and Samoa) (Polynesia), Tonga (Polynesia), Vanuatu (Melanesia), Wallis and Futuna (Polynesia).
Three categories of invaders have been qualitatively (and subjectively) defined:
• the dominant, D, (or major) invaders are those considered to be the most important threat to biodiversity because they are very widespread and/or they form dense stands, causing severe impacts on native biota;
• the moderate, M, invaders are those considered to be of secondary importance at present, although some of them could become dominant in the future;
• the potential invaders are naturalised alien plants which are not considered as invaders yet, but are known to be highly invasive elsewhere and/or are showing signs of extension (species which are in an early stage of invasion).

Invasive species in the Pacific

Habitat (or vegetation, or plant community) type and elevation range is given when this information is available, as well as some relevant locations (a particular island or archipelago for Pacific countries composed of several islands or several archipelagos, or a specific conservation area).
Habitat description varies according to various authors and to the islands considered (see e.g. Bailey et al. 1991; Dahl 1980; Schmid 1989). The classification system commonly defines vegetation types in terms of physiognomy (structure and stature of the vegetation: grassland v. shrubland v. forest); species composition (emphasising the dominant species, e.g. a Metrosideros forest); topographic position (upland v. lowland, leeward v. windward, volcanic v. calcareous soils); and climatic conditions (dry v. mesic v. wet). In addition, classes can be identified by the degree of human disturbance from completely altered areas to partially disturbed natural vegetation.
The main vegetation units used in this review are based on the most recent book on the vegetation of the Pacific islands by Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg (1998):
• coastal (or strand, or littoral) vegetation,
• mangrove forest, • lowland dry forest,
• inland mesic (or mesophytic, or moist) forest,
• upland wet (or rain) forest, and • montane cloud forest (or mossy forest, or elfin
forest) which can be viewed as biodiversity hotspots and refugia for endemic species.
The cloud forests, in addition to their biodiversity value, are the principal watersheds of Pacific high oceanic islands. For both these reasons, their protection, conservation and active management should be given a very high priority within the Pacific region (Merlin and Juvic 1995). Subalpine and alpine forests, and

montane bogs have not been considered in this review, as they occur above 2500 m elevation and are found only in Hawaii and New Zealand. Fernlands and grasslands are usually found on disturbed dry or mesic slopes (human or natural disturbances).
Habit is defined when needed (aquatic plants are rooted, floating or emergent in aquatic situations – wetlands, lakes and rivers; terrestrial plants are species rooted in soil). Life (or growth) forms are:
• herbs, defined as plants with little or no woody growth; among the herbs, we have distinguished ferns (Pteridophytes) from grasses (Gramineae), and sedges (Cyperaceae) – erect or tall herbs (ferns, grasses, or sedges) are above 1 m in height;
• shrubs are woody plants with several stems, usually shorter than trees;
• trees are woody plants with generally one major trunk; small trees are less than 10 m tall and large trees above 10 m tall; we have also distinguished palms (Palmae) and tree ferns (Cyatheaceae);
• vines are woody or non woody plants which can not stand free by themselves;
• succulents are xerophytic plants with fleshy or succulent stems (Agavaceae, Crassulaceae, Cactaceae).
As the scientific name of a genus or plant species may change, the most common synonym is indicated in brackets. The genus and family names are chosen according to Mabberley (1997). For instance, the botanical genus Palmae is used rather than Arecaceae, Compositae rather than Asteraceae, Leguminosae rather than Fabaceae and Caesalpiniaceae.
The common names are the English names commonly used worldwide (see e.g. Mabberley 1997), rather than local (island) names.
