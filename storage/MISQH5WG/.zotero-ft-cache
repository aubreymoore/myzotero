INTRODUCTION [ edit ]

Guam, being a small, isolated, oceanic island, is susceptible to pest invasions. Guam is the transportation hub for Micronesia with direct shipping links to Asia, Hawaii, North America and Australia. In addition, there are frequent air and ocean freight movements associated with US military bases on Guam. The following emergency response plan (ERP) was developed to provide guidance when invasive species are detected in order to protect Guamâ€™s biodiversity, agriculture, tourism, public health, and social and cultural way of life. The goal of this plan is to have a set of procedures in place to be activated immediately whenever an invasive species is first detected.

This draft ERP was initiated by members of the Guam Invasive Species Advisory Committee during an Emergency Response Planning Workshop sponsored by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) and held on Guam from May 31 to June 2, 2005. Representatives from other jurisdictions in the region also participated in the workshop; participants came from Palau, Pohnpei, Yap, Chuuk, Kosrae and the Marshall Islands with facilitating experts from SPC and New Zealand.

It is recommended that this ERP plan be reviewed periodically by the Guam Invasive Species Advisory Committee. This plan shall also be reviewed after any exotic pest invasion.

This plan derives legislative powers from relevant national and territorial laws and regulations.
DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF THE CAPABILITY TO RESPOND TO INVASIVE SPECIES INCURSIONS [ edit ]
Management Structure [ edit ]

The Governor, on advice from the Guam Invasive Species Council (GISC), plays a leading role in the implementation of the Guam General Emergency Response Plan for Invasive Species.

An Emergency Response Subcommittee (ERS) under the Guam Invasive Species Advisory Committee (GISAC) is formed at the declaration of a response. Membership of this committee is derived from the technical committee members of GISAC based upon the type of invasive species threat.

To facilitate the rapid deployment of field operations, GISAC will identify appropriate persons who could fill the role of Ad hoc Emergency Response Subcommittee and other field team management positions.

At the declaration of an invasive species emergency, Director of Agriculture then appoints the Operations Manager / HQ Controller to implement the Emergency Response Plan (ERP).

Stores/Finance [ edit ]

In an event of outbreak, financial resources must be made available from central government funding. Longer term assistance could be requested from regional organizations and international donor agencies. This financial assistance could include stores and essential consumables.
THE TECHNICAL PROCESS [ edit ]

Figure 2. Flow chart showing the technical process.
Initial Response [ edit ]

Once an invasive species is detected at a site, it should be reported to GISAC. A locally based Technical Specialist visits the site and makes a preliminary diagnosis of the problem, taking appropriate precautionary measures, and collects samples if necessary. If the detection is positive (or not negative), the chair of GISAC is informed immediately. A confirmation of the specialistâ€™s identification may require overseas identification. Funds may be requested for the identification of the specimen overseas.

A delimiting survey, to establish the extent of spread of the pest, as well as some initial controls, may be advised by the Technical Specialist. These controls may include restriction of the movement of risk or host material and the application of chemicals or other treatments to prevent further spread of the problem. Tracing may be required to establish the entry pathway of the pest and to establish whether any further spread has occurred.

The Chair of GISAC convenes an emergency meeting of GISAC to review the situation. If an emergency response is warranted, a chair for an Emergency Response Subcommittee (ERS) is appointed. The situation will be reported to GISC indicating that a response operation is required.

Other departments and stakeholders would be notified accordingly once the ERS has been formed.
Response [ edit ]

The ERS will develop a strategy and present the situation including a cost/benefit analysis to GISC. The response will be activated by the Governor. The Director of Agriculture appoints a field operations team manager according to set procedures. Operations will be conducted according to the advice of the ERS. Field response operations can be divided into the following areas of activity:

    Operations / HQ management
    Logistics / Administration
    Diagnostic / laboratory
    Mapping
    Surveillance / trapping / ground surveys
    Movement control
    Tracing
    Organism management / control / eradication

The results of these operations will indicate whether the exotic pest can be eradicated or not.

Stand-down procedures shall be implemented based on the ERS recommendations.
MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES [ edit ]

(See Figure 1. Management Structure, generic to both animal and plant outbreaks.)
Overview of the management system [ edit ]

The Management structure should be broad based with personnel holding key responsible areas from all authorities and agencies involved in the emergency or outbreak or who can contribute to its resolution. Representatives need to be of sufficient authority to be able to make decisions on behalf of their organization. This team shall be called the Emergency Response Subcommittee (ERS). The ERS will make decisions on what actions to take according to reports received on the outbreak.
Director of Agriculture (Table 1) [ edit ]

Will be responsible for the entire operation.
Chair of Emergency Response Committee [ edit ]

Manage and oversee the program and entire operation (including expenditure).

    Notify other government agencies, non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders on implications of actions taken, such as environmental impacts (chemical usage, slaughter of animals, dumping and burning), human health, social and economic issues.
    Responsible to administer restrictions on the movement of people, machinery, plants or plant products, animals or animal products and the sale of such products according to appropriate legislation. Should liaise with the Attorney Generalâ€™s office, Police and other government agencies if required.

Field Operations Team Manager [ edit ]

The field operations team manager is required to report to the Chair of ERS and provide information to the ERS on the progress of the program.
Mapping Group and GIS [ edit ]

The Department of Agriculture, with the assistance of other relevant agencies, will provide the maps required for the emergency response program. Geographical information system (GIS) software, available in the Department would be a useful tool for mapping boundaries and estimating sizes of both the infested areas and of the endangered area. GIS could also be used for enhancing prompt containment of the outbreak.
Logistics and Administration Group [ edit ]

The Department of Agriculture, with the assistance of other appropriate agencies, shall be responsible for the supply of resources and the provision of the budget, which will include the following:

    Human resources
    Salaries and wages
    Overtime payments
    Accommodation for off-island experts
    Hiring of temporary labor
    Transport, including the hire of transport or other equipment to mobilize staff, plant and plant material, animal and animal material
    Fuel and spare parts
    Specialized equipment as required for the response type
    Safety equipment and first aid kits
    Stationary and other consumables
    Compensation - appropriate compensation payments for destroyed crops and animals or any materials affected by the outbreak

All Occupational Safety and Health regulations must be adhered to.
