Abstract. An annotated list of 393 adventive terrestrial arthropod species plus three new varieties of known established species, which have been recorded in Hawaii since the Fourth Edition of Bishop Museum’s Hawaiian Terrestrial Arthropod Checklist (Nishida 2002), is presented. This compilation includes records of over 362 nonnative arthropod species published between the years of 2001 and 2017 as well as over 30 new Hawaii State records that have not been previously recorded. Annotations include date first detected, island distribution, citation, relevant biological notes, and for new state and island records, the collection data. A separate table with about 150 entries lists the synonyms, misidentifications, deletions, and changes of status for species included in the 2002 checklist that were discovered during our research. However, the latter list is not comprehensive as a complete revision of the 2002 checklist was beyond the scope of our project. Also included is a bibliography of the approximately 270 source documents that were consulted. We intend for this publication to be a useful supplement to the 2002 edition of the Hawaiian Terrestrial Arthropod Checklist.
Key words: New state records, Hawaii, insects, arthropods, checklist

Since its first edition was published in 1992, the Hawaiian Terrestrial Arthropod Checklist (Nishida 1992) has been an indispensable reference not only for Hawaii’s entomologists but for biologists from all areas of study. The Checklist is an “authority file of non-marine arthropod names for the Hawaiian Islands” and has been the basis for determining the status of both native and adventive arthropod species. While at the Bishop Museum, Nishida updated The Checklist three times: in 1994, 1997, and, finally, in 2002. Since Nishida’s departure from the museum, an update has not been issued in over sixteen years. The realization that invasive species pose many of the greatest threats to Hawaii’s environment, agriculture, native ecosystems, and people justifies the high priority given to maintaining an updated checklist of established alien species in the Hawaiian Archipelago.
Biologists working in numerous fields rely on this checklist and refer to it when making administrative decisions and rules, identifications, or diagnostics, as well as for data entered into reports and publications on invasive species and new arrivals into the Islands. Biosecurity officials refer to this checklist when interceptions are made on both imports and exports. When State Plant Quarantine inspectors intercept arthropod pests coming into Hawaii’s ports, the Checklist is consistently consulted to determine if the species is already established in the state or not known to occur. If the species in question is identified as not known to occur in Hawaii, dispositions of those shipments may include destroying, treating, or refusing entry of the shipment. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) also regularly requests establishment data of arthropod pests in Hawaii to regulate importation of plants

and plant products from Hawaii to the U.S. mainland. The Checklist also assists in the conservation of native Hawaiian arthropod species by providing a quick reference on the status and island distribution of both native and potentially harmful alien species. It also has proven to be a resource for showing where the distribution and information gaps are, which have facilitated surveys and new research initiatives. The inclusive data allows researchers to keep better track of recognized indigenous and endemic species, therefore contributing to the studies of endangered species, conservation, and biodiversity. While the list included herein does not include an update of the native taxa, the listing of alien species can provide insight into the balance of native and adventive groups over time. Corroborating the usefulness of the Checklist was the sudden increase of new records published after the advent of the earlier editions, as researchers discovered that many of the species they were studying had not yet been formally recorded.
In the latest edition (2002), Nishida estimated around 3049 adventive arthropod species were established in the state, which was 286 species more than recorded in the 1997 edition. Since then [the 2002 edition had a listing cutoff date of around 1999 (Kumashiro et al. 2002)], hundreds of additional immigrant arthropod species have been discovered in Hawaii. These new arrivals have been recorded in various peer-reviewed scientific journals, technical reports, and other literature including some in obscure journals. These scattered references are often difficult for researchers and other stakeholders to access. Because these records are scattered, efficiently finding establishment data is often a time-consuming and onerous task. In addition, many new records have not been published

2
for a variety of reasons, such as the following: • Only a few individuals or a single population may have
been collected once and not collected again. In such cases, it may not be possible to identify the species or determine establishment until additional specimens or biological data become available. • The continuing decline in the number and availability of classical taxonomists and specialists able to assist in the identification of newly discovered species in the state, especially when the species is new to science or in groups in need of revision. Thus, many collections may remain unidentified until an appropriate taxonomist is available. • The latter problem is greatly exacerbated since there are more species of arthropods in the world than any other taxonomic group, and arriving alien species can come from anywhere through commerce and actions of people. This often leads to misidentification of specimens, synonymies, or constant confusion of correct taxonomic classification. • Finally, with the significant decline in number of local entomologists, new records may not be discovered and published in a timely matter.
Updating the Hawaiian Terrestrial Arthropod Checklist is an enormous task which can take years, even with someone fully dedicated to the project. In an effort to gather the scattered records of newly established arthropods and to consolidate them into one easily accessible source, a USDA Farm Bill project was undertaken. To distribute our work more widely, the results of this project will be published in two parts: The addition to the 2002 Bishop Museum Arthropod Checklist (included herein) and a pathway analysis of how these immigrants arrived in the Islands.
The goal of this paper is to compile a list (Table 1) of the immigrant non-marine arthropod species that have been discovered since Nishida 2002. We include both published records as well as new records not previously published. The latter include species believed to be established that are known to us and have been authoritatively identified with voucher specimens deposited in an entomological collection. Excluded are new records for indigenous and endemic species. Since the beginning of this project, keeping up with a continuous stream of new records has delayed its publication; therefore, to disseminate the list in a timely manner, most unpublished new state records added to this list were capped at 2015, with a few relevant exceptions. New arrivals identified after this cutoff will be published in a subsequent paper. Known records published by others have been added to the list, up to the date of submission.
The arrangement of taxa follows that used in the previous checklist (Nishida 2002). That is, the taxa are arranged alphabetically within the next higher category, which is also arranged alphabetically. Thus, species are listed alphabetically within their genus, which is alphabetized within its family, and so on.

To make the list more useful, we include citations to the pertinent literature, year of earliest detection in Hawaii, collection data for previously unpublished records, island distribution, and notes on each species. New island records noted in this list refer to new records after the initial new state record listed was published, but do not include new island records of species already listed in Nishida 2002. While every effort was taken to ensure accuracy, some errors inevitably occur in a work of this magnitude. The most up-to-date name and classification scheme is used for the listed species. When applicable, synonyms and previous names are included. However, names change not only from corrections of misidentifications, but also from improvements in our understanding of the taxonomy of a group.
While compiling this list, several synonyms, misidentifications, deletions, and changes in status were discovered, in the noted source documents, for many of the species recorded in Nishida 2002. These emendations, which total about 150 changes, are included in Table 2; however, it was beyond the scope of this project to conduct an exhaustive or complete search of changes since Nishida 2002.
Over 270 source documents were consulted for included establishment records and taxonomic changes. These added published records for approximately 361 species of alien arthropods to the known fauna of Hawaii. In addition, this report adds another 33 new state establishment records that have not been reported previously, which brings the total to approximately 396 species added to the fauna since Nishida 2002 (Table 1). This brings the total number of alien, nonmarine arthropod species reported to occur in Hawaii to over 3,829. However, many of these may have been extirpated and are no longer present, or populations have not established. The collection data and relevant biological notes documenting each new state and island record for these taxa as well as notes on the status changes are provided in the Collection Data and New Record Summaries section.
The information in this article is as accurate as the authors could verify; however, there may be errors or pertinent data which we missed. If any errors are detected, please contact us.

Arachnida: Acari Eriophyidae Aceria guerreronis Keifer NEW STATE RECORD
Although this species was recorded on Maui as far back as 1991, this identification was based on associated host plant damage to coconut fruit. Since then, this eriophyid has reached Oahu in 2002, Molokai in 2014, and Kauai in 2016. A morphological identification was finally provided by E. McDonald in 2016.

Arachnida: Araneae Lycosidae Hogna crispipes (L. Koch) New island record
This species was first listed from Kahului in 2002 as Lycosa sp. A and provisionally considered native (Howarth and Preston 2002); however, the form of the male pedipalp is closer to extra-limital species of Hogna rather than the native Hawaiian wolf spiders. Hogna is the largest genus of wolf spiders with a nearly world-wide distribution. The Maui specimen proved to be the same species as an adventive species found on Kauai and Oahu, which was recently identified by V. Framenau as H. crispipes (L. Koch, 1877). This species is widespread in Australia and many Pacific islands (Framenau et al. 2006).

Insecta: Coleoptera Anthribidae Eucorynus crassicornis (Fabricius) NEW STATE RECORD
An adult weevil emerged from a Chinese imported garlic bulb purchased from an Oahu supermarket in 2010. According to G.A. Samuelson, a single specimen was turned in to him by W.D. Perreira previous to this collection, in 2005. Additional adults have been found at large in homes that had similar Chinese imported garlic bulbs sitting out on countertops. Specimens have also been found at large associated with Pritchardia palms and rotting Cassia. G.A. Samuelson sent one specimen to Barry Valentine to confirm the identification.

Chrysomelidae Trachymela sloanei (Blackburn) NEW STATE RECORD
Trachymela sloanei was first discovered in 2011 on Eucalyptus camaldulensis trees exhibiting peculiar notches along leaf edges, characteristic of caterpillar feeding. A closer inspection of the red gum trees revealed numerous larvae and two adult chrysomelids under the tree bark. Species identification was confirmed by Alexander Konstantinov at USDA-ARS-SEL in December, 2011.
This native to Australia ferociously invaded New Zealand in 1976 (Brockerhoff and Bain 2000), defoliating eucalyptus trees throughout the country. In 1998, it was detected in California, the first record of this species in the U.S. This species is known to be intercepted at Honolulu ports of entry on shipments of cut myrtle. This discovery of T. sloanei in Waimanalo represented the first records of the Australian tortoise beetle in Hawaii. In May 2013, T. sloanei was collected from red gum trees at Kapalua, Maui, a new island record.
Trachymela sloanei adults and larvae are nocturnal, feeding at night on the leaves, and hiding under the tree bark during the day. They sometimes hide high up in the trees and it is common to see the feeding damage but not find the culprits. The adult is 6-7 mm long, entirely brown with darker mottled spots and can be mistaken for a ladybug. Eggs are laid under the bark or on the leaves. T. sloanei is reported to feed on a variety of Eucalyptus species, but in Hawaii it has only been confirmed feeding on E. camaldulensis thus far.

Clambidae Undetermined genus sp. A
Without specific identifications, it is not possible to determine whether the specimens from Kauai and Maui represent one or two species, or whether they are native and therefore not adventive.
Curculionidae Atrichonotus taeniatulus (Berg) NEW STATE RECORD
Several adult weevils were initially dissected from the crop of a deceased black francolin bird in 2009, however, field collected specimens were not found until 2010 when adults were observed infesting Medicago lupulina.

Naupactus leucoloma Boheman The white-fringed weevil, Naupactus leucoloma, was first
detected swarming outside of a homeowner’s porch, near pasture land on the Big Island. This species was reported by Conant (2013), however collection data for this new state record is reported here.
N. leucoloma and Atrichonotus taeniatulus, were both collected in and around North Hawaii island ranchlands and cattle pastures of Waimea and Kohala. These species are well known pests of alfalfa (Medicago sativa, Fabaceae) and other legumes used as cattle graze in pastures. In addition, N. leucoloma is a polyphagous pest of over three-hundred known species of agricultural crops, pastures, ornamentals, and other plant species where they are established [Southern United States, Central and South America, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa (Walker 2006)]. Some hosts recorded in literature include Brassica spp., Glycine max, Citrullus lanatus, Solanum lycopersicum, Ipomoea batatas, and Zea mays. Adult weevils feed on the foliage of hosts, while larvae cause the greatest damage by feeding on roots in the soil (Capinera 2008). Both A. taeniatulus and N. leucoloma have fused elytra and are therefore limited in dispersal capabilities by crawling and human aided hitchhiking.

Scolytogenes sp. A NEW STATE RECORD
Specimens identified by Donald J. Bright as Scolytogenes sp. A were collected from coffee berry borer traps (BROCAP traps with a mixture of 3:1 methanol:ethanol) at two separate coffee farms on Hawaii island.

Scarabaeidae Protaetia orientalis (Gory & Percheron) New island records
While Protaetia orientalis was first discovered on Oahu in 2002, populations have exploded in recent years, making this relatively large beetle (between 2 cm and 2.5 cm) a surprising sight to residents and a consistently reported pest. Adults can be sometimes be seen aggregating in large numbers on overripe fruit and fruit-producing flowers, especially the inflorescence of palm trees, mangoes, and lychee. Although reports from Oahu residents have suggested that these larger groups of feeding beetles can damage flowers and in some cases reduce fruit yield, there have not been any scientific studies to date.

Tenebrionidae Bolitophagini?; Undetermined genus sp. A First field collection, unknown establishment
A single collection of several adult Tenebrionids was made from wet lumber in Hilo. While the lumber was imported, it would have been shipped dry and become moist while sitting on the property, making it difficult to determine if these beetles may have hitched a ride with the shipment or not. The specimens were sent to G.A. Samuelson for identification, however, they were unidentifiable past the tribe level. Samuelson believes a specialist on Tenebrionidae will need to examine these beetles for species identification.

Menephilus arciscelis Marseul NEW STATE RECORD		
Several adults were collected at a Mililani residence over the course of two years. Not much can be found in literature (in English), but this species is known to be native to Japan.

Stethotrypes raffrayi (Thomson) NEW STATE RECORD
Hundreds of tiny dark brown beetles with gold patches were found crawling around wooden nursery benches covered in

6
algae. Adult beetles, larvae, and pupae crowded under and within potted plants, in corners of nursery benches, and under wet rocks and bricks. With the expertise of Dr. Wolfgang Schawaller, an identification was finally determined.
According to Schawaller, Stethotrypes raffrayi is known from Java, Sumatra, and the Philippines. While species in the tribe Leiochrinini are not known to be pests, the high numbers of these beetles not previously known to occur in the U.S. were becoming problematic in some nursery plants exported to the mainland U.S. These tenebrionids are just over 2 mm and resemble coccinellid beetles with their round, dome-like elytra.

Insecta: Diptera Agromyzidae Liriomyza sp. A (apparently undescribed) NEW STATE RECORD
Specimens of this leafminer were reared from blotch mines on the leaves of crown flower (Calotropis gigantea) and tropical milkweed (Asclepias curassavica) planted at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Adults and associated host plant damage appeared to be new to Hawaii and specimens were sent to USDA-ARS-SEL, then referred to Owen Lonsdale at the Canadian National Collection of Insects, Arachnids and Nematodes.
According to O. Lonsdale, this leafminer appears to be an undescribed species of Liriomyza most closely related to L. asclepiadis and L. subasclepiadis. Larvae produce blotch mines on leaves of Calotropis gigantea. Populations of this undescribed Liriomyza sp. appears to be controlled on Oahu by several locally established parasitoids, including Closterocerus utahensis Crawford and Chrysocharis sp. (Eulophidae- larval endoparasitoids) and Digliphus begini (Ashmead) (Eulophidae), a larval ectoparasitoid.

Chironomidae Apedilum elachistus Townes NEW STATE RECORD
Wolff (2002) reported collecting pupae of an unidentified species of Apedilum during a survey of the invertebrates living in streams on Oahu. The adults identified here most likely represent the same species. A. elachistus is widespread in North America. Larvae are blood worms and live in eutrophic sediments in streams and shallow water bodies. When abundant, the swarming adults can become a nuisance.

Culicidae Aedes japonicus (Theobald) New island record
Aedes japonicus has been established on Hawaii island since 2004 (Larish and Savage 2005) and while a single individual was detected in a monitoring trap at Honolulu International Airport, Oahu in 2012 (Yang and Hasty 2013), this mosquito has not been collected from the field on other main islands until 2013 (Magnacca 2015). In addition to Magnacca’s (2015) list of new island establishments on Oahu and Kauai, this single specimen collected at The Nature Conservancy’s Waikamoi Preserve on Haleakala, Maui is evidence of this species’ spread across the Hawaiian Islands.

Anthocoridae Montandoniola confusa Streito & Matocq
The predaceous anthocorid bug, under the name Montandoniola moraguesi (Puton), was introduced into Hawaii from the Philippines in 1964 for the biological control of the Cuban laurel thrips (Gynaikothrips ficorum). According to PluotSigwalt et al. (2009), M. moraguesi had been misidentified for over 45 years. Species in the genus Montandoniola are easily confused, as it is difficult to separate them by external morphology alone. Genitalia dissections are necessary to identify key diagnostic features. Pluot-Sigwalt et al. (2009) examined the genitalia of type specimens from various parts of the world and concluded that three cryptic species have been confused under the species name Montandoniola moraguesi. As a result, Pluot-Sigwalt et al. (2009) determined that M. moraguesi appears restricted to the Mediterranean region and Africa. M. thripodes and M. pictipennis are known from Hong-Kong and Japan, respectively.
Montandoniola confusa Streito & Matocq, described as a new species in Pluot-Sigwalt et al.’s review (2009), was discovered in Guadeloupe, and is found in Florida, Bermuda, Australia (Pluot-Sigwalt et al. 2009), Mexico (Cambero-Campos et al. 2010), Brazil (Tavares et al. 2013), and presumably Philippines where the Hawaiian introduction originated. Historical specimens from Hawaii were examined in this study and determined to be M. confusa and not M. moraguesi.
Prior to the 2009 study there was confusion over another name: Macrotrachelia thripiformis Champion, 1901, which has been used for two different species in Hawaiian literature. Lattin (2005) reviewed the literature and examined specimens from Bishop Museum. He concluded that the name Macrotrachelia thripiformis, listed by Nishida (2002) very likely refers to Montandoniola moraguesi (now M. confusa).
In addition, the 1965 introduction of what was then reported as “Macrotrachelia thripiformis (Davis & Chong 1966)” to Hawaii from Mexico was misidentified. Lattin (2005) identified a series of voucher specimens from the 1965 Mexico population release as Macrotrachelia nigronitens (Stal 1860).

7
No field established collections of M. nigronitens (= M. thripiformis) are known, and this species appears not to have established in Hawaii. However, as noted by Lattin (2005), anthocorids are tiny and easily missed in surveys.
Asterolecaniidae Planchonia stentae (Brain) NEW STATE RECORD
In 2009, stems of Hoya imperialis var. rauchii from Keaau, Hawaii, were found to be infested with pit scales. Specimens were then identified by D.R. Miller as Planchonia stentae (Brain), the South African pit scale. Following this 2009 verification, previously unidentified specimens (Waimea, 2007) were found in HDOA’s reference collection, reexamined, and consequently identified as P. stentae. This species has now been collected on Hawaii, Maui, and Oahu.
This South African pit scale, also known as the Euphorbia pit scale, has been recorded in California and Florida, where it has become a major pest of at least 49 introduced and native plant species (Stumph and Lambdin 2000). This species can severely weaken small and young plants, causing major stem deformation, especially at apical tips.

Cicadellidae Draeculacephala portola Ball NEW STATE RECORD
Draeculacephala portola Ball was reported from Hawaii in 1959 by Young and Davidson (1959), however, according to Napompeth and Nishida (1974) this was in error. In 1992, Christopher H. Dietrich (Formerly USDA-ARS-SEL, now University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign) who published a revision of the genus Draeculacephala, examined Hawaiian specimens. All Hawaii specimens were of D. californica, D. inscripta, and D. minerva, reinforcing the previous misidentification record. The 2012 collection represents a new state record for D. portola.

Coccidae Ceroplastes eugeniae Hall NEW STATE RECORD
D.R. Miller tentatively identified Hawaii specimens as Ceroplastes poss. rusci, but noted that these had more stig-

8
matic setae than typical C. rusci and seemed slightly larger. Slide-mounted specimens were forwarded to Ana Lúcia B. G. Peronti, Universidade Federal de São Carlos, as she worked on the revision of the genus in Brazil. Peronti subsequently provided a firm identification as Ceroplastes eugeniae Hall. Previous notes of Ceroplastes rusci collections should be changed to C. eugeniae.

Pulvinariella mesembryanthemi (Vallot) NEW STATE RECORD
Heavily infested samples of what was called “akulikuli” by the collector, were brought to the attention of UH-CTAHR, and further handed on to HDOA for identification. A tentative identification and further confirmation by G.A. Evans concluded that this was the ice plant scale, Pulvinariella mesembryanthemi (Vallot). After some confusion of the initial plant from which it was collected, it was discovered that the host was actually Lampranthus roseus, mini ice plant, and not one of the native akulikuli species (Sesuvium portulacastrum). Within several months, Maui and Oahu infestations were also detected, suggesting that P. mesembryanthemi has been present in Hawaii for some time. Interestingly, an infestation detected in Kona was found in the Kona International Airport’s landscaping, while the Oahu infestation was also found near the Honolulu International Airport, in the Mapunapuna roadside landscaped areas. It is highly likely that the iceplant scale was spread via nursery stock used for these landscaped areas.
Recorded host plants of the ice plant scale include Carpobrotus spp., Disphyma spp., Mesembryanthemum spp. (Aizoaceae); Atriplex vesicaria and Lampranthus spp. (Chenopodiaceae) (García Morales et al. 2016). In addition, according to Qin and Gullan (1992), S. portulacastrum is a possible host plant in Australia.

Coreidae Acanthocoris sp. A NEW STATE RECORD
According to T.J. Henry, this group is in need of serious revision; adults are not identifiable to species. There are many similar species and no identification keys to separate them. Acanthocoris sp. A represents the second of two alien leaf-footed bugs which feed on Ipomoea spp. to establish in Hawaii. Physomerus grossipes, which has become common on sweet potato, was first detected in 1997.

Cydnidae Fromundus biimpressus (Horváth) NEW STATE RECORD
Thousands of burrowing bugs at a Keaukaha school and surrounding areas on Hawaii island were reported by the public to HDOA in 2015. The burrowing bugs were attracted to the bright lights of the athletic field and gym at night and could be found in masses around the school on sidewalks, along buildings, in the baseball dugouts, and on landscaping in following days. In addition, swarming in masses at various beach parks (Onekahakaha and Richardson’s Beach Park) in the Keaukaha area were also reported around the same week.
It first appeared that this was a new unrecorded species of Cydnidae, however, a review of the HDOA collection found unidentified specimens collected from Oahu in the 1980’s which were identical to the Keaukaha individuals. Shortly after the Keaukaha swarms, a single specimen was submitted from Kauai. Further, a review of a cydnid first reported as “Genus? sp. A” in Howarth and Preston 2002 was also the same species. Specimens were forwarded to USDA-ARS-SEL for identification in 2015 but remained pending. With the assistance of Joe Eger, an identification was provided and confirmed by James N. Zahniser USDA-ARS-SEL after re-submitting additional specimens.
Fromundus biimpressus is known from South East Asia (China, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam). In 2004 it was discovered on Guam under similar circumstances, at lights during the night (Lis and Zack 2010).

Diaspididae Andaspis numerata Brimblecombe NEW STATE RECORD
Stems of a reported dying Hibiscus rosa-sinensis plant initially thought to be weakened by disease, was further examined for the possibility of insect boring damage. Microscopic examination revealed the entire surfaces of the woody stems were covered in layers and layers of armored scales, reaching several millimeters thick. The layers were so thick that it appeared as if the armored scale coverings were the bark of the tree. An additional collection of this scale was found nearby several months later, however, it has not yet been reported outside of the Kapahulu, Honolulu, Oahu area. It can easily go undetected, camouflaged with the bark of woody plant stems.
Andaspis numerata Brimblecombe, identified by D.R. Miller on May 23, 2011, represents both a new Hawaii record and a new U.S. record. According to Miller (2011 pers. comm., 23 May), A. numerata has been intercepted from Samoa in Honolulu in 1931 on (?) Agrostrophyllum rheineckianum (Orchidaceae). It has also been intercepted in San Francisco in 1952 on Hibiscus sp.; and from Fiji at DC in 1956 on Erythrina fusca (Fabaceae) cuttings. A. numerata is distributed throughout Australasia (American Samoa, Australia, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, Western Samoa) and India (García Morales et al. 2016) where it is a serious pest to tea plants (Das 1976).

A single collection of this species was found infesting the fruits of a potted loulu palm plant (Pritchardia sp.) in a Waimanalo nursery in May 2009. Specimens were forwarded to D.R. Miller and identified as Aonideilla orientalis (Newstead), the Oriental scale. Upon subsequent surveys, no other infestations could be found. It is unknown if A. orientalis is established.

Miridae Kundakimuka queenslandica Cassis NEW STATE RECORD
The 2 mm-long predaceous Kundakimuka queenslandica Cassis was discovered while looking for specimens of the leaf-tying moth, Choreutis sp. (Lepidoptera: Choreutidae), on Ficus benjamina and F. retusa. Specimens were found inside of leaves folded by Choreutis sp., and in several cases, a dead, early-instar Choreutis sp. was present. Specimens of K. queenslandica were first collected in May 2002 in Waimanalo, Oahu, however, remained unidentified until an additional collection in 2009. The September 2009 discovery was serendipitous, found while looking for the recent immigrant, Apotomorhinus cribratus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae).
In December 2010, T.J. Henry identified the predator as close to the species Kundakimuka queenslandica Cassis. In January 2011 G. Cassis confirmed this identification. K. queenslandica was described from specimens collected from Australia, where it preys on larvae of the moth Neodrepta

Polymerus testaceipes Stal, 1860 NEW STATE RECORD
Polymerus testaceipes was found infesting Gerbera jamesonii (gerbera daisy) cultivars in Volcano, Hawaii, causing significant damage to the flowers. Upon closer inspection, lygaeids, aphids, and thrips were also found feeding on the flowers at high densities, causing uneven opening, however, the mirid appeared to be a new species in Hawaii. Specimens were sent to USDA-ARS-SEL in January 2013 and identified by T.J. Henry in December 2014.
According to T.J. Henry, Polymerus testaceipes is a highly variable species distributed throughout the Neotropics and established in Florida. Recorded hosts include various Asteraceae species, Borreria verticillata (Rubiaceae), Chenopodium quinoa (Chenopodiaceae) (Logarzo et al. 2005), Phaseolus sp. (Fabaceae) (CABI 2015).

Piezodorus oceanicus (Montrouzier) Piezodorus oceanicus was first recorded as a new state
record from Maui by Howarth and Preston (2007) as P. sp. nr. grossi Staddon, 1997. In a subsequent survey and report, this species was identified and listed by Howarth et al. 2012 as P. hyberni (Gmelin, 1790).
A separate collection from Oahu in 2009 was independently sent by HDOA to Hemiptera specialist T.J. Henry, who initially identified the Oahu species as Piezodorus hyberni, but after closer examination and dissection confirmed that the Oahu population was in fact P. grossi Staddon and not P. hyberni. The Maui and Oahu populations were compared and verified as the same species. P. grossi Staddon, 1997 was synonymized under P. oceanicus (Montrouzier, 1865) by Cassis and Gross (2002) and therefore P. oceanicus is the correct and revised name for the species established on Oahu and Maui.

Members of Piezodorus feed on legumes and some species are significant agricultural pests. Historically, there was much confusion on the identity of P. oceanicus as it is difficult to separate many of these closely related species (Bundy et al. 2018).

Pseudococcus sp. A (nr. aurantiacus Williams and cryptus Hempel) NEW STATE RECORD
Specimens of an unidentified Pseudococcus sp. A were collected from Manila palm on Oahu and betel nut palm on Hawaii within the span of four months in 2010. Populations appeared small, with only a few mature females and several immatures found on each plant. Females sat upon ovisacs similar to those of P. cryptus. It did not appear to be causing any major damage to host plants, however, in each case, individuals were commonly surrounded by other palm pests, including Fiorinia phantasma and Aleurotrachelus trachoides.
Specimens were identified by D.R. Miller as Pseudococcus sp., apparently undescribed. According to Miller, “These specimens are very similar to P. aurantiacus Williams and might even be that species, but several details don’t fit. There are many more oral collars and multilocular pores on P. aurantiacus and the oral rims seem to be more consistently placed.” In these specimens, “the ‘oral rims’ sometimes are without obvious rims. It is also similar to P. cryptus, but has more oral collars on the thorax and head. This most likely is an introduced species, probably from Asian Pacific and needs further study.” Palm trees are commonly shipped between islands for landscaping purposes, and was the likely pathway between the two islands. This represents both a new Hawaii and U.S. record.

Vryburgia brevicruris (McKenzie) NEW STATE RECORD
Mealybug masses were observed and collected off Senecio

madagascariensis plant roots from around Hale Pohaku, off Mauna Kea access road (~9,300 ft elevation). The infestation was very low, and only a few mature females were found. Specimens were verified by D.R. Miller as Vryburgia brevicruris (McKenzie), a species typically found on aerial parts of its hosts. This species has previously been intercepted in Hawaii from Caralluma nebrowni (Asclepiadaceae) imported from California (holotype female), but has never been collected in the field until now.

Psyllidae Cacopsylla tobirae (Miyatake) NEW STATE RECORD
A suspected new psyllid infesting Japanese pittosporum (Pittosporum tobira) on the University of Hawaii campus in Manoa, Oahu was reported to HDOA in July 2013. Subsequent surveys found several sites with heavy infestations around the Pawaa, Honolulu areas on P. tobira plants. Specimens were tentatively identified as Cacopsylla tobirae (Miyatake) (Conant 2013) and forwarded to USDA-ARS-SEL quickly after. Identifiers at USDA-ARS-SEL could not provide a species identification and thus these samples remained unidentified.
A publication by Bertone in 2016 revealed that North Carolina State University was able to confirm the identity of C. tobirae collected in North Carolina in 2014 with the help of USDA-ARS-SEL. With this publication, additional samples collected in 2013 were resubmitted to USDA-ARS-SEL in June, 2017 and quickly confirmed as C. tobirae by Cheryle O’Donnell shortly after.
Cacopsylla tobirae, a native of Asia, is an invasive pest species of the common ornamental Japanese pittosporum plants and has been recorded from California (Percy et al. 2012), North Carolina (Bertone 2016), and now Hawaii. In 2013, severe leaf curl and stunting of terminal branches, as well as extreme sooty mold growth was seen on infested plants at several sites around urban Honolulu. Follow-up surveys in 2017 revealed that P. tobira plants at three of four sites with infestations in 2013 were removed, though it is uncertain why. It can be speculated that the infestation was so severe that plants were either dying or too hard to maintain. However, the original site at University of Hawaii Manoa maintained the plants. A much lower population density was found with the discovery of a pupal endoparasitoid. In May 2017, a species of Pysllaephagus (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) was found parasitizing the pupae at rates over 60%. This species is pending identification, but also appears to be a new state record for Hawaii.

Rhyparochromidae Horridipamera inconspicua (Dallas) NEW STATE RECORD
Horridipamera inconspicua is widespread in the tropics from the Ethiopian Region to South Asia and Japan. It is sometimes abundant in its preferred habitat, which is early successional disturbed grassland mixed with Euphorbiaceae weeds. Its hosts are unknown, but it presumably prefers grass seeds (Slater and Zheng, 1984).

Insecta: Hymenoptera Agaonidae Josephiella n. sp. A (apparently undescribed) NEW STATE RECORD
An agaonid wasp new to science was discovered causing galls on the stems of Ficus microcarpa. Terminal stems of affected trees appeared unhealthy with a sparse foliar canopy. Initial observers of this damage were under the assumption that the same species which causes leaf galling on F. microcarpa (Josephiella microcarpae) was also causing the galling on stems of the same plant. However, closer examination of the stem-galling wasps showed that while both the leaf-galler and the stem-galler are morphologically similar in many ways, this in fact may be a different species. Both leaf and stem-gallers can be found on the same plant. Jean-Yves Rasplus, co-author of the leaf-galling J. microcarpae, agreed that this could be an undescribed species and is currently working on its species description.
Subsequent to the initial discovery of this stem-galler on Oahu in 2012, infested F. microcarpa were quickly noted on Hawaii and Maui. In May, 2016, galled F. microcarpa stems with exit holes were collected from Molokai and in July, 2017, from Kauai. However, material from these islands were too old and no adults could be recovered. Therefore, we do not list the collection data below, and in the list of new species we noted a question mark next to these islands until the adults are confirmed. Josephiella n. sp. A, along with Josephiella microcarpae, lobate lac scale (Paratarchardina pseudolobata), and other ficus-feeding species has contributed to the weakening of large banyan trees on Oahu.

Aphelinidae Encarsia cubensis Gahan NEW STATE RECORD
Specimens of Encarsia cubensis were first reared from Aleurotrachelus trachoides (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) infesting pepper plant (Capsicum sp.) foliage in Hilo in 2008. E. cubensis is a parasitoid of various whitefly species, including A. trachoides and Aleurothrixis floccosus (Noyes 2014), two economically important pests in Hawaii.

Encarsia diaspidicola Silvestri NEW STATE RECORD
Pest calls regarding high infestations of Pseudaulacaspis pentagona attacking papaya trees in Manoa were reported in June, 2012. Samples of the scales were taken and held for emergence of any parasitoids that may be present. Unexpectedly, a species of Encarsia emerged, and was tentatively identified as E. diaspidicola Silvestri, and subsequently confirmed by G.A. Evans. Evans also revisited specimens which were reared from sago palm fronds infested with Aulacapis yasumatsui and other scale insects in 2008. He identified these as E. diaspidicola in 2012.
This was surprising not only because it would constitute a new record for Hawaii, but because Encarsia diaspidicola was a candidate biological control agent of P. pentagona (Diaspididae) in Hawaii by USDA-ARS-PBARC entomologists, and had not yet been released (Neumann et al. 2010). Shortly after the Oahu discovery, lab-reared E. diaspidicola were released on Hawaii island in papaya fields to control the P. pentagona infestations devastating this crop in Hawaii (Follett et al. 2015).

Eulophidae Cirrospilus sp. A (not C. vittatus) NEW STATE RECORD
When blister galls began forming on lemon-scented gum tree foliage in Aiea, Oahu, leaves were collected and held for the emergence of potential gall-forming insects. What was discovered turned out to be an assemblage of about six separate species. Additional samples from Honolulu produced similar results. All samples of Oahu Corymbia citriodora blister galls, produced Cirrospilus sp. A, Epichrysocharis burwelli (presumed gall former), and four additional species of unidentified Hymenoptera (Chalcidoidea). Cirrospilus sp. A is possibly a parasitoid species; however, it is unknown which of the five other species found in the leaf material may be its host. C. vittatus is the only other established species of Cirrospilus recorded in Hawaii (Kauai, Maui, and Oahu) but is known to attack Cremastobombycia lantanella (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae). The Cirrospilus reared from C. citriodora blister galls can be described as yellow, slender-bodied, highly patterned, with a somewhat iridescent thorax. Also see Epichrysocharis burwelli.

?Closterocerus sp. A (not C. utahensis)		 NEW STATE RECORD
Eucalyptus sp. foliage with blister galls collected from West Maui was held for the emergence of gall formers. At least two species of Tetrastichinae wasps emerged- a possible Closterocerus sp. A and an Ophelimus sp. A. According to La Salle (2005 pers. comm., 14 June), this possible Closterocerus sp. A is most likely a parasitoid of the Ophelimus sp. A, which is probably the gall former on this Eucalyptus sp. material. On Oahu, Closterocerus utahensis has been recorded attacking species of Liriomyza (Diptera: Agromyzidae). Also see Ophe-

Epichrysocharis burwelli Schauff New island record
Epichrysocharis burwelli is a blister gall former on lemonscented gum (Corymbia citriodora) leaves. It was originally described from California in 2000 (Schauff & Garrison 2000), but is most likely native to Australia. While E. burwelli is a presumed gall former in the C. citriodora material from Oahu, it may not be the only gall former of the six species which emerged from the same material. Also see Cirrospilus sp. A.

Pheidole navigans (= moerens) Forel New island record
This species was previously reported as Pheidole moerens Wheeler in Gruner et al. (2003) from Hawaii and by Starr and Starr (2013) from Maui. Sarnat et al. 2015 removed Pheidole navigans Forel, 1901 from synonymy with P. moerens after examining type specimens, as well as representatives from Hawaii. A single minor worker was collected from Lihue, Kauai at a rental car parking lot near the Lihue Airport (13.X.2015, ex. peanut butter baited vial, coll. B. Dietrich, voucher at HDOA), however, we cannot confirm P. navigans without additional specimens including major workers. We report the following Oahu collections as a new island record.

Ophelimus sp. A (maybe not O. eucalypti, not O. maskelli) NEW STATE RECORD
Ophelimus sp. A adults emerged from blister galls of Eucalyptus sp. foliage collected on Maui. La Salle speculates that this is most likely the gall former from this species of Eucalyptus. This is not O. maskelli (a known gall former on Eucalyptus causing problems in other areas of the world) and it may not be O. eucalylpti- According to La Salle (2005, pers. comm. 24 August), the taxonomy of these small gall forming eulophids on Eucalyptus spp. is unresolved, with most of the species (and probably some of the genera) being undescribed.

Trichomyrmex destructor (Jerdon) “dark form” Record of note/Establishment uncertain
Ants collected from Ford Island by a private pest control company were somewhat morphologically similar to local Trichomyrmex (= Monomorium) destructor populations, however, with minor differences and darker coloration. Individuals from this collection site were also similar to M. mayri (not established in Hawaii), however, DNA analysis (using COI) by R. Clouse and M. Janda placed this population within a T. destructor clade which falls between a T. destructor clade from Madagascar and a T. destructor clade from Melanesia, India, and Palau.
While this population falls within T. destructor, it is important to note that this potentially represents a recent and separate invasion of T. destructor to Hawaii. Further DNA analysis of local T. destructor populations should be done to verify this conclusion, however, the location and cicumstances of the infestation in addition to morphological differences point to a new introduction of a very invasive pest ant species in Hawaii.

Vespidae Polistes dominula (Christ) Establishment uncertain
Adults of the European paper wasp were first collected in the field in June, 2006 by the City and County of Honolulu Parks and Recreation personnel on Oahu (HDOA 2007). Workers were stung as they were trimming trees at Keehi Lagoon Beach Park, where a nest was subsequently found and collected from one of the trees. Keehi Lagoon Beach Park is in close proximity to the Honolulu International Airport and the Honolulu Harbor, which are both less than a mile away. Surveys following this discovery did not reveal additional adult wasps or nests.
A second collection of P. dominula from Volcano, Hawaii was reported by David Foote, U.S. Geological Survey, Pacific Island Ecosystems Research Center. A student on a school bus was stung by aggressive European paper wasps which flew in through the bus’ open windows. A nest was found attached to the outside of one of the windows.
Finally, a third collection of the European paper wasp was made when a nest was discovered attached to the undercarriage of an imported firetruck in Kahului after aggressive wasps were reported to be flying around the truck.
Polistes dominula adults have been intercepted at Hawaii ports of entry on numerous occasions, commonly hitchhiking in shipping containers, in Christmas tree shipments, and in nests attached to vehicles coming from the western mainland U.S. The three collections of this species have been found at large, though at circumstances that may not particularly confirm establishment. After nests were contained from all three collections, there have been no known reports of the European paper wasp known to the authors. The European paper wasp is known from cooler, seasonal climates. It is possible that this species exists in small numbers within similar habitats to Vespula pennsylvanica, and therefore, the two yellow and black patterned wasps could easily be misidentified if only flying in the distance. If the European paper wasp becomes well established, there may be concerns for native bees and lepidoptera, as well as its aggressive nature and propensity to sting people.

Polistes jokahamae Radoszkowski Previous misidentification & Synonym According to Carpenter (2008) Polistes macaensis (Fabricius),

now considered a synonym of P. olivaceus (De Geer), was recorded from Hawaii in the 1800s. However, a review by Carpenter showed that P. macaensis was a misidentification for P. jokahamae Radoszkowski. In addition, P. jadwigae Dall Torre as listed by Nishida 2002 is a synonym of P. jokahamae. J.M. Carpenter reviewed HDOA’s collection of Vespinae specimens and the misidentification of Polistes jokahamae under P. olivaceus. Adults of P. jokahamae correctly identified by Carpenter were collected on Oahu as far back as 1905, and on Hawaii island in 1988. This paper wasp is native from India to Japan and has been introduced to many Pacific islands by commerce. Vouchers at HDOA.
Vespula alascensis (Packard) Revised name
Close morphological and molecular evaluation of specimens identified as Vespula vulgaris from Europe, New Zealand, Australia, and the U.S. by Carpenter and Glare (2010) concluded that the N. American V. alascensis was previously misidentified as V. vulgaris, its close Eurasian counterpart. Hawaii adults previously identified as Vespula vulgaris were collected from Maui as far back as 1973 and verified by Carpenter as V. alascensis in 2011. This Hawaii population arrived from Northwestern North America probably as hibernating queens in Christmas tree shipments. Vouchers at HDOA.

Erebidae: Arctiinae Secusio extensa (Butler) Biological control release, NEW STATE RECORD
Secusio extensa was imported by HDOA to control the invasive weed Senecio madagascariensis (fireweed) in the Hawaiian Islands. After thirteen years of research and permit applications, S. extensa was released on Maui and Hawaii Islands in 2013. This agent is now established on both islands.
Secusio extensa larvae were collected at the Palehua-Palikea area, Oahu, on Delairea odorata vines being eradicated from the area. This collection was the first on Oahu, as this agent was not purposefully released on that island. Establishment is questionable, as Oahu does not have large concentrations of S. extensa’s host plants (S. madagascariensis and Delairea odorata). HDOA and Pulama Lanai have conducted releases on Lanai to control fireweed in the area, though establishment has not been confirmed. There have also been reports S. extensa sightings on Kahoolawe; however, no specimens have been obtained.

Steve Nakahara identified the specimens as mostly F. occidentalis, with some individuals exhibiting slight differences and informed us of a study by Rugman-Jones et al. (2010) indicating that Western flower thrips, F. occidentalis, is a complex of two cryptic species (western flower thripsL and western flower thripsG) needing further study and species name revisions. Through nuclear-mitochondrial barcoding, the authors discovered two distinct genetic entities, morphologically similar, and sometimes found on the same plants. Additional specimens from these collections were forwarded to authors Paul Rugman-Jones and Mark Hoddle for DNA analysis and subsequently all returned with as Frankliniella occidentalis, the invasive greenhouse/glasshouse strain (western flower thripsG). Frankliniella occidentalis has been recorded in Hawaii since 1966, however, this is the first record of the invasive greenhouse/glasshouse strain.

Insecta: Thysanoptera Thripidae Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) New strain record “invasive greenhouse/glasshouse strain”
Two farms on Hawaii island reported extremely heavy damage and high losses by thrips feeding to various plants and flowers, including jade vine, crown flower, chrysanthemum, and gerbera daisies in the summer of 2010. According to the growers, these thrips were exhibiting atypical pesticide resistance. Upon initial examination, these thrips appeared to have minute morphological differences from than typical F. occidentalis in Hawaii, and subsequently specimens were forwarded to USDA-ARS-SEL for identification assistance.

Insecta: Thysanura Lepismatidae Lepisma saccharina Linnaeus Establishment uncertain
The blue silverfish or common silverfish has been previously reported in Hawaii, but the earlier records were apparently based on misidentifications of Ctenolepisma longicaudatum (Escherich, 1905) (Zimmerman 1948a; Nishida 2002). L. saccharina is easily distinguished from C. longicaudata in life by its smaller size (body length 5–9 mm), shorter caudal filaments (a little longer than one half abdominal length), uniform dark slate-blue dorsal color, and quicker movements. In C. longicaudata, the body length is 10–13 mm; the caudal filaments are longer than the abdomen; the dorsal scales are silvery gray and often mottled; and its movements are slower and more directed towards cover. Additional diagnostic characters for L. saccharina are smooth macrosetae, caudal tergite slightly longer than wide with a truncate or slightly rounded hind margin, terminal segment of labial palpus large and wider than long, and presence of a group of about three macrosetae near the posterior margin along the midline of each abdominal sternite, which is far removed from the lateral group of ventral macrosetae (Wygodzinsky 1972). A single colony of
