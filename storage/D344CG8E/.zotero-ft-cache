Summary
Oryctes rhinoceros virus (OrV) is an unassigned invertebrate dsDNA virus with enveloped and rodshaped virions. Two cloned PstI fragments, C and D, of OrV DNA have been sequenced, consisting of 19,805 and 17,146 bp, respectively, and comprising about 30% of the OrV genome. For each of the two fragments, 20 open reading frames (ORFs) of 150 nucleotides or greater with no or minimal overlap were predicted. Ten of the predicted 40 ORFs revealed signiﬁcant similarities to Heliothis zea virus 1 (HzV-1) ORFs, of which ﬁve, lef-4, lef-5, pif-2, dnapol and ac81, are homologues of conserved core genes in the family Baculoviridae, and one is homologous to baculovirus rr1. A baculovirus odv-e66 homologue is also present in OrV. Five ORFs encode proteins
The GenBank accession numbers of the sequences reported in this paper are DQ665870 and DQ665871.

homologous to cellular thymidylate synthase (TS), patatin-like phospholipase, mitochondrial carrier protein, Ser=Thr protein phosphatase, and serine protease, respectively. TS is phylogenetically related to those of eukarya and nucleo-cytoplasmic large dsDNA viruses. However, the remaining 25 ORFs have poor or no sequence matches with the current databases. Both the gene content of the sequenced fragments and the phylogenetic analyses of the viral DNA polymerase suggest that OrV is most closely related to HzV-1. These ﬁndings and the re-evaluation of the relationship of HzV-1 to baculoviruses suggest that a new virus genus, Nudivirus, should be established, containing OrV and HzV-1, which are genetically related to members of the family Baculoviridae.
Introduction
The Oryctes rhinoceros virus (OrV) was discovered in the 1960s in Malaysia and has been effectively used to control the rhinoceros beetle (O. rhinoceros) in coconut and oil palm in Southeast Asia and the Paciﬁc until the present day [17, 21]. It is a classical example of successful inoculation and long-

term control of an insect pest, but surprisingly little is known about its genetics.
The virus consists of rod-shaped virions and replicates in the nuclei of infected cells [17, 35, 36]. On the basis of its (ultra) structure, OrV was previously considered to be a so-called non-occluded baculovirus (NOB) [18]. Due to the lack of occlusion bodies, it was later removed from the family Baculoviridae [29] and orphaned. There are a number of other rod-shaped non-occluded dsDNA viruses found in invertebrates [18]. The most notable example is Heliothis zea virus 1 (HzV-1), which has been identiﬁed in cultured insect cells but has not yet been observed in insects [2]. The genome of HzV-1 has been sequenced completely, but only limited genetic similarities with baculoviruses were found [5]. Taxonomically, HzV-1 remains an unassigned virus [30]. Another formerly considered NOB, the white spot syndrome virus of shrimp (WSSV), also has rod-shaped nucleocapsids, which are wrapped into an envelope giving it an ovoid appearance. It was recently classiﬁed as belonging to the novel family Nimaviridae [45]. The most characteristic feature of WSSV is the appearance of a tail-like appendage. A similar appendage is also present on OrV particles [18]. Thus, the question remained, what is the taxonomic position of OrV.
OrV contains a double-stranded DNA genome of about 130 kilobase pairs [7], ﬁtting in the size range of baculoviruses (80–180 kbp). Genetic variation exists, as evidenced by restriction fragment length polymorphism of OrV ﬁeld isolates [40]. A physical map of OrV has been constructed for various restriction enzymes, showing that the DNA is circular and contains regions with reiterated sequences [7, 32], but sequence information on the viral DNA is very limited. A segment of 4 kb was sequenced to design PCR primers for the detection of OrV [41]. It bears no signiﬁcant similarity to other sequences in the published databases. Therefore, we decided to sequence portions of the OrV genome until sufﬁcient sequence information was obtained to allow gene comparisons and phylogenetic analyses. For this purpose, the PstI-C and -D fragments of OrV DNA were cloned and sequenced.

Materials and methods
Virus, DNA cloning and sequencing
The O. rhinoceros virus (OrV), strain PV505, was used. Its DNA puriﬁcation and cloning of PstI fragments into the pBR328 vector were described previously [7]. For sequencing, the plasmids containing PstI-C and -D were subjected to EZ::TN transposon mutagenesis (Epicentre). Positive clones with the antibiotic resistance from both the EZ::TN transposon (Kanr) and the vector pBR328 (Tetr and Chlr) were selected and grown on LB medium according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Puriﬁed plasmids (Qiagen plasmid Mini Kit) were analysed using restriction endonucleases (RENs) to map the transposon insertion site within the cloned OrV PstI fragments. Sequencing was done by using the primers binding sites at nt positions 52–75 and 1907– 1931 in the EZ::TN transposon. To close sequencing gaps, primer walking was performed using OrV sequence-speciﬁc oligonucleotides. Sequencing was performed using an ABI 3730 automated 48-capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems) with the ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit version 3.1 by GENterprise (Mainz, Germany) (http:==www.genterprise.de=).
DNA sequence analysis
Sequences were assembled using SeqMan (Lasergene 5.0 software, Dnastar, Inc.). The trace ﬁles were checked by eye, and minor mistakes were corrected if necessary. The simulated restriction digestion of the sequences was done with the GeneQuest program integrated in Lasergene software. Methionine-initiated ORFs encoding 50 amino acids or more and showing minimum overlap (<40 bp) were identiﬁed using the ORF Finder program (http:==www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov=gorf=gorf.html) and GeneQuest program. ORFs with less than 50 amino acids were only considered as putative genes in cases of clear homology to ORFs in other dsDNA viruses. Homology comparison of all of the possible ORFs to public databases was done using the BLASTP, TBLASTN and PSI-BLAST programs [1, 42]. The following criteria were considered to assign a putative homologue to the OrV ORFs: (i) A BLASTP search showed a dsDNA virus match with an E value of 0.1 or less; (ii) Amino acid identity to dsDNA virus homologue was 20% or greater based on MegAlign clustalW analysis of entire ORFs; (iii) A conserved domain was found. The putative coding regions were numbered as OrV ORFs.
The sequences within 300 bp upstream of the start codon of each ORF were analysed for baculovirus-like early and late transcription promoters. Early promoters were deﬁned as either TATAWAW or TATAWTW (W ¼ A or T) alone (designed ‘‘E’’ in Table 1) or ‘‘E’’ with initiator motif CAKT (K ¼ T or G), 20–40 nucleotide downstream (‘‘E þ ’’ in Table 1). Late promoters contained the sequence DTAAG (D ¼ A, G or T). All ORFs were investigated for character-

istic sequence motifs using the InterProScan program (http:==www.ebi.ac.uk=InterProScan=) and the Motif Scan program (http:==myhits.isb-sib.ch=cgi-bin=motif_scan). To ﬁnd possible transmembrane domains (TM) and N-terminal signal peptides (SP) in the putative proteins, the TMHMM server 2.0 (http:==www.cbs.dtu.dk=services=TMHMM-2.0=) and SignalP 3.0 (http:==www.cbs.dtu.dk=services=SignalP=), respectively, were also used. Repeated and palindromic sequences were identiﬁed using the REPuter program (http:== bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de=reputer=submission.html), Tandem Repeats Finder (http:==tandem.bu.edu=trf=trf. submit.options.html), and GeneQuest program (Lasergene 5.0).
Phylogenetic analysis
Neighbour-joining (NJ), minimum evolution (ME) and maximum parsimony (MP) phylogenetic analyses were performed using MEGA 3.1 [27].
Results and discussion
Nucleotide sequence analysis
PstI fragments C (PstI-C) and D (PstI-D) of OrV DNA were sequenced and were 19,805 and 17,146 bp in size, respectively. This is in good agreement with the originally predicted sizes of 20.1 and 17.7 kb, respectively, as determined in agarose gels [7]. Compared to the whole genome (about 130 kb in length), about 30% was successfully sequenced. So far, these are the largest genome sequence fragments known for OrV. The sequence of PstI-D overlaps with a 4-kb fragment that was previously sequenced to provide the basis for a PCR detection method (AF126716) [41].
The AT contents of the PstI-C and -D are 58.6 and 58.0%, respectively. Previously, the AT content of the OrV genome was estimated to be 57% [35], which is in close agreement with our sequence data. The PstI-C and -D sequences were oriented clockwise in the circular OrV genome by comparing the positions of internal restriction endonuclease sites in the sequenced fragments with the restriction map of Crawford et al. [7] (Fig. 1). Given the fact that these are discontinuous sequence fragments, the starts of the PstI-C and -D were arbitrarily chosen to be base #1, respectively, to simplify the reading, and the successive nucleotides were numbered in clockwise direction.

Fig. 1. Physical map (PstI cleavage) of Oryctes rhinoceros virus genome DNA (redrawn according to Crawford et al.). Shadowed PstI-C and -D fragments were sequenced in this study and oriented clockwise in the map
A total of 40 methionine-initiated ORFs with 50 or more amino acids and minimal overlap with adjacent ORFs were detected in the two fragments. Only 15 ORFs showed signiﬁcant identity (21– 51%) to hypothetical or known proteins from other dsDNA viruses or cellular organisms (Table 1, Fig. 2). The orientation of the ORFs was not equally distributed; 24 ORFs (60%) were oriented clockwise and 16 ORFs (40%) counterclockwise (Fig. 2). In total, 6 ORFs overlapped neighbouring ORFs, and the maximal intergenic overlap was found between ORFs D14 and D15, with 39 shared nucleotides. The AT content of the predicted ORFs ranged from 52.8 to 75.7%, with an average of 59.2% (Table 1).
Gene content
Of the 15 ORFs with signiﬁcant similarities (21– 51%) to hypothetical or known proteins from other dsDNA viruses or cellular organisms, ten showed signiﬁcant similarities to ORFs of HzV-1. These ORFs include 3 homologues (C3, C20, and D17) of so far unique HzV-1 ORFs with unknown functions as well as 5 homologues of baculovirus core genes, lef-4 (D16), lef-5 (D7), pif-2 (C2), dnapol (C17), and ac81 (C14) (Table 2). DNA polymerase B is essential for viral DNA replication and is commonly found in all nucleo-cytoplasmic large dsDNA viruses infecting eukaryotic organisms. In contrast, lef-4, lef-5, pif-2, and ac81 homologues have been only identiﬁed in HzV-1 and in all baculovirus genomes sequenced so far [23]. Lef-4 encodes the mRNA capping subunit of the DNA-dependent

1 The ﬁve baculovirus core gene homologues (lef-4, lef-5,
dnapol, pif-2, and ac81) present in both OrV and HzV-1 are
marked in bold. 2 ‘?’: Unknown; ‘þ’: present; ‘À’: absent. 3 Six underlined HzV-1 ORFs homologous to baculovirus
core genes are detected in this study.

RNA polymerase, which is essential for transcription of viral late and very late genes [24]. Lef-5 appears to be involved in transcription as an initiation factor and stimulates the transcription of both early and late viral genes [13]. Pif-2 is located in occlusion-derived virus (ODV) and is essential for

the peroral infectivity of baculoviruses [39]. The function of ac81 is not yet known. Two other ORFs are homologous to non-conserved baculovirus genes. They encode a putative large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (D8), which is also present in HzV-1, and a protein (C6) with similarity to occlusionderived virus envelope protein 66 (ODV-E66) [16], which is absent in HzV-1. The other ﬁve ORFs showed similarities to cellular proteins (mitochondrial carrier protein, C7; Ser=Thr protein phosphatase family protein, C11; thymidylate synthase, C12; serine protease, C16; and patatin-like phospholipase, D2) (Table 1). A thymidylate synthase (TS) homologue was also found in HzV-1 and WSSV. Moreover, ten of these 15 ORFs contain functionally conserved domain and=or motif signatures, which further corroborate the putative biological functions of these predicted proteins (Table 1). However, the remaining 25 ORFs revealed no homology to any known gene. The three predicted short ORFs (<151 aa), D1, D20, and C1, might encode parts of larger genes extending beyond the cloned restriction fragments. They need to be re-evaluated when the complete virus genome is obtained.
The putative protein encoded by ORF D7 showed low global BlastP similarities to LEF-5 of baculoviruses and HzV-1 (Table 1), which results from its small size of only 78 amino acids (aa) in comparison with 230–315 aa for baculovirus LEF-5. PSIand PHI-Blast as well as BlastP against a local database containing all of the currently sequenced baculovirus genomes and HzV-1 revealed that ORF D7 is signiﬁcantly similar to the C-terminal end of baculovirus LEF-5. Furthermore, a C-terminal zinc ribbon domain required for the maximal late transcription activity [14] and characteristic for LEF-5 was also detected for the ORF D7 (Table 1).
ORF D6 gave a highly signiﬁcant Blast hit to ODV-E66 of Cryptophlebia leucotreta granulovirus (Table 1). ODV-E66 is associated with the envelope of occluded virions of lepidopteran-speciﬁc nucleopolyhedroviruses and granuloviruses, where it is highly conserved. It is transported to and localized in the intranuclear microvesicles, which is a prerequisite for the accurate morphogenesis of preoccluded virions [16]. The presence of odv-e66 and pif-2 in OrV suggests that the envelope of OrV may

have related structural features to that of HzV-1 and the ODVs of baculoviruses.
Many studies have stated that there were no occlusion bodies in OrV-infected cells or tissues [8, 17, 18, 33, 35, 47]. Under certain circumstances, however, polyhedral virus occlusion bodies (OBs) with a distinct paracrystalline substructure comparable to that of OBs of nucleopolyhedroviruses

(NPVs) and granuloviruses (GVs) have been observed in the nuclei of OrV-infected midgut epithelium cells of O. rhinoceros larvae [18]. However, a baculovirus-like OB protein gene could not be identiﬁed by DNA–DNA hybridization in a previous study [7]. The complete genome sequence and further studies of the protein composition as well as the pathogenesis of OrV will give insight

into whether there are any homologous or analogous structures of the OrV virion to capsid, envelope, and possibly OBs of baculoviruses.
A further striking feature of the partial OrV genome sequence is the presence of a putative thymidylate synthase gene (ts). TS plays an important role in the DNA replication of a cell or a DNA virus [38]. Although its distribution is ubiquitous in nature, a dsDNA viral TS homologue is found only in bacteriophages, chlorovirus, entomopoxvirus, herpesvirus, iridovirus, rudivirus, WSSV and HzV-1, but not in baculoviruses. Phylogenetic analyses of various TS genes originating from various viruses and cellular organisms clustered the OrV TS together with the TSs of eukaryotes and large eukaryotic dsDNA viruses (Fig. 3). The presence of putative genes involved in nucleotide metabolism, such as ts and rr1 (ribonucleotide reductase large subunit), suggests that the OrV possibly contributes to the synthesis of the required nucleotides, independent of the host cell metabolism.
Notably, an unusual feature of HzV-1 is the presence of a histone fold protein [12]. This protein is speculated to be involved in mediating protein-DNA interactions, and consequently to serve as a DNAbinding domain [12]. However, its homologue was not detected in the partial genomic sequence of OrV.
Taken together, the observation that 10 OrV ORFs have homologues in HzV-1 indicates a close evolutionary relatedness of OrV to HzV-1. This hypothesis is further supported by the phylogenetic analyses of the DNA polymerase from dsDNA viruses including OrV ORF C17 (see below).
A hemopexin domain was detected in OrV ORF D1. Hemopexin-like domains have been found in vitronectin [46], a cell adhesion and spreading factor in plasma and tissues, and in matrixins, members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family that cleave extracellular matrix constituents [9]. A baculovirus MMP was identiﬁed in Xestia c-nigrum granulovirus (XecnGV) and other granuloviruses, which may degrade the basement membranes that help to hold tissues together [25]. It has been suggested that this domain facilitates binding to a variety of molecules and proteins. Accordingly, the putatively expressed D1 protein may potentially help OrV to interact with host cell membranes in

order to trigger the virus infection or to assist in dissemination of the viruses. ORF D11 contains an esterase catalytic domain, suggesting hydrolytic activity of the putative protein. A PIN domain (PilT N terminus) was identiﬁed in ORF C3. While its function remains unknown, a role in signalling appears to be possible [6]. Since PIN domains are often present in nucleic-acid-binding proteins, ORF C3 may be involved in viral DNA replication or transcription. ORF C5 contains a tubulin chaperone cofactor A signature. Cofactor A is a chaperone involved in tubulin folding [31] and essential for cell viability [34], which hints that C5 may be involved in controlling cellular processes associated with the cytoskeleton during virus infection.
Promoter motifs
Baculovirus promoter motifs involved in early and late transcriptional regulation [11, 28] were identiﬁed in HzV-1 [5]. Since the gene content analysis of OrV indicated a close evolutionary relationship with HzV-1, it was important to know whether these promoter motifs are present in the OrV genome.
Twenty-eight ORFs, accounting for 70% of the 40 predicted ORFs, have an early promoter motif (Table 1). Of these, ﬁfteen ORFs also possessed an initiator (INR) motif. In ORFs C11, D8, and D17, the INR motif was found at 19, 8, and 7 nt downstream of the TATA element, respectively. In ORFs C12 and D13, the INR motif was found downstream of the start codon. A baculovirus late gene promoter motif was detected in 19 ORFs (Table 1). Both early and late promoter motifs were observed in 14 ORFs, which may allow transcription of these genes during both early and late stages of infection. Of the OrV ORFs, six possessed neither early nor late promoter motifs. It is possible that they may be transcribed from hitherto unknown promoter motifs. The presence of baculovirus promoter motifs in OrV, as is the case for HzV-1, supports the view that OrV is evolutionarily related to baculoviruses.
Repeated regions of OrV sequence

palindromic core and located at different positions in the genome, are a common feature of large, circular, invertebrate dsDNA viruses. They have been shown to function as both origins of DNA replication and transcriptional enhancers [26, 37]. Hrs have been found in most baculovirus genomes, and are also present in WSSV with no similarity to that of baculovirus [44]. Instead of hrs, abundant tandem repeated sequences were identiﬁed in HzV-1 [5]. Evidence for the presence of repeated regions within the genome of OrV was provided by Southern hybridization [7]. Within the PstI-D fragment of OrV DNA, a hr-like double repeat of 18 bp with a palindromic core was located at nt position 10660–10697 (Fig. 4). In addition, a short direct repeat sequence (14 bp) was also detected at nt position of 9234–9262 (Fig. 4). No hrs and=or tandem repeat regions were found in fragment PstI-C. No sequence homology between these OrV repeats and those of baculoviruses and other dsDNA viruses was observed.
Phylogeny
The DNA polymerase (type B family) was used to reconstruct the phylogeny of OrV. The DNA polymerase sequence is commonly employed to infer the evolutionary relationships of dsDNA viruses [3, 4, 19, 20, 22, 43]. It is also one of the 29 conserved core genes found in all baculovirus genomes sequenced so far. In total, 23 DNA polymerase sequences from different families of eukaryotic dsDNA viruses including nuclear and cytoplasmic large dsDNA viruses and one from an unclassiﬁed dsDNA virus group (HzV-1) were retrieved from GenBank, aligned and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. As shown in Fig. 5, the DNA polymerase tree clustered OrV together with HzV-1 with strong bootstrap support (71%), suggesting that both

viruses shared a common ancestor. They formed a monophyletic group and represented a sister group to baculoviruses (Fig. 5). Coincidentally, these viruses were previously considered to be related based on their rod-shaped virion=nucleocapsid morphology, replication in the nucleus of infected cells and occurrence in arthropods. The phylogenetic relatedness between OrV and HzV-1 as revealed by the DNA polymerase tree is strongly supported by the observed gene content in these taxa. Of the 40 ORFs identiﬁed for OrV, ten ORFs have homologues in HzV-1, and seven homologues (lef-4, lef-5, pif-2, dnapol, ac81, rr1, odv-e66) are present in baculoviruses. Since only 30% of the OrV genome has been sequenced, the number of common genes shared with HzV-1 and baculoviruses is likely to increase. So far, 29 core baculovirus genes are present in all sequenced baculoviruses from Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera [15, 23]. PSI-Blast analyses showed that HzV-1 shares 16 ORFs with baculovirus core genes (Table 2). Due to the low number of available baculovirus genome sequences at the time, six of these homologues were not identiﬁed when the genome of HzV-1 was sequenced [5] (Table 2). Baculovirus core genes confer basic biological functions in the infection process in vivo, in RNA synthesis and in DNA replication. Given the crucial functions of their encoded proteins during the viral infection and replication cycles and given the fact that many of these proteins are a part of multi-factorial and multi-functional protein complexes, their horizontal transferability seems to be less likely than the transfer of genes encoding proteins of less central importance. Hence, most, if not all, of these genes can be considered as phylogenetically ancestral and may have evolved under stringent driving forces. It is thus very likely that the homologues found in HzV-1 and OrV genomes are the footprints of a common ancestor of baculoviruses and HzV-1=OrV rather than the result of horizontal gene transfer. These ﬁndings indicate that both OrV and HzV-1 are distantly related to baculoviruses and share a common ancestor with them.
In conclusion, based on sequence and phylogenetic analyses, OrV can not be readily assigned to any currently known dsDNA virus family. Given the fact that OrV has high genetic similarity to

Distances were calculated using Poisson correction. Homogeneous substitution patterns among lineages with uniform rates among sites are employed for reconstruction of the tree. Gaps and missing data were excluded from the analyses. The robustness of the tree was tested using bootstrap analyses (1000 replicates), and the values above 50% are given next to the nodes. Neighbour-joining (NJ) and maximum parsimony (MP) analyses revealed similar tree topology. The names of the selected virus families are marked on the tree. Both OrV and Heliothis zea virus 1 (HzV-1) are indicated on a grey background. Names of species are followed by their GenBank accession numbers.

HzV-1, we propose to include HzV-1 and OrV as members of two different species in a new virus genus. We further propose the name Nudivirus for this genus. This name refers to the vernacular name and has been used for these viruses for a long time [2]. According to the effective rules of ICTV, a virus may not be named only according to its host, with the sufﬁx virus [10]. OrV was discovered and named more than 40 years ago, at a time when

ICTV was not yet even established. Huger proposed the name Rhabdionvirus in order to indicate the extremely destructive effect of the virus to O. rhinoceros populations [17]. However, Rhabdionvirus sounds very similar to the acknowledged genus Rhabdovirus (family Rhabdoviridae), and we suggest not using this historic name for OrV any more. In order to give OrV a name that is in agreement to the ICTV rules, we propose to rename OrV

to Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV). Accordingly, HzV-1 should be renamed to Heliothis zea nudivirus 1 (HzNV-1). In light of the phylogenetic analysis of the DNA polymerase and the observed gene content of OrV and HzV-1, we conclude that the proposed nudiviruses are much more closely related to members of the family Baculoviridae than to Nimaviridae. The complete genome sequences of OrV and of other non-occluded baculovirus-like viruses should provide indications whether these viruses should be considered as belonging to a separate virus family or to a subfamily within the family Baculoviridae.
