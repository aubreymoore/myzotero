1.0 INTRODUCTION
Background The joint meeting of the Pacific Plant Protection Organisation (PPPO) and the Regional Technical Meeting for Plant Protection (RTMPP) is held every three years. The two meetings bring together key representatives from the south-west Pacific region to:  provide a regional forum to interact, discuss, share and exchange ideas on plant health and
plant biosecurity;  provide a regional forum for the Pacific Community’s Land Resources Division (SPC-
LRD) to brief members on the achievements and deliverables of LRD to countries;  advise SPC-LRD on matters relating to plant health, plant biosecurity and the international
trade of plant and products, to assist SPC-LRD to strategically plan its agenda on these issues for the next three years;  meet the constitutional requirements of the PPPO as stipulated under the provisions of the PPPO Constitution (amended 2006); and  discuss and review the PPPO outcomes and work plan.
About the event The meetings were held consecutively at the Tanoa International Hotel in Nadi, Fiji, from 21 to 25 September 2015. The 8th Pacific Plant Protection Organisation (PPPO) meeting was held on the first two days (21–22 September) and the 15th Regional Technical Meeting for Plant Protection (RTMPP) on the final three days (23–25 September).
Participants included heads of quarantine and plant protection from 22 Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs), government ministries including development partners, research collaborators, international agencies such as FAO, and representatives from three metropolitan countries in the region – New Zealand, Australia and the United States of America (USA).
The main objective of the meeting was to formulate strategies in collaboration with NPPOs, regional and international technical institutions, and biosecurity and quarantine stakeholders on matters relating to the protection of biodiversity whilst facilitating trade. The regional plant protection and plant biosecurity agenda focuses on taking measures to prevent the entry of exotic plant pests, preparing to manage pest incursions, and developing management strategies for pests of economic significance.
The events were hosted by the Biosecurity and Trade Support and Plant Health thematic teams of the Land Resources Division (LRD) of the Pacific Community1 (SPC), which is the Secretariat of the PPPO, with funding support from Australian Aid. A side event was paid for by FAO under the EU funded Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs - 2) on the regional scheme proposal on harmonisation of pesticide registration. The TOR and composition of a Working Group (WG) were key issues discussed and recommended for endorsement.
1 Following a governing body decision in November 2015, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community is now known as the Pacific Community. The abbreviation, SPC, remains the same.

2.0 KEY SUMMARY POINTS
SESSION 1 Official Opening
The PPPO Secretary welcomed delegates before inviting the Deputy Director, Agribusiness and Trade, of SPC’s Land Resources Division (LRD), Dr Ken Cokanasiga, to make opening remarks. The importance of working together towards a common goal was strongly expressed by the Deputy Director. Dr Cokanasiga emphasised that such meetings must yield clear outcomes to result in focused and prioritised recommendations, based on the two key elements of research and biosecurity in the PPPO. He highlighted LRD’s main objectives of sustainable use of natural resources contributing to food security, and further added that SPC is developing a new strategic plan soon to be issued to SPC members.
Dr Cokanasiga then introduced Mr Tunabuna, Acting Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture, who delivered the keynote address and also shared a message of welcome from the Fiji Minister of Agriculture, Rural and Maritime Development and National Disaster Management, the Hon. Inia Seruiratu. Mr Tunabuna spoke to delegates about the government’s recognition of the increased risk of pests due to globalisation and the increased movement of plant products. He encouraged national biosecurity and plant protection organisations/institutes in the region to work together to prevent new pest incursions and to develop sustainable management strategies.
Before the commencement of the meeting and the introduction of delegates, the Secretary called for a minute of silence in memory of Pacific Plant Protection Organisation members who have passed away since the last meeting: Aleki Sisifa, Dr Titus Kakul, Roy Masamdu, Sada Nand Lal, Laisa Ralulu, Dr Kat Smith, Bai George, Meli Sabera, Luke Tirimaidoka, Dr Joeli Vakabua, Moses Asher, Valton Palsis, Rosa Kambuo and Ms Laisene Samuelu Tuioti Mariner.

 FAO sub-regional office was acknowledged for assisting with harmonisation of the legislation process, especially in aligning with the IPPC.
 The plenary/board was informed that there was limited funding for the Secretariat and noted the challenges with regards to national levels of government prioritising health and education sectors, as well as needing capacity development partners to provide assistance.
 Samoa and the United States acknowledged the leadership provided by the outgoing Chair from the Cook Islands.
2.4 PPPO Executive Committee Activities Report  The PPPO Chair presented the PPPO Executive Committee reports for 2013 and 2014 as required under the PPPO constitution. The reports highlighted matters concerning IPPC, presentation on PPPO work plan, report on RPPO technical meetings, regional standard setting etc.  Samoa moved to accept report and was seconded by Vanuatu.
2.5 Election of new PPPO Office Bearers  Melanesia nominated Vanuatu for Chair (Melanesia’s term to Chair)  Australasia nominated Australia as Vice-Chair.  Executive Committee – Fiji and New Caledonia (Melanesia); Tonga and Niue (Polynesia); Nauru and RMI (Micronesia), Australia and New Zealand.
2.6 PPPO Secretariat Update  The Secretariat reported on regional IPPC workshops 2013 and 2014 on Pacific participation in draft regional ISPM consultations.  The Secretariat recommended that PPPO members nominate suitably qualified representatives to attend these technical consultations on draft standards. The Chair noted it needs to be people that are familiar with the subject matter on the draft standards.  Samoa commented that the workshops provide good staff capacity development opportunities.  The Pacific region has unique characteristics and can offer a different perspective on draft standards. Australia and New Zealand suggested that countries need to prepare well in advance on draft standards before coming to regional standards workshops to allow meaningful discussion.  PNG supported and endorsed the recommendations. This was seconded by the Republic of Marshall Islands.
2.7a Report on regional IPPC workshops on draft international standards (ISPMs) Presenter:
 Provided an overview of 2013 and 2014 IPPC workshops.  Two draft standards reviewed in 2014.  Participation of PICTs in international standard setting processes is a core objective
of PPPO.  Workshops also considered two draft ISPMs.  PPPO comments entered on the IPPC Online Comment System.
2.7b Reports on the technical consultation amongst Regional Plant Protection Organisations (RPPO-TCs)
-3-

Presenter:  The technical consultations promote the development and use of standards and allow for concerns to be shared regarding phytosanitary issues.  Australia noted that the IPPC secretariat enhancement/evaluation looked at how to work better with RPPOs and that there were specific issues for PPPO. It was suggested that the PPPO members should consider using these meetings to ensure that the PPPO has a voice. PPPO members were requested to inform the Secretariat about issues of concern to take to the technical consultations.  The Secretariat advised that the regional technical consultation report is available on the IPPC website. It was recommended that the PPPO members take note of the report.  Papua New Guinea supported PPPO attendance at technical meetings.
2.7c IPPC Dispute Avoidance and Settlement System Presenter: Ms Lois Ransom
Bureau discussions included the following (see Bureau report June 2015):  Phytosanitary dispute is defined as disagreement over the imposition of a
phytosanitary measure between two or more countries.  CPM agreed that dispute avoidance should be the first step in solving phytosanitary
disagreements.  It was strongly recommended that countries avoid disputes with suggestions of
ways to avoid this lengthy and expensive exercise.  Countries can also look to standards for guidance and actively report non-
compliance.  There are steps that can be found on the International Phytosanitary Portal:
https://www.ippc.int/en/core-activities/dispute-settlement/
SESSION 3
3.1 Report on activities of the IPPC Presenter: Dr Bart Rossel and Ms Lois Ransom
 Not many Pacific members attended the last CPM. Funding available for developing countries to attend the meeting. Representation of the south-west Pacific region on the Bureau was an opportunity for the Pacific.
 Tonga noted concern with lack of nominations of experts from member countries to attend CPM, particularly on international movement of wastes, in particular from cruise ships with port visits picking up considerably in some Pacific ports. The Pacific loses credibility at CPM with no support for these standards, and emphasis for contracting parties to support standards put forward by the Pacific.
 Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, New Zealand and Australia support developing this standard on international waste and nominations to expert working group.
 Samoa to draft an intervention at next CPM to put back this standard.  Australia encouraged developing a regional approach to this issue, especially looking
at infrastructure and working with the shipping industry.
ACTION: PPPO Secretariat to send a reminder to IPPC contracting parties when nominations are required for CPM attendance.

Bureau
 The IPPC has a new Secretary who has already shown strong leadership and is keen to implement recommendations from last year’s IPPC secretariat evaluation. The CPM needs to provide clear guidance to the Secretariat on their needs.
 The Secretariat needs stable core funding. The Bureau met with the Assistant Director General of the Food and Agriculture Organization, Dr Ren Wang, who is supportive of the IPPC.
 There will be a global e-phyto symposium in Korea. North America is looking at funding a Pilot hub for e-phyto exchange. The APPPC is looking at e-phyto readiness for participation in a global pilot hub.
 The next CPM will be 4-8 April 2016. Korea is looking to host CPM but this is not likely to be until May 2017.
 There is a new focus by the IPPC on the implementation of standards beginning with a pilot on surveillance. The CDC has developed a manual.
 The IPPC is looking at developing a new strategic plan.  Tonga noted that it is important that the Pacific is involved in e-phyto and suggested
that PPPO needs to discuss on the e-phyto issue.
Standard setting
 Several standards have been subject to formal objections. Phytosanitary treatments as phytosanitary measures are now being drafted by the Technical Panel for Phytosanitary Treatments. This could be of great benefit to the PPPO region.
 A particular relevance to the PPPO is the treatment on Heat Treatment Forced Air for papaya for fruit fly which will be up for adoption at CPM this year if approved by the SC. Tonga noted concern on how specific the standard was and whether that would have trade implications.
 Dr Rossel noted that no experts were nominated for the expert working group for the waste standard in the Pacific, even though the topic was nominated by the Pacific.
 Tonga, Cook Islands, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Vanuatu noted concern about the movement of waste and agreed that a waste standard should be a priority for the Pacific.
 Tonga suggested that PPPO needs to make a firm decision on whether they want the standard and set up experts. Tonga confirmed to host a meeting of the expert working group.
 Australia confirmed that the draft standard on waste was recommended by the Standards Committee to be taken off the work plan. However this will only go ahead as a global standard if an intervention in made at CPM to keep the standard on the IPPC work plan.
 Fiji informed that it has a cruise ship waste management programme but would support the development of the standard.
ACTION: Samoa to draft an intervention to take to CPM to keep the waste standard on the IPPC work plan.
 Australia informed that PPPO could still develop a regional approach to waste whilst the international standard was being developed.
-5-

 Dr. Rossel noted that there had been ongoing discussion in the IPPC on the concept of a commodity standard.
 The surveillance standard (ISPM 6) will be reviewed in October.
3.2 IPPC Capacity Development Committee Presenter: Ms. S Jennings
 Presented on the phytosanitary information available from the IPPC website such as pest surveillance protocols, standards implementation manuals. The information is provided so that countries do not need to re-invent the wheel and can utilise existing information sources.
 Updated on phytosanitary capacity evaluation (PCE) as principal tool to evaluate capacities of quarantine systems.
 Requested countries to provide CDC with their priority training needs.
3.3 South West Pacific Regional Standard Phytosanitary Measures Presenter: Bart Rossel/John Hedley
 The IPPC has been working to develop a standard on sea containers. There will be a special session at CPM devoted to sea containers to look at different aspects including risk aspects, industry concerns and practical NPPO problems. Not all countries are aware of the risk of pest movement with sea containers. Next year there will be the third expert working group meeting.
 At the last CPM, there was a recommendation that NPPOs recognise the risk of pest movement with sea containers and should work with industries to manage this risk. Dr Hedley made reference to the code of practice of industries as a measure already introduced commercially to support clean containers.
 Cook Islands noted the draft regional standards for comments on movements of soil, rock, sand, clay, peat and water. Members need to make comments on the draft Regional Standard Phytosanitary Measures (RSPM) for sand and gravel movement.
ACTION: Cook Islands to provide copies of the regional draft on gravel and sand movement so that members can provide comment.
 Australia suggested that the draft sand and gravel RSPM be reviewed at the next PPPO regional draft standard meeting. The waste standard will need to wait on the outcome of the intervention on keeping the waste standard on the IPPC work plan.
3.4 Sea Container Hygiene System – underpinning Pacific wide imports and exports Presenter: Dr. Dave Nendick
 The Sea Container Hygiene system has been in development for 10 years now with the Pacific partnership with shipping companies and plant protection organisations.
 Started with PNG and Solomon Islands as high pest risk areas.  The Pacific accounts for 40% of all sea containers to New Zealand but carry 80% of
the biosecurity risk.  Main pests associated with sea containers are ants (LFA, crazy ants), giant African
snail, pests in grain and soil.
-6-

 Management strategies include baiting ants and preventing excess vegetation in container storage areas.
 Need to explore opportunities to discuss further hygienic systems, and offer training in auditing systems.
SESSION 4
4.1/4.2/4.3 PPPO Business Plan Presenter: Joshua Wainiqolo
 The Secretariat presented the PPPO work plan 2012-2018.  Discussion on sustainable funding of the PPPO work plan.  Tonga put forward a motion to bring meetings to biennial gatherings considering how
critical this forum is towards protecting Pacific plant resources. Similar views were shared by Papua New Guinea. Tonga noted the benefits received from APPPC in terms capacity strengthening, technical support and regular regional meetings.  FAO informed that the Southwest Pacific Ministers for Agriculture meeting held in Papua New Guinea noted the importance of PPPO. Particular concern is that the funding support for PPPO Secretariat and key activities which has been provided by the Government of Australia assistance under PHAMA will be phasing out soon.  The meeting requested FAO, in partnership with other stakeholders, to seek the necessary resources to facilitate the implementation of relevant activities identified in the PPPO Business Plan and work plan 2012-2018, and supported the need to identify long-term funding for the operation of the PPPO.  FAO proposed that the PPPO Board set up a mechanism to support the PPPO Secretariat in seeking funds and preparation of project proposals to key development partners and donor agencies. There is potential to tap into GEF funding on GEF 6, which gives priority to control of invasive species and biodiversity. This links well to the core services of the PPPO on border protection and effective biosecurity.  Tonga raised concerns about only meeting every three years and suggested PPPO to meet biennially. Tonga referenced the APPPC and their biennial system and noted that the IPPC meets every year. Tonga further proposed that biennial meetings should be put into the work plan. This would have budget implications. Papua New Guinea and Niue expressed support for this proposal.  Samoa suggested that the motion can be supported but financing can be an obstacle. Since Tonga proposed the idea of biennial meeting then it would be good for Tonga to kick start by hosting.  Fiji suggested that the PPPO could look at using other communication platforms. Nauru queried if moving to biennial meetings would possibly require the cancelling of other activities  FAO acknowledged finding sustainable funding for PPPO. Australia has provided support through PHAMA support since 2011.  New Zealand noted that biennial meetings are needed to be effective and will require time out of other work.
ACTION: PPPO Executive Committee work intersessional to update and prioritize the work plan.
-7-

ACTION: PPPO Chair and Secretary approach PHAMA for assistance (consultant) with drafting the work plan for presentation at the next Executive Committee meeting.
 Australia stated that there needs to be clarity on the necessity for biennial meetings and if this can be achieved through funding and not at the expense of other activities.
 Papua New Guinea queried whether three-year meetings have been effective.  The PPPO Board unanimously agreed to have biennial meetings.  APPPC is funded by member contributions.  FAO proposed that the NPPOs consider GEF funding on certain activities of the PPPO
work plan such as addressing invasive species and on biodiversity.  Samoa enquired of the possibility for PAPP funding next PPPO meeting as technical
knowledge exchange.  Suggestion made to take work plan to CRGA to assess targeted funding.  The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade funding Component 4 of
PHAMA to BATS for LRD with possible move to programme funding to SPC targeting biosecurity and trade.  SPC informed that CRGA was approached for PPPO funding and advised that the PPPO would need to apply for that funding from within LRD.  Australia stated that the three-year PPPO work plan should be developed as a marketing document to share with donors, and not necessarily for SPC to fund completely. Australia also highlighted the importance of prioritising activities critical to the region.  PHAMA supported the development of a robust and costed work plan showing priorities and ownership by national stakeholders. This would increase the likelihood of obtaining donor funding.  NPPOs were asked to lobby with their CRGA representative on PPPO work plan, once submitted.  Need to also look at non-traditional donors like Japan that are active in waste management.
ACTION: PPPO Secretariat to send out CRGA representatives list with contacts to PPPO members.
ACTION: PPPO members to contact CRGA representatives and highlight the importance of the PPPO and its need of financial support to deliver its work plan.
4.4 Phytosanitary capacity building Presenter:
 Presentation of information paper for noting and endorsement by the Board for the development of a project proposal for FAO to seek funds for capacity building to improve participation of NPPOs at CPM meetings and contribute to development of draft standards.
ACTION: PPPO Secretariat to draft funding proposal with assistance from interested PPPO members

4.5 PPPO Logo

-8-

Presenter: Joshua Wainiqolo
 The PPPO proposed the development of a PPPO logo to provide further recognition of PPPO and noted that RPPOS have their unique logos.
 Tonga supported developing a logo and a website.  Papua New Guinea supported the proposal and suggested that there could be a
competition through schools. New Zealand advised that it was important to have good designs so the competition should be aimed at the college/university level. Federated States of Micronesia suggested that there is a need to have information about the group to help designers.  PPPO agreed on developing a logo.
ACTION: SPC to initiate a competition, open to higher education institutions to design a logo for the PPPO.
4.6 Regional biosecurity plan of Micronesia and Hawaii Presenter: Joshua Wainiqolo
 Concern with movement of military personnel to Guam.  Secretariat to work with the University of Guam to finalise the regional biosecurity
plan.  FAO noted commitment under current CPF 2013-17 to Palau and Federated States of
Micronesia on biosecurity capacity strengthening. Palau has initiated a request for technical assistance while the Federated States of Micronesia is yet to submit a request  Board to note progress in the regional biosecurity plan.
ACTION: PPPO Secretariat to work with the University of Guam to finalise the regional biosecurity plan
4.7 Update on the CABI compendium development consortium/invasive species compendium Presenter: Joshua Wainiqolo
 Online login multiple access to crop protection compendium. SPC pays membership for multiple access of 6900 pounds (GBP).
 Member countries now have their online logins and access to CABI databases.  For the invasive species compendium, seven participants attended workshop in October
28-30 and looked at ways in which Pacific countries can give feedback and identified key users and ways the invasive species compendium can be used by the Pacific. The PPPO Secretary then presented the contributions.  The Secretary clarified that there was no savings on the CABI subscription being reduced which was a question at the last Executive Committee meeting.  Tonga queried why this significant amount was required. The Secretary clarified that the amount covered subscription for all countries.  Tonga further queried whether the subscription was being used and whether the money could be better utilised elsewhere. Samoa agreed it was important to establish the usefulness of the subscription as the money could otherwise be used on the pest list database.  Guam noted that they find the compendium useful and requested login details.
-9-

 Australia suggested doing a survey of database use before making a decision on subscription.
ACTION: PPPO Secretariat to conduct a survey on the use of CABI’s ISC and CPC in the next two months so that PPPO members can make a decision on subscription for 2016.
4.8 Regional Festival of Pacific Arts and MiniGames Update on Biosecurity Presenter: Mr. Feroz Khan
 Strategies to create awareness to countries on associated pest risks.  Fruit fly trapping/surveillance.  Post-festival review of traps for any new interceptions.  Assistance at border with items.  Technical advice filling in form to inform host countries of what materials are being
brought over.  Guam encouraged NPPOs to facilitate completion of forms ahead of time to provide
feedback on which items are allowable, and is working with APHIS and US Wildlife.  Tonga noted that in previous festivals there has been pest spread to host country.  Traditionally in Papua New Guinea, there is a lot of movement of plant material across
national borders.  New Zealand requested for feedback on success of awareness/technical assistance on
biosecurity at Pacific events
ACTION: Generic information on biosecurity to become available on SPC website for countries to help with their own preparation.
4.9 Quarantine awareness at PNG Pacific games Presenter:
 Went well and no biosecurity breaches.  Organised by NAQIA with five officers.
4.10 12th Festival of Pacific Arts Presenter: Dr. Elise Huffer
 The Council of Pacific Arts and Culture, much similar to PPPO, consist of cultural focal points and need to link to PPPO as Festival of Pacific Arts has implications on pest risks from movement of cultural items and materials.
 Need to have an e-newsletter and a festival manual to inform cultural focal points of national obligations to consult NPPOs on quarantine risks with 12th Festival of Pacific Arts in Guam in 2016.
 Expecting 2,000 to 3,000 delegates, not including visitor numbers and large numbers are expected to travel from the US.
 Need for good coordination and to be cautious at national borders for pest movements.

Niulakita.  Good facilities and resources are critical to keeping pests out.  Issue with New Zealand on breadfruit chips from Tuvalu. The size of chips has changed
where New Zealand no longer considers them chips.
Vanuatu  Category 5 Cyclone Pam affected southern Vanuatu.  No new incursions, good border protection and surveillance and training are top issues.  Four X-ray machines in Port Vila and Santo, with six ports of entry.  Biosecurity Bill being drafted and reviewed.  Cost of phytosanitary certificate is an issue with regards to movement of mats and
cultural items that have been confiscated at national borders.  Launch of handicraft manual to help Pacific Islanders with trade of cultural handicrafts.  Vanuatu had submitted a request for export of handicrafts (mats) to New Zealand MPI.  New Zealand is revising the text on the import health standards, which will be sent to
countries, and once approved, will then be adopted as an import health standard.  Australia and New Zealand are working to address the movement of cultural artifacts
by PICTs to update information for more efficient and safe movement of handicrafts.  On Fiji’s query if handicrafts undergo fumigation or not, PHAMA is working with
Vanuatu Biosecurity on a handicraft manual with country specific details.  Currently, all mats brought in to New Zealand will need a phyto certificate and now
revising the text to exempt smaller mats.  Fiji raised the issue that more Pacific travelers are taking handicrafts and therefore a
regional standard to facilitate taking handicrafts overseas need to be addressed.
- 15 -

 Australia responded that there is an international standard being drafted and may be out for comment next year. Australia is revising handicrafts conditions from several Pacific countries.
USA  APHIS Hawaii Plant Protection and Quarantine supports activities to the US territories,
as listed below.  The 2014-2015 pest survey assistance to US territories covers ants, fruit flies,
development of better control for CRB, and other pest surveys.  Kiribati requested and attended meeting in the US on market access for meat imports.  Food and Drug Administration handle requests on exports of food crops entering the
US.
SESSION 6
6.1 New Zealand MPI Market Access Update Presenter: Mr. Nacanieli Waqa
 Not much done in the last 2 years on developing new import health standards (IHS) as priority resources was mostly diverted to strengthening existing pathways especially for fruit fly host commodities. This was triggered by recent live fruit fly interceptions in New Zealand.
 MPI is moving from country/commodity to generic commodity IHSs for ease of establishing IHS by using pest and management measures information already available in MPI and consulting only those not reviewed previously. Consequently, public consultation (as required under WTO) will only be necessary for new pest(s) and new measure(s) not previously assessed by MPI and not for every country request as per the current system.
 Island cabbage IHS issued in 2012 and assisted by FAO.  Polynesian plum (for Cook Islands, Tonga, Fiji, Vanuatu and Samoa) and Mexican
limes (for New Caledonia) IHSs delayed due to a review by MPI of quarantine scales associated with the commodities. Review has been completed and revised risk status of the scales of concern will be factored when the IHSs are developed.  New Zealand requested to conduct pathway assurance audits to help especially with maintaining currently approved fruit fly host pathways.  Cooked breadfruit (commercial consignments through a commercial oven) from Samoa was approved in 2012 and trade has commenced.  Audits of national HTFA (Fiji and Tonga) treatment facilities as required under the bilateral quarantine arrangements (BQA).  New requests – watermelon and green papaya from Fiji, pineapple and zucchini from Tonga, pineapple from Samoa, tapa/mats from Vanuatu and handicraft from the Pacific.  Pest reporting under ISPM 13 from New Zealand to PICs and vice versa, re noncompliance issues to inform immediately.  Technical assistance such as technical training, export compliance and others.  Export trends over the past years were presented for on papaya, watermelon, taro, squash (New Caledonia and Tonga), breadfruit (big demand), bele since 2012 and frozen pineapple from Tonga.  Importance of exporting PICTs to New Zealand maintaining their pest surveillance frameworks was reiterated.
- 16 -

 Capacity building on treatment and management of treatment facilities and auditing of pathways are great needs in the region and should be seriously considered by the countries and the region.
 The science and research is very critical in market access and PRAs. Pacific region needs good scientists and research must be continued.
 Niue queried on length of market access request for plantain. MPI confirmed that all market access requests are taken through MPI prioritization and only those prioritized are progressed and their IHS developed.
 Tonga highlighted NPPOs reporting back to exporters who have been very frustrated with the lengthy processing time for IHS requests, and request for significant improvements in processing.
 Fiji requested for an official acknowledgement of receipt for their request on access for watermelon and green papaya so that farmers and stakeholders are notified. New Zealand will soon acknowledge Fiji’s request on market access for green papaya and watermelon once prioritization is completed and finalized.
 Fiji NPPO raised concern over SPC signing off on behalf of Fiji NPPO with regards to Fiji’s suspension of HTFA pathway. Call for more transparency and open communications.
 Fiji expressed greater need for more inclusive consultation when considering mutually acceptable approaches when addressing issues on market access and compliance.
 On interception of mealybugs as non-compliant, requesting trading partners to comply with international trading standards and what is fair under WTO and not to contemplate as NZ also subscribe to the same international standards. In the HTFA treatment pathway, mealybug surviving treatment is considered an ‘indicator pest’ for a possible fruit fly survival and under technical justification, New Zealand MPI made the call. All the issues regarding then non-compliance had been communicated to Fiji NPPO under ISPM 13. The HTFA suspension issue has now been resolved bi-laterally with a visit from a New Zealand MPI senior official and acknowledged also the involvement of Fiji government ministers in the engagement and suggest that it’s left at that high level but happy for a bilateral technical discussion session any time this week if Fiji requires.
 Difficult to get good scientific research results from some countries to help in prioritized existing IHS review, and in most cases, researchers and other personnel involved in the initial research are no longer in the service in the countries which makes it worse. Consequently, review projects could potentially be delayed or even dropped and not considered.
 Tonga also wanted trade figures for frozen produce presented in future meetings and not limited only on fresh exports.
 Samoa wanted fumigation certification to be fast-tracked, and cooked breadfruit pathway using earth oven/umu considered and approved. New Zealand confirmed that the certification referred to in the presentation is for frozen exported commodities (both fruit flies and non-fruit flies) in place for the required thermographs which can be proven expensive for exporters in PICTs. The certification was not for fumigation.
6.2 Australian Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Update Presenter:
 Risk assessment of fresh taro from Tonga and fresh papaya from Fiji.  Review import conditions for handicrafts.  PRA training on Pohnpei and Fiji.
- 17 -

 Risk assessment of fresh taro from Cook Islands and Niue, and fresh coconut from PICs.
 Low risk commodity such as coconut can be put on special assessment.  Review import conditions of fresh taro leaves from SPC countries.  Review import conditions of fresh limes from Samoa.  Review of fresh ginger from Fiji.  Australian Fumigation Accreditation Scheme (AFAS) extending program to Fiji. Also
looking at Methyl Bromide replacement treatments.  Minister very interested to improve IT connectivity for a four-year program looking at
import conditions with some pilot programs.  Looking at consistency of service delivery on imported orchids.  Consolidating import conditions for dried products.  Intercepted over 200 species of thrips and developing a risk analysis on thrips using a
modular approach. Pest group policy. Same outcome in PRAs. Will then branch out to other pest groups.  New treatments, alternative treatments, irradiation now picking import with lychees from Vietnam.  Irradiation concerns with food safety, 20 hosts can now be irradiated.  Awaiting legislation to update Biosecurity Act. BICON will be online from 12 October 2015, moving away from import permits to improve efficiency.  Tonga queried the 30-month time period on risk assessment on import legislation and who is replacing Semy Siakimotu. Australia responded that the IRA process is under review and currently out for consultation. Nick Nolan is the Pacific Officer for the Department of Agriculture under PHAMA.  Samoa query on fresh taro export access to Australia.  PHAMA engaging consultants to address research gaps to facilitate market access.  Samoa queried about PICs travelling to Australia and held-up unnecessarily with prohibited handicraft articles perceived with higher biosecurity risk.  PICs to notify Ms. Lois Ransom (Aust. Department of Agriculture) of such incidents of inspection officers not available at airport quarantine to facilitate queries.
6.3a Market Access Presenter: Mr. Lesio Saurara
 Reviewed current market access assistance.  Capacity building assistance to countries.  SPC capacity also needs strengthening to better deliver services to countries.  PNG pointed out to LRD that previously there was the specific regional plant protection
service that SPC was renowned for, but this specific strength has been diluted over the years, and funds hard to come by. The proposed CoE on biosecurity is trying to revive this regional plant protection service.
6.4 Review of harmonised biosecurity model legislation / 6.5 FAO TCP & MEAs-2 Projects in the Pacific /6.6 Harmonisation of Pesticide Registration/ MEAs-2 Presenter:
 FAO provided an overview of FAO Assistance to PPPO activities to the member countries under the Pacific Country Programming Framework (2013-17). The major TCP assistance completed including the following: i. Enhancing capacity in vegetable production in Vanuatu.
- 18 -

ii. Training of Trainers (TOT) on Integrated Rice Crop Management Project. iii. Strengthening Floriculture Development in Tonga for Income Generating and
Food Security. iv. Capacity building to promote adoption of techniques to reduce hazardous
pesticide use in Pacific Agriculture − Fiji, Samoa, Solomon Islands. v. GCP/INT/063/EC ACP/MEAs Phase 1 − Capacity Building related to

analysis protocol for Palau. xviii. Support to Atoll Research for Kiribati, Tuvalu and Republic of Marshall
Islands. xix. Review of Harmonised Biosecurity Model Legislation. xx. Capacity Building related to MEA Phase 2.
 Biosecurity legal framework/biosecurity Model Law finalised by SPC in 2007 for a harmonised regional approach to managing plant and animal health including risks from pests and diseases.
 Cook Islands, Fiji and Solomon Islands have adopted the Model Law. Others (FSM, Niue, Palau, Tonga and Vanuatu) are in the process of preparing bills.
 At the time, the IPPC Secretariat and FAO did not provide inputs into the Model Law. The IPPC Secretariat and FAO have recently reviewed the Model Law and informed SPC that in their view, it is not sufficiently aligned with the international standards developed under the IPPC and OIE.
 Why? The principles, concepts, protocols which underpin the standards under the plant health regime as developed under the IPPC are different and distinct from the principles, concepts, protocols which underpin the standards as developed under the animal health
- 19 -

regime. In combining plant and animal health, the Model Law fails to adequately reflect and differentiate these different regimes.  Discussion of the key elements which need to be included in the Model Law or any plant and animal health legislation to more closely align with the standards developed under the IPPC and OIE.  FAO discussed the report – plant health/IPPC parties legally obliged to adopt standards – OIE members not legally obliged but there is an expectation to comply with OIE standards for animal health.  For OIE members who are also WTO members, compliance with convention and related standards is more important.  Food safety not on Model Law. However, New Zealand Biosecurity Act 1993 and Australia’s Biosecurity Act 2015 partially covers food safety, as local examples.  Discussed three options:
i. Separate but coordinated and mutually reinforcing legislations for plant health and animal health;
ii. Amend Model Law; and iii. Amend Model Law and include food safety.  Requested Board to review the three options and respond with the best way forward on it.  FAO provided an overview of a proposal for a Pacific Regional Pesticides Registration Scheme, proposed under an EU-funded project on capacity building related to Multilateral Environment Agreements (MEAs). The objective of the regional pesticides registration scheme is to reduce pesticide risks and ensure their efficacy and quality through pooling of expertise; better informed pesticides registration decisions; and enhanced harmonisation. The regional scheme will strengthen the ability of the national units to have more effective control of pesticides.  FAO then presented the proposed institutional arrangements, the review and decisionmaking process and the next steps involving the establishment of a Working Group to develop the full proposal for the regional scheme. The PPPO members were invited to provide input into, and advice on, the proposed tasks and composition of the Working Group.  Recommendations:
i. Recognise the importance of the proposed regional pesticide registration scheme and its potential to provide significant contribution to the strategic objectives of PPPO.
ii. Endorse the proposed regional pesticide registration scheme to strengthen the ability of national agencies to have more effective control of pesticides.
iii. Endorse the proposed Tasks and Composition of a Working Group to develop a full proposal for the envisaged regional pesticide registration scheme.
ACTION: Review project proposal on the Registration Scheme.
ACTION: Recognise the importance of the proposed regional pesticide registration scheme and its potential to provide significant contribution to the strategic objectives of PPPO.
ACTION: Endorse the proposed regional pesticide registration scheme to strengthen the ability of national agencies to have more effective control of pesticides.
ACTION: Endorse the proposed Tasks and Composition of a Working Group to develop a full proposal for the envisaged regional pesticide registration scheme.

6.7 Pesticide Residues in Crops Presenter: Mr. Fereti Atumurirava
 A 2009 survey of vegetable farmers in Sigatoka valley on pesticide use showed farmers want new insecticides as current ones are not reliable.
 Diamond back moth (DBM) has developed resistance to common insecticides that is used against Brassica insect pests in Fiji.
 Paraquat has been extensively used and has a half-life of 1,000 days to disintegrate into the soil.
 Good Agricultural Practices not being followed resulting in the development of resistances with high residues in crops.
 Board to note three recommendations in this presentation: i. To recognise and support efforts to increase capacities in national awareness of the toxic effects of pesticide use in agriculture production. ii. To recognise efforts made under the ACIAR ICM and FAO TCP & MEAs two projects to reduce the use of hazardous pesticides in agriculture production.
iii. To recognise the importance in adopting insecticide resistance management strategies at national plant protection policies in the management of insect pest and diseases in crop production.
6.8 SPC Food Safety (CODEX) Updates Presenter: Mr. Lesio Saurara

 Pacific biosecurity NGO formed in 2013 of researchers at Victoria University.  Funded by New Zealand Aid Programme for five years to improve resources for ant
biosecurity and management in the Pacific.  Working in partnership with Kiribati and Tokelau, SPREP and SPC.  Linking New Zealand organisations and in-country partner to develop capacity in
invasive ant prevention and management.  Manage yellow crazy ants in Tokelau and Kiribati.  Pacific Invasive Ant Toolkit (PIAT) an online resource for prevention and management
of invasive ants.  Develop awareness materials and pool together existing resource materials.  A case studies database being developed and will be made available in toolkit.
6.9.1 Reviving Pacific Invasive Ants Prevention Plan (PIAPP) Presenter: Mr. Lesio Saurara
- 21 -

 Recommendations proposed: Adoption of the revival of the Pacific Ant Prevention Plan.
 Proposed new name Pacific Invasive Ant Prevention Plan (PIAPP).  Adoption of PIAPP logo.  Invasive ants becoming a problem with YCA, LFA and RIFA threats.  Papua New Guinea supports new programmes looking at easy access treatments for
these ants.  Australia queried what are the implications in priority for PPPO work plan, what are
resource implications needed for this initiative?  SPREP doing similar on invasive ants work.  Pacific Invasive Initiative (PIP) now ending and looking to hand over to SPC for
resource allocation.  SPREP can access funds from PIAPP, looking at GEF funding through environment
division.
ACTION: Board to support initiative and work in collaboration with SPREP to seek resources to address invasive ants.
6.9.2 USDA/APHIS – SPC capacity building update Presenter: Mr. Lesio Saurara
 On behalf of group, described the two-week plant health systems course on evaluating country quarantine systems at North Carolina which nine Pacific biosecurity officers attended.
 Looked at broad biosecurity issues even irradiation.  Hot water treatment as disinfestation treatment.  Database of what countries can export to US.  Each market access is one commodity per submission.  A model to compare to national systems in a developed country.
6.9.3 IACT Trade Facilitation Update Presenter: Mr. Samu Turagacati
 EU-funded project to strengthen economic integration and cooperation through trade.  Assisted with enterprise development, project ending in Feb 2016.  Speed up economic integration to reduce poverty and improve rural livelihoods.  Strengthen pack houses in Tonga, Fiji and Papua New Guinea to increase volumes of
export.  Shift from fresh exports to value-added products.  FSM have duty free access to US market  Every country must have a trade policy.  Country communications need improvement but very good dealing with private sector.
6.9.4 Pest Survey and surveillance programmes Presenter: Dr. Maclean Vaqalo & Mr. Tony Gunua
 General and specific plant health surveys carried out in American Samoa, Cook Islands, Fiji, Federated States of Micronesia, Niue, Marshall Islands, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.
- 22 -

 Delimiting surveys like ants in Nauru.  Pest surveys for Federated States of Micronesia on papaya mealybug, Niue on
mealybug, Tokelau on CRB and Fiji on chili pod disease.  Pest ID’s received and passed on to PICTs.  Most important diseases – TLB, yam anthracnose, black Sigatoka, BBT (New
Caledonia has done control), breadfruit rot (wind driven rain, cyclones), root knot nematodes and burrowing critical, mitimiti disease (affecting only the Solomon Islands).  Threats – banana Fusarium TR-4.  Options – restrict movement, vigilant inspection, awareness, surveillance and monitoring.
6.9.5 Safe Movement of Plant Genetic Resources Presenter: Ms. Valerie Saena-Tuia
 Centre for Pacific Crops and Trees (CePaCT) lab is the transit centre for plant genetic resources in the region and has a global role.
 Focus on food security through conservation, multiplication and distribution of plant genetic resources.
 Encourage non-contracting parties to ratify treaty to access new plant resources to improve resilient of local plant diversity.
 Virus testing facilities on new planting resources to ensure safe quality plating materials.
 Facilitate access to resilient varieties to be made available to farmers.  Supports ongoing regional taro breeding programme to build resilience of Cook Islands,
Tonga, Fiji, Vanuatu and other countries free of TLB.  Training and capacity building and awareness on new varieties.  Molecular (e.g. PCR), serological (e.g. ELISA) and symptomatology (e.g. grafting)
techniques used for testing crops for presence of viruses.  Challenges like advanced indexing methods not yet fully developed to avoid detection
of Badna viruses (sometimes referred to as dead viruses) thus delay sharing of unique crops.  Exchange of plant genetic resources is based on the use of protocols, import permits and phytosanitary certificates.  Provide TLB resistant varieties to the African communities affected by TLB and other regions (Europe, Asia and Caribbean) to support global food security under the SPC EU INEA (International Network for Edible Aroids) with CIRAD as well as the Global Crop Diversity Trust on conserving and sharing taro resources.  Use FAO SMTA (Standard Material Transfer Agreement) to facilitate sharing of plant genetic resources within the Multilateral System of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.
SESSION 7 This session involved Group discussions to look at topics raised in technical presentations.
SESSION 8 The PPPO Chair confirmed that Vanuatu will host (date: TBC) for the 9th PPPO Board meeting 2018.

15th REGIONAL TECHNICAL MEETING ON PLANT PROTECTION
SESSION 9
Welcome The 15th Regional Technical Meeting on Plant Protection was officially opened by the PPPO Chairman. The Chair thanked all those in attendance and said that the representatives can look forward to a fruitful week of discussion.
Election of Meeting Chair (Research) The members unanimously nominated Mr. William Wigmore (Director Research – Cook Islands) to be the meeting Chair.
SESSION 10 Emerging Pests and Pest Management
10.1a Status of Guam Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle Presenter: Dr Aubrey Moore
 Coconut Rhinoceros Beetles (CRB) were first detected in 2007; the Guam bio-type is genetically different from the Pacific biotype in that it is attracted to light at night.
 The CRB-Guam biotype is involved in new invasions in Hawaii; Port Moresby area of PNG; Honiara area of Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands; and may be the cause of increased damage in Palau.
 Adults feed on liquid/sap.  First discovered in Tumon Bay not far from Guam International Airport.  US$600,000 budget each year on eradication activities lead by the University of Guam
(UoG) and donor partners like APHIS.  Guam CRB resistant to all available OrNV isolates.  Actively trapping using various methods like Tekken fish net traps (no need for
pheromone) keeps 65% of beetles in container, and the Mark-Release-Recapture.  Current tactics of trapping, sanitation, and application of Metarhizium may reduce local
damage, but will do little to prevent an island-wide population explosion because most breeding sites are inaccessible (in jungle and/or on military bases).  Worst case: adults kill trees and larvae feed on dead trees.
RECOMMENDATION: Urgently find and introduce a density-dependent biocontrol agent for the CRB-Guam biotype to prevent massive destruction of Guam’s palms and to lower the risk of CRB-Guam invading other islands.
10.1b Emerging Important Arthropod Pests Presenter: Dr. Maclean Vaqalo
 Under NZ Aid Programme, SPC–AgResearch carried out CRB damage surveys in conjunction with virus, Oryctes nudivirus (OrNV) levels in Samoa, Fiji and PNG.
 Avoid spreading with movement of soil compost, infested areas to beetle-free areas.
- 24 -

 Asian citrus psyllid-as vector for Huanglongbing (HLB) disease.  Papaya mealybug – worst pest of papaya with a wide range of hosts, there is an effective
biocontrol available.  Fruit flies, Bactrocera spp.  Taro beetle, Papuana spp.  Cocoa pod borer, Conopomorpha cramerella, in Solomon Islands a non-damaging
biotype.  Giant African snail – awareness, management research.  Little Fire Ant, Vanuatu latest incursion.  Countries to develop more quarantine awareness, plus strict border inspection and
surveillance to keep new pests out.  Cook Islands, Tuvalu and Kiribati verified that GAS is not established in their
respective countries.  Need coordination from NPPOs to create awareness materials on emerging pests,
especially developing pest alerts to inform the region of new incursions.  New Zealand emphasised effective management of sea containers as they are potential
vessels for spreading new pests – likewise for aircraft cargo; NPPOs on sharing of information on new pests.  Samoa requested more technical assistance to address mites and nematodes.  FAO requested to confirm if Asian citrus psyllid is present within the Republic of the Marshall Islands. RMI Delegate Mr. Karness Kusto confirmed that surveillance recorded its presence in Republic of Marshall Islands. SPC to verify such alleged confirmation.  Australia is interested to look at the timeline of spread of these pests in PICTs and especially to conduct an analysis of pathways where pest incursions are spreading.  SPC encouraged countries to update national pest lists database from confirmed pest IDs.  New Caledonia reported recording presence of CRB in Wallis and Futuna. This was not a new record as far as SPC is concerned.
10.1c Rhinoceros beetle biocontrol Presenter: Trevor Jackson
 A joint project is being carried out for improved management of the coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros) (CRB) by AgResearch, SPC LRD, MPI Fiji, MAF Samoa and PNGOPRA. The project finishes in June 2016.
 CRB is native to South East Asian but was accidentally introduced from Sri Lanka to Samoa in 1909, where populations exploded in the absence of natural enemies.
 The Oryctes nudivirus (OrNV) is a virus that attacks the gut of CRB was introduced into the Pacific Islands from South East Asia in the 1970s and 1980s to control CRB.
 On release of infected beetles, the virus is transmitted to healthy individuals and weakens the adult population. Infected beetles die after 2-3 weeks.
 Virus can now be produced in tissue culture and a collection of virus strains is held at AgResearch
- 25 -

 CRB can be controlled areas infested with the original invasive biotype (CRB-Pacific) by IPM. Checking for damage, targeted response, re-release of virus, alternative biocontrols, sanitation, etc.
 A new biotype, CRB-G, was first found on Guam in 2007, PNG (Port Moresby) in 2009, Palau in 2014, Hawaii in 2014 and Solomon Islands in 2015; CRB-G is not affected by OrNV virus and is highly damaging and invasive.
 A new programme is needed to manage and limit the spread of CRB-G.  There is a need to define the threat of CRB-G by mapping distribution of CRB biotypes
and infective viruses.  Need to identify centre of origin of G-biotype to go back to look for a naturally
occurring biocontrol to repeat the success of the first phase of biocontrol.  The current NZ Aid Programme funded project, SPC-AgResearch with Fiji, Samoa,
PNG, ends in 2016.
Discussion  Tonga noted severe damage observed in Indonesia as compared to the Pacific.  New Zealand raised concern on the possible presence of other biotypes in the Pacific
region, but current and planned work should focus on the damaging CRB-G biotype.  Airports were the first places of new findings, as in Hawaii.  Tonga exports 1 million coconuts a year thus very concerned with CRB getting into
Tonga. Need to critically address pathways of pest movements for instance large Pacific events. CRB was first detected in Honiara at the arts village during Festival of Pacific Arts.  Question was raised of coconut palms resistant to CRB - Fiji said that all coconut varieties are affected.  A resort (Vunabaka resort) in Fiji was found with 504 CRB larvae and adult beetles collected from areas around the compost site. Highest collection from a single site to date.
RECOMMENDATIONS: PICTs require a regional concerted effort to: i. Create awareness to the general public about the emergence of CRB-G biotype to try containing it to prevent spread to other site islands. ii. Complete a survey of CRB DNA analysis in PICTs (Tonga, Tokelau, American Samoa, and Wallis & Futuna).
iii. Determine the specific origin of CRB-G biotype iv. Exploration of effective biological control candidates, especially virus from
native range of CRB Guam biotype. v. A need for proper research on improved management initiatives/practices to
counter CRB-G.
RTMPP should endorse the urgent need for a new project to fund research to reduce impact and counter the spread of CRB-G
10.2 Plant Pathology Fusarium wilt (Panama disease) Presenter: Dr Richard Davis
 The fungus stays in the ground for a considerable time.  Tropical Race 4 is most critical as it kills all bananas.
- 26 -

 TR-1 wiped out Gros Michel banana in 1960s.  TR-4 first appeared in 1997 in Australia near Darwin.  March 2015 TR-4 found in heart of banana industry in North Queensland, industry
worth AU$600 million.  Disease will not be eradicated but under very good control, just that one farm, spread
can be controlled, and no threat to PICTs with exports.  Biggest risk is movement of soil − sanitation of used vehicles/machinery, footwear, etc.  Countries to take heed of international movement of germplasm, returning seasonal
workers, and backpackers.  Second threat to note is a new cucurbit disease, cucumber green mottle mosaic virus,
found in the northernmost point of North Queensland 2015.  National management plan with all stakeholders now underway.
Asian Citrus Psyllid Disease Presenter: Mr. Tony Gunua
 All delimiting surveys in Samoa, American Samoa and Guam found psyllid/vector but no HLB bacterium presence.
 Difficult to detect as symptoms look like nutrient deficiency.  Papua New Guinea has HLB disease in the Vanimo area, and transmitted through
infected planting materials.  Survey in Samoa in 2012 found the pest. Considering follow-up survey to include
training and capacity building.  Important to maintain surveys and look for the disease once the vector is found as it
appears several years later.  Awareness and exploring legislation to enforce biosecurity actions is very important.  Explore bio-control options for the psyllid available from California but first consider
conducting an exhaustive host range testing.
New Banana Disease Presenter: Dr Richard Davis
 First phytoplasma, positive ID from PCR by Dr Carmel Pilotti from the Papua New Guinea Oil Palm Research Association.
 Found in Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands, banana wilt associated phytoplasma and could be indigenous.
 Need to do research on alternative hosts in other monocot plants.  Another major biosecurity concern with movement of tissue culture is the amount of
time before you can test for presence of a phytoplasma.  Need indexing for phytoplasma as well as viruses.  Cassava bacterial blight another disease on the move.  A new disease on Malaita as reported from Solomon Islands’ biosecurity (Francis
Tsatsia), symptoms appear burnt off plus typical bacterial disease symptom.
Bogia Coconut Syndrome Presenter: Mr. David Tenakanai
 A phytoplasma disease of coconut and also affected banana and beetle nut.
- 27 -

 The syndrome was reported in Madang Province in 2006, legislation came in place in 2011 and in 2012 nationwide delimiting survey was conducted.
 Containment with quarantine checkpoint at Tapo Creek, outside Madang Quarantine all live plants, betel nut seedlings, soil and live animals.
 Betel nut trade is huge and their movement is high risk.  CRB and Little Fire Ant other threats to coconut.  Ongoing challenges with phytoplasma disease in coconut, betel nut and banana, being
addressed by ACIAR projects.  Relocating Pacific coconut gene bank from Bogia is top priority, another option is re-
collecting new tall varieties and start over again which was endorsed by SPC at the PAPGREN meeting held in December 2014 in Fiji.  Recent regional meetings have endorsed duplication of the Pacific coconut gene bank to Samoa and Fiji and relocation within Papua New Guinea and prior research is needed.  Not yet confirmed that the disease is carried through the coconut embryo.
Management of invasive weeds in North Pacific Presenter: Mr. Poasa Nauluvula
 Weeds refer to unwanted plants, out of place, and compete for space and nutrients.  Example of weeds include false sakau (Piper auritum), chain of love (Antigonon
leptopus), ivy gourd (Coccina grandis), Bengal trumpet vine (Thunbergia grandifora), mile-a-minute (Mikania micrantha) and Honolulu rose (Clerodendrum chinense).  Very well supported weed management along with community awareness and information dissemination.  There is a pilot project managing weeds for biogas in Samoa funded through Australian Aid and EU using Merramia, as feedstock for generating biogas for households – efficient means for control of invasive weeds.  Samoa said that Mucuna is not only beneficial to replenish soil nutrients but can control Batiki grass which is becoming invasive in open paddocks.  Rust fungus released on Mikania had proven effective; partners to collaborate to upscale the biocontrol agent.  Another call for a website to manage and distribute good agricultural practices to countries.
SESSION 11
Information and Communications Presenter: Mr. Emil Adams
 Evolution of the plant protection information officer position previously supported by NZ Aid Plant Protection Service and EU Plant Protection in the Pacific project was integrated into Land Resources Division supporting all the other technical divisions.
 Reviewed plant protection information support extension and technical materials including media releases, pest alerts, pest surveys, technical factsheets, awareness materials on new pests and regional quarantine awareness targeting major Pacific events such as Festival of Pacific Arts and Pacific Games. Quarantine messages are to protect food security, biodiversity and culture.
- 28 -

 Moving to on-line distribution (cloud) of plant protection information through web portals and social media, allowing countries to download information as needed.
 Internet connectivity (on-line charges) in PICs is always an issue.  Promote incorporating communications strategy in project formulation to disseminate
plant protection information to targeted groups (information access) and to raise visibility of PPPO amongst stakeholders and the international community.  Demonstration of mobile app, Pacific pathogens and pests developed under the ACIAR/SPC Integrated Crop Management programme as a resource for plant health clinics.  Tonga wants development of a PPPO website, hosted with LRD for now.
SESSION 12 Land Resources Division Updates
Pest List Database (PLD) Update Presenter: Ms. Ana Tunabuna
 Record of pest incursions and pest interceptions at ports.  Pest List Database keeps two separate lists: public and non-public records.  Plant Health Surveys records to be used to update Pest List Database.  Completed five national country trainings.  Pest reporting option targeting non-contracting parties.  One channel of reporting for both Pest List Database and IPPC.  Tonga queried when was last time Pest List Database was updated with all available
information regardless if authenticated.  Chair pointed to pest recordings in the countries but this is not the true record.  Each country has its own stand-alone database and countries can generate and update
from own records.  If adding unauthenticated records, this needs to be indicated (checked) in the public box
beside the reference section  New Caledonia queried that for the French version, there is a limited availability with
IT issue – this will be looked into.  Countries have logged in problems at times.
RECOMMENDATIONS: a designated country staff to update the Pest List Database and ensure that online data integrity is maintained. Need to improve communication with Pest List Database administrator and Plant Health staff.
Biosecurity Information Facility Presenter: Ms. Luisa Korodrau
 Established in 2004.  Biosecurity Information Facility (BIF) website initially hosted at University of
Queensland, migrated successfully to SPC Noumea server in 2014. Need to migrate current Content Management System to Joomla to enhance accessibility by stakeholders.  Standard template for regional Biosecurity Information Facility Database is the Samoa SQUID. In 2014, Samoa approved the use of Airport and Seaport modules in addition
- 29 -

to import and export modules. These modules were trialed for Solomon Islands and Tonga. Work is currently underway on customisation for country implementation.  Regional Operational Manual currently edited and layout in progress. First draft to be reviewed by experts within SPC and PPPO.  In-country training conducted for Solomon Islands, Tonga, Kiribati and Niue.  Capacity building support provided to short term attaches from Vanuatu and Tuvalu.  Cooks interested in future training on the BIF Database.  BIF in Niue not working due to compatibility reasons.  Federated State of Micronesia interested in updating national BIF operations.  Same as Palau with staff moving away and no one to operate.  Samoa acknowledged assistance and looking forward to continuous capacity building in BIF operations.
SESSION 13 Country Reports
Australia  Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) is now called the Department of Agriculture.  New appointments: Head of the Department of Agriculture, Mr Daryl Quinlivan and Australian Chief Plant Protection Officer, Dr Kim Ritman.  New Biosecurity Act 2015 will commence on 16 June 2016, replacing the century-old Quarantine Act 1908.  Biosecurity Import Conditions (BICON) system is the new import regulation system that is being built to replace ICON, Australia’s existing import conditions and permit application system.  Construction of a new Commonwealth owned and operated Post Entry Quarantine facility at Mickleham, Victoria.  Australian plant health regulatory change – emergency measures for tomato, capsicum, carrot and some cucurbit seed imports, requiring molecular testing to certify seed is free from seed transmitted pathogens of quarantine concern.  Established surveillance programs exist for native locust: Australian plague locust (Chortoicetes terminifera), spur-throated locust (Austracris guttulosa) and migratory locust (Locusta migratoria)  Control of invasive weed species is estimated to cost over AUD 4 billion annually.  Pest Management - The Emergency Plant Pest Response Deed and PlantPLAN.  Pests that cannot be eradicated: Asian honey bee, myrtle rust and branched broomrape Philipanche ramosa (formerly Orobanche ramosa).
Cook Islands  Reported on procedures for the eradication of OFF since 2013.  Currently OFF is only on Rarotonga and Aitutaki; thus public awareness has been conducted to prevent OFF spreading to outer islands.  Cost for the whole operation was approximately NZD 245, 000.  Discussion of when to declare if a pest has been eradicated.
Fiji  Research activities in entomology, plant pathology and weed management.
- 30 -

 Priority: Installation of molecular (DNA) diagnosis laboratory for crop pests and diseases, pending operation of HTFA and PBM.
 Constructed new museum of insect collection, preservation and maintenance.  Research continues on biological control agents and public awareness.  Tonga queried about protein bait production for PPPO members, SPC responded that it
is working on a consultant on this issue.  Papua New Guinea commented on Fiji’s report on efforts to manage the invasive
African tulip tree problem. Papua New Guinea suggested that efforts should focus on the use of sustainable control methods like biological control which can give island wide control instead of herbicide treatments which are applicable only in limited cultivation situations. Papua New Guinea also reported that there are some potential natural enemies discovered in West Africa which are now available in South Africa which could be further tested for use in Pacific Island Countries where the problem is serious.  Need to evaluate protein baiting as attractants for fruit fly as they differ amongst the islands.
Federated States of Micronesia  Staffing and funding constraints: 18 quarantine officers. There are no entomologist, plant pathologist, veterinarian and nematologist.  International and inter-state quarantine. Total staff of 22.  Fruit fly surveillance - only one specie present: Bactrocera frauenfeldi  Pests/diseases of concern: papaya mealybug, coffee bean borer, whitefly, coconut rhinoceros beetle, little fire ant, red-imported fire ant, betel nut bud rot disease.  Whitefly and papaya mealybug under control in Pohnpei and Kosrae. There is need to determine presence of biological control on papaya mealybug in Kosrae.  Developing FSM National Invasive Species Strategy and Action Plan  Held pest/disease survey.  Established plant protection and biological laboratory;  Nation-wide consultation on Biosecurity Bill which is yet to be adopted/become law.  Participation at SPC Annual Quarantine Training – University of Guam, draft CRB, BTS and Invasive Ants Emergency Response Plans in place.  Main markets and exports: Republic of Marshall Islands, Guam, CNMI, Indonesia, Japan, HI, US Mainland; betel nut, kava, black pepper, hibiscus bark, breadfruit, yam.  Aiming at containerized exports via sea-freight in October 2015.  Challenges: islands scattered, transportation, technical capacity.
French Polynesia  Has 10 staff and 3 experimental stations.  Moved to new buildings with a tissue culture lab, molecular lab, chemical lab and an insect rearing building.  Variety trials conducted for taro, potato and cauliflower.  Pesticide trials resulted in farmers reducing use of chemicals.  Pesticide residue analysis of fruit and vegetables carried out.  Tissue culture of banana, taro and breadfruit.  IPM in tomato crops following tomato yellow leaf curl viruses detection in August 2014 (tolerant variety trials, pesticides trial against TYLC vector Bemisia tabaci, biocontrol project).
- 31 -

 IPM against fruit flies with releases of Fopius arisanus.  Bio-control against Brontispa longissima.  New pests such as coconut mite and mango blossom midge.
Guam/Micronesia  Congrats to Cook Islands for eradicating QFF via male annihilation.  Limited taxonomic experience.  High introduction rate for alien species, minimum five per year.  Many insects are undescribed.  3 major pests: Asian cycad scale, CRB and LFA. These are not just agriculture pest but also affects biodiversity.  No established biological control for cycad scale, CRB Met biocontrol only kills 20% of grubs, typhoons major contributor to explosion of CRB with feeding material.  List of new island records of incursions, some beneficial, sometime parasite come with pest.  Need to document better invasive species.  No agricultural export market to protect.  NZ on brown stink bug, just one interception, non - established, an escape from quarantine.

Kiribati  Very little work in plant protection.  Ship rat (R rattus) is damaging coconuts on all islands.  Taro beetle Phuebneri has spread to other villages closer to Tarawa.  Breadfruit fruit rot disease present and it is recommended to prune trees.  Oriental red scale in outer islands. Black beetle is a natural enemy but need a more effective biological control.  Mango fruit fly managed with lure control.  Formulate rat bait using local ingredients.  Yellow crazy ants outbreak in Kiribati addressed by the Pacific Biosecurity Team.

New Caledonia  Extraction of natural substances from plants to screen insecticides, attractants and repellents against fruit fly.  With the collaboration of the Chamber of Agriculture, some trials using Kaolinite clay (Surround®) against the fruit spotting bug on avocado gave some good results that will be used by farmers  A new database with taxonomic data is under development to give the Service d'inspection Vétérinaire, Alimentaire et Phytosanitaire (SIVAP) (Biosecurity service) some more details on interceptions that they constantly need to address.  Some current research undertaken to improve knowledge of the biological fraction of agronomic soils, especially arthropods, earthworms and nematodes and also bacteria and fungi.

Niue   

Vaipapahi Research Farm upgrade. Piggery re-stocked with improved breeds. Biogas and composting use pig manure.

- 32 -

 Management of sandalwood, local hardwood and forests.  Nursery – fruit trees and ornamentals  Received improved varieties of sweet potato from CePaCT.  Eradication programme for invasive weed.  Feral pig eradication program now implemented  Four-day working week (but paid for 5-days) is a challenge to extension services
delivery  Need to improve agricultural practices.  Cook Islands sent pineapples to Niue some time ago, but whereabouts unsure.  Received improved crop varieties from CePaCT including six varieties of sweet potato
from the United States Department of Agriculture and distributed already.  New TLB tolerant varieties provided by CePaCT were confiscated because of a
ministerial direction on the fear that traditional varieties might be lost due to cross pollination.  TCP on fruits and nut trees is up for implementation at the end of the year including upgrade lab.  Query on biogas generation as you need minimum of 10 pigs to operate a unit.
Palau  Three major pests – fruit flies, CRB, tilapia.  There are five fruit fly species in Palau.  Acknowledged the support provided by SPC, International Atomic Energy Agency and FAO.  Tilapia is a predator for crab and shrimps but is an edible fish.
Papua New Guinea – National Agricultural Research Institute (NARI)  Coffee Berry Borer is under surveillance next to the PNG-Indonesia border.  Coffee green scale is present.  Coffee Leaf Rust is re-emerging problem below 1600m with increasing incidences  Cocoa Pod Borer is found in all cocoa growing areas now. Management with IPM is being promoted. Now farmers putting more work in cocoa management with IPM practices.  Bogia Coconut Syndrome caused by a phytoplasma. ACIAR supports a project to determine the insect vector and recommend management strategies; while other support goes towards the relocation and duplication of the national coconut germplasm collection threatened by BCS.  Focus in oil palm production is on management of grasshoppers and stick insects, coconut leaf miner; involved with on the new CRB G-type and geo-referencing of weeds.  Projects implemented on sweet potato virus management, six out of 22 recognised viruses are in PNG and sweet potato weevil management, both Cylas and Eucepes.  Potato Late Blight - resistant clones from the International Potato Centre (CIP) breeding programme released to famers.  Capacity building pest identification, pest diagnostics and weed management.  Facilities available for plant protection research: - Dedicated work on BWAP similar to Bogia syndrome to address research gaps, for example, why coconuts are not affected outside of Madang Province.
- 33 -

- Research needs on organic management of pests and are there effective organic pesticides.
- Invasive weeds - chromolaena and others. - Research needs on climate change scenarios on pest and disease dynamics.  Challenges: - Lack of specialists plant protection staff. - Research has to be an integral part of any programme, example market access
programmes should address research gaps in pests and diseases and postharvest management, Pest Risk Analysis (PRA) etc. - Need to build capacity on postharvest research as it is closely linked to meeting export standards. - LFA is a pest and not to be encouraged as biological control for cocoa pod borer, as some researchers have been advocating. PNG said LFA will be gazetted as a noxious pest making it illegal for its use and spread.
Samoa  Conducts applied and scientific research  Varietal selection (taro, cash crops) use on-farm research and monitor from planting to harvest right up to tasting  Pest and disease control, IPM and ICM  Taro: nematodes, mites, export pathway, weed and yield, farmer field school  CRB management and surveillance work  Suitable coconut variety screening for VCO and fresh drinking.  Niu Afa, the largest coconut, is becoming rare so use Polymotu concept planting in isolated small islands to maintain purity of this large coconut.  Tunnel houses promoted for off-season production  Aid from China has seen the introduction of new vegetable varieties for screening and distribution.  Cooked breadfruit trials completed  Plant Health clinics, first training completed.  Common challenges with other PICTs, thus need to strengthen collaboration amongst the group.
Tonga  Staffing shortage on plant protection specialists  The SPC-ACIAR ICM is most successful programme so far  Breeding for TLB tolerant varieties from CePaCT  Sweet Potato weevils getting real bad  Insecticide Resistance Management (IRM) on diamond back moth very effective with demand for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) increasing.  Pest List Database updates  Cassava scale treatment with oil and soap, but this might be challenge with volumes.
Tuvalu  SPC pest and disease survey on Vaitupu  Interception of Dicranolaius bullulus, Nabis kingbergi and snake  Continuation of fruit fly surveillance and monitoring on all the islands  Currently, have two types of fruit fly species present, Bactrocera passiflorae (light form) and Bactrocera xanthodes.

- 35 -

Presenter: Dr. Bart Rossel
i. ISPM 6 collect and store information consistently ii. Use of P-tracker mobile surveillance tools iii. Can use at borders in the field iv. Geojot is the app, can use it also off the grid. v. Download direct to database on your computer and entries are updated with
matching fields.
SESSION 15 GROUP DISCUSSIONS
Group One - International Waste Disposal
Draft Standard: i. Existing draft to go back to NPPOs for support for re-submission to CPM ii. There are side events on media productions to showcase on impact of not properly disposing of waste.
iii. NPPOs have limited resources with no proper waste disposal facilities can approach donor community.
iv. Some countries might be too cautious forcing ships to dump rubbish in open seas and ending up on our shores.
Group Two - Managing pathways of new emerging pests
 Pathways cargo, vessels, mail, passengers, natural spread  Management measures for each pathway
i. Cargo: risk profiling, SVHS, trapping ii. Passengers: awareness, profiling iii. Mail: seeds plant material, detector dogs, X-ray machines iv. Plant material: import conditions v. Vessels: inspections vi. Natural spread: little control
Group Three: Trade facilitation and information systems
 Pest List Database – update pest status, pest surveys conducted in each PICs.  Authenticate records/publish literature  Training in scientific writing to publish research  Secure funding  BIF: Samoa only fully operational; need expertise to review BIF operations and become
operational, with refresher training for sustainability  E-phyto pilot programme; PPPO to develop a four-year project, set up by September
2016.  Market Access: system approach training, market access training, IRA/PRA training,
heat treatment and export systems  Develop website to put up information in 6 months.
- 36 -

 Urgent need to update pest data. Conduct pest surveillance in member countries. Can be split into sub-regions with more capable countries assisting other countries: PNG can assist neighbours in pest surveys.
ACTION: There is urgent need to setup a proper website for PPPO ASAP before the next meeting.
ACTION: Pest surveys required to update national pest lists.
Group 4 Management of African tulip
 African tulip is a threat to infrastructure, biodiversity, forestry and agriculture  HOAFS requested SPC to lead management in 2006 and again in 2008.  Two-phase research approach needed.
i. Phase 1, Genetic matching of invasive populations of the tree with native populations in Africa. This has been partially completed. Of the three subspecies in Africa only one is in the Pacific islands. A mite (Aceria sp.) is one potential biological control, host ranging in Rhodes University. Several other potential biological control agents are available
ii. Phase 2: funding is needed to complete parts of Phase 1 and Phase 2 which will include continue host-specificity testing, field releases of proven biocontrol agents and monitoring in a number of countries where approval is given. The project will be at least 3-5 yrs for at least one biocontrol agent to be released.
 Herbicide use is limited, recommended only in farming situations  Wood utilization is encouraged but will promote the proliferation of the weedy tree and
populations will continue to persist from re-growth at harvested sites and seeds blown from difficult to access forest populations.
Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle Presenter: Dr. Aubrey Moore
 Guam biotype is more invasive than PanPacific biotype and resistant to virus biological control and has invaded Guam, Port Moresby areas of PNG, Hawaii, Honiara, Solomon Islands and Palau, after no movement for 30 years.
 Behaviorally different from the Pacific genotype. Resistant to the biocontrol virus and is far more damaging. Not attracted to beetle lures, only about 1% caught so cannot be used as effective control.
 Developed a Work Plan  Program Organisation  FAO is now helping Solomon Islands to manage the outbreak of rhinoceros beetles
using the PanPacific virus, ineffective against G-biotype, Metarhizium fungus is a useful biological control agent but ineffective against the Guam biotype.
ACTION: PPPO and RTMPP request assistance from SPC to take the coordinating role to seek funding, establish and managed a programme to minimize impact from the newly discovered Guam biotype of coconut rhinoceros beetle.
Emerging Diseases Presenter: Dr R. Davis (viruses, phytoplasma)
- 37 -

 CGMMV – seed transmitted; which islands have the disease.  Test samples from 2000s  Start testing now on future surveys for cucurbits  Very similar to common cucurbit viruses, so it already could be here  Samples already collected from previous surveys could be tested to determine the
disease  Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) – is it enough?  Seed import protocols, organic seeds, farmer seeds, strict legislation to discourage
smuggling  Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), genus begomovirus,
i. Now in French Polynesia and New Caledonia ii. Not seed transmitted iii. Simple generic Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test available, surveillance
strategy iv. Transported by planting material (not seed), vectors v. Big diversity, new Gemini-viruses popping up have affected legumes as well,
Solanaceous vi. Molecular recombination producing new diseases is an additional threat. vii. There are tolerant tomato varieties
RECOMMENDATION: PPPO to approach NZ MAFF and request CGMMV testing of desiccated historical specimens collected in PICTs from 2002-2007 and all future surveys to target this virus
RECOMMENDATION: PPPO to endorse begomovirus surveillance strategy for PICTs prioritising French territories, and Cook Islands
 Emerging Diseases (viruses, phytoplasma)  Can ACIAR be lobbied for a new BWAP Project?  Limited knowledge available  Some awareness like pest alerts, already in Solomon Islands  Review germplasm movement, tissue culture (TC) plants ensure phytoplasma free.  FAO to consider seed quality from Asia, and put quality control measures/mechanisms
on imported seeds. Proposed putting up a centralised place to screen seeds for diseases.  Propose a regional project on establishing a seed screening centre  Tonga said that on International Seed Testing Organisation, there is a draft standard on
seed movement on IPPC, a commodity standards, but this is still a long way.
RECOMMENDATION: NPPOS to review current seed importing procedures in view of risks associated with seed transmitted viruses.
RECOMMENDATION: Endorse development of a project proposal for research into the banana phytoplasma problem
RECOMMENDATION: Endorse a study to determine the movement and pathways of five important emerging pests in the PICTS.
RECOMMENDATION: Conduct studies to determine the effectiveness of horticultural oils in managing invertebrate pests in PICTS.

Invasive Ants Presenter: Dr. Carol Russell
 The highly dangerous Red Imported Fire Ant (Solenopsis invicta), is currently absent in the Pacific but will get here if not prevented.
 Little Fire Ant (Wasmannia auropunctata) is present now in eight countries including Hawaii. It is having an impact on tourism, agriculture, livestock, and people including agriculture workers, electrical wiring, and wild life.
 YCA is a nuisance, affects homes, land crabs, coconut crabs, etc.  Tropical Imported Fire Ant – painful sting but not as dangerous as Red Imported Fire
Ant.  Actions: prevention if not in a country, stop local spread, awareness, legislation,
biosecurity actions to be taken including movement of clean containers, inspections  Surveillance is not practical all year round, pick likely spots like high risk ports  High risk countries are those which do not have the ants yet but are likely to receive
incursions due to linkages  Management – soils containing ants can be treated with Methyl Bromide but this
pesticide will be phased out soon.  Things to consider: what is the goal, plan you have to manage the pest and list out
management options  Termites – another social insect such as the Asian Subterranean termite which was
detected in Lautoka, Fiji should also be a target for countries to prevent spread or control. It not only destroys wood in homes but is also a pest of fruit trees such as breadfruit, avocado and other useful trees. A control method being promoted in Fiji is to turn off lights and light a fire so that termites will fly into the fire during mating season.  Consider change to Pacific Invasive Ant Prevention Program
RECOMMENDATION: PPPO and RTMPP to endorse revival of Pacific Invasive Ant Prevention Plan (PIAPP) and target 4-5 specific ant species of concern to be addressed.
Information sharing related to new pest incursions
 ISPM 17 and 8 are relevant here  SPC pest alerts  PPPO mailing list  Approval by NPPO prior to make official announcement  Inform trading partners  Report pest incursions through International Plant Protection portal  WTO/IPPC Notification - countries need to aware of the notification process  Recommendations:
i. GAP Analysis on notification ii. Verification and simulation iii. National Emergency Response Plan endorsed by NPPO iv. Capacity building on regional Emergency Response Plan, pest reporting,
simulation exercises, checklist on notification process as there are three means of notification
- 39 -

SESSION 16 New Projects
POETCom Presenter: Mr. Stephen Hazelman
 Organics to reduce chemical use  35 members in 15 PICs  International certifiers like NASA, Biogro  Development and certification use of Organic Pasifika  Composting, crop rotation as practiced in Solomon Islands on four-acres of land by Dr
Tutua  Rejuvenate depleted soils  Promote mucuna bean (Mucuna pruriens)  Cuba experience  Working with SPREP  Request PPPO to look into (1) importing beneficial organisms, and (2) biopesticides  Tonga on movement of international wastes; cannot use human waste compost  Work with Tonga National Youth Congress  Only poultry manure from certified farms  Need technical help from government on certifying processes.  Would consider using local worms rather than importing. Experience in PNG
introduced worm compacting the soil
RECOMMENDATION PPPO and RTMPP to continue to support POETCOM and the development of Pacific organics
Regional Centre of Excellence for Biosecurity and Trade Facilitation Presenter: Mr. Lesio Saurara
 PNG have reservations with this suggestion as the Centre of Excellence is not on a specific issue. SPC used to provide excellence in plant protection services in the past, but this situation has since been diluted as LRD becomes integrated. Dedicated plant protection funding is hard to come by; however, plant protection remains critical especially for SIDS, and so this Centre of Excellence is trying to address that.
 SPC mentioned that the proposed Centre of Excellence will include plant protection, animal health, biosecurity technologies, trade facilitation issues in line with the broader integrated mandate of LRD
 Standard Trade and Development Facility (STDF) is keen on the proposal for the Pacific, including funding of a consultant to come across to prepare and refine a proposal for the Centre of Excellence.
 Not necessarily to be based at SPC but aspects of the work may be located at another partner institute, depending on the nature of the science/technology being developed. There is also a need to consider plant health, animal health, post-harvest technologies, biosecurity treatment issues for the Pacific countries, and their sustainability.
 FAO raised concerns that the proposed Centre of Excellence for Biosecurity and Trade Facilitation’s scope of work will cover crop production, plant protection, animal health services & plant genetic resources. Are they LRD services now? How does the PPPO Secretariat fit into this proposed Centre? Funding to operate? Need to assess carefully,
- 40 -

as there was an earlier proposal for a regional pest diagnostic service. Need to identify what will be key services by the Centre, as well as funding source.  Tonga requested if the Centre can look at acquiring pesticide testing kits for the pesticides residues in vegetables.  Fiji commented on sustainability, and promoted the idea for collaboration with a national university where there is capacity of scientists and graduate students to do research on the technical issues and build the capacity of national academia.  SPC LRD has moved away from plant protection solely and into broader areas like animal health, climate change, sustainable management of resources, and of course biosecurity and trade. The broader issues include addressing topics such as developing regional frameworks, emergency response plans, resource mobilization, strengthening linkages and networking with metropolitan partners and academia; these are all in line with the objectives of the proposed Centre of Excellence  PNG said that the proposal needs to look at constraints, opportunities, what is the problem we have, what is the need, and with involvement of animal health and other sectors, Biosecurity is related to trade and the focus and the mandate of PPPO. The Centre is more focused on a broader mandate and so there is a need to re-look at objectives. The Centre must include pest management as well, instead of just biosecurity and trade facilitation.  SPC will consult relevant stakeholders including PPPO for their input in developing the proposal.
PPPO/RTMPP noted the presentation on the establishment and sustainability of a Regional Centre of Excellence (RCOE) for Biosecurity and Trade Facilitation within SPC’s Land Resources Division. Agreed to progress the development of the RCoE proposal with the development of a Concept Note to the Standard Trade and Development Facility (STDF) to fund a consultancy to develop a project preparatory grant
