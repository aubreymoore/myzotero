•	Frosty pod rot (page 4) is one of the most severe

diseases of cacao (cocoa). From its probable origin

in Colombia in the early 1800s, it spread through

the north of South America, Central America, and

Mexico. The disease is still on

the move and was detected in

Bolivia in 2013. By June 2015,

growers in that country’s main

cocoa-producing region had

lost over 50% of their crops.

	 Cacao is grown on many

islands in the Pacific, but only

on a small scale. One reason

is a disease called black pod,

which has similar symptoms.

Our “Not Wanted” poster also

compares frosty pod rot and black pod rot. Be alert! Though frosty pod rot is half an ocean away it can travel long distances

WANTED
The New Pacific Pests & Pathogens App

	 Pacific First Detectors and others might be interested in the Pacific Pests and Pathogens app recently released by Grahame Jackson and his colleagues at PestNet. The app is free and can be downloaded from the Google Playstore for Android devices and from iTunes for Apple devices. The fact sheets are also available online. v

	 After choosing the crop of interest, a series of simple questions are asked that narrow the choices until a match is made and compared with thumbnail images. Each fact sheet has sections on damage, biology and life cycle, and management. 	 There are now 236 fact sheets, but this number will increase. There also will be shorter, less technical fact sheets for those less familiar with English.

	 When a pest attacks, growers need immediate help. Often they cannot wait. If they don’t act quickly, their crop could be destroyed. 	 This app gives extension staff and growers the information they need to manage the pest. If the crop cannot be saved, suggested steps can help prevent or reduce the problem in the future.

Information provided by Aubrey Moore, an entomologist at the University of Guam.

NOT WANTED Pandanus Scale (Thysanococcus pandani)
AB

CD

Images and information courtesy of Hawai’i Deptartment of Agriculture (A–B) Feeding by pandanus scale causes light green and yellow areas on leaves that turn brown, dry out, and then die. Heavily infested leaves are discolored, brittle, twisted, and stunted. (B) Early infestations of this scale are difficult to detect without magnification due to the small size of the first instar or crawler stage, about 0.3 mm. (C–D) Adult females attach themselves to the undersides of leaves but will settle on upper surfaces as their populations increase. They are 0.6 mm long and form a white waxy ring around their oval, black bodies.

Origin, Distribution. First reported from Indonesia (Java) and Singapore. Detected in Hana, Maui in 1995. Small populations were found on Oahu in 2013 and Molokai in 2014.

Likely Locations. Wherever Pandanus species are present. Because of their small size, the first instar or crawler stage can be moved by wind, other insects, or animals. People can unknowingly move pandanus scale from infested areas on their clothing, or on leaves or fruits of infested plants.

Hosts. Possibly all Pandanus species, including P. penangensis, P. utilis, and especially P. tectorius in Hawaii. Impact. Pandanus scale reduces fruit production and weakens and kills trees and seedlings. Heavy scale infestations can cause the loss of an important tree species from costal ecosystems as Pandanus inhibits invasive species and helps prevent coastal erosion. Pandanus is important in many island cultures, especially for weaving. Severe scale infestations make the dried leaves useless for making mats, baskets, and other articles.

NOT WANTED Frosty Pod Rot (Moniliophthora roreri)

(A) Young fruits (pods) of cacao (Theobroma cacao) infected by Moniliophthora roreri are chlorotic, swollen and misshapen. Infected pods are heavier than healthy pods and seeds already may be damaged. (B) Advancing necrosis of frosty pod rot has uneven borders (white arrow) and when mycelium of the fungus first appears it is felty and white.
Origin & Distribution. Central and South America. Possible origin in Columbia (1817), and then Ecuador in the early 1900s, Venezuela (1941), Peru (1950), Panama (1956), Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, and Belize, and then Mexico in 2005. Reports of the disease in Bolivia in 2013 were confirmed in 2015.
Hosts. Fruits of Theobroma cacao (cocoa) and other species of Theobroma. Herrania species can act as reservoirs of the disease.

(A) Late in the disease cycle, at about 50 to 60 days, the mycelium turns from white to cream colored. (B) In the final stages of the disease the mycelium is tan to light brown. Pods begin to shrivel and become hard. These “mummies” do not fall from the tree, but remain attached to their branches and produce spores.
Impact. Frosty pod rot (Moniliophthora roreri) can have a major economic impact on fruit production and is reported to cause twice the damage of black pod rot (Phytophthora spp.). Yield losses average 30%, but can be up to 90% depending on crop and disease management and the environment. For example, over 50% of Peru’s 16,500-ha cacao cultivation has been abandoned and frosty pod rot is the major factor affecting yield in Central America and Mexico with losses of 80% and more. Likely Locations. Natural spread of the disease is mainly by wind-blown spores of the fungus; the mycelium on one mature pod can produce 7 billion spores. Long-distance spread, however, is usually on infected fruits during international trade. This may be accidental due to the long period, one month or more, between infection and appearance of the first symptoms.

Frosty Pod Rot Black Pod Rot

Frosty pod rot (left) has not been reported in the Pacific Islands, but black pod rot (right) has.
HERE ARE SOME WAYS TO TELL THESE TWO DISEASES APART.

•	 Frosty Pod Rot Life Cycle (about 85 days) –– 30 days: fruit distortion –– 40-70 days: brown necrotic areas on fruit –– 50-90 days: mycelium and spores on fruit

•	 Black Pod Rot Life Cycle (about 10 days) –– 5 days: brown spots on fruit –– 8 days: spots merge and cover the fruit –– 10 days: mycelium and spores cover fruit

•	 The frosty pod pathogen, Moniliophthora roreri, •	 Black pod, caused by Phytophthora spp., attacks

only attacks pods of Theobroma species. (Note: In-
