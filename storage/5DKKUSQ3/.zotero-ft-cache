Abstract
Five species representing the family Cydnidae sensu lato are recorded from Guam; three of them are reported for the first time from the island: Byrsinus varians (Fabricius, 1803), Fromundus biimpressus (Horváth, 1919), and Rhytidoporus indentatus Uhler, 1877. The widespread species, Fromundus pygmaeus (Dallas), was recorded by Ruckes (1963) and verified by us. The occurrence of a fifth species, previously listed from the island by Ruckes (1963) and Lis (1996), namely Adrisa flavomarginata (Vollenhoven, 1868), is regarded as doubtful. Of four currently known burrower bug species occurring on Guam, three are Oriental and one is American in origin. A key to all burrower bug species known from the island is provided. Additionally, Microporus shiromai Froeschner, 1976 from Hawaii is regarded as a junior synonym of Byrsinus varians (Fabricius, 1803).

Introduction
Although the burrower bug fauna of the Oriental and Australian Regions is relatively well known (see, e.g., Lis 1994, 1996, 1997, 1999a,b,c,d, 2000a,b, 2001; Lis and Heyna 2001), some of the Pacific islands are still unsatisfactorily explored. Literature data (Ruckes 1963, Lis 1996) record two species of this family from Guam: Fromundus pygmaeus (Dallas, 1851) and Adrisa flavomarginata (Vollenhoven, 1868). However, an accurate identification of the latter species was regarded by Ruckes (1963) as almost impossible and very questionable because all three of the specimens available to him were very badly damaged. Therefore, only a single burrower bug species (i.e., F. pygmaeus) can be regarded as positively recorded from the island. As a result of our studies, we record three species new to the island and document the occurrence of F. pygmaeus. We did not discover specimens of A. flavomarginata.
Additionally, Microporus shiromai Froeschner from Hawaii is regarded as a junior synonym of Byrsinus varians (Fabricius).
Beginning in 2004, RSZ began to work with personnel at the University of Guam to better understand the insect fauna of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. The primary purpose of these studies is to verify existing records and to document more recent introductions to Guam. Guam is a primary area of military, business, and tourist movement, and introductions are common and sometimes devastating to the native fauna and flora as well as to the economy. It is important that we have an understanding of those species being introduced to the island so that when necessary, best management practices can be implemented.

Material and methods
The majority of the material for this study was gathered by the second author (RSZ) during ongoing insect diversity studies on Guam. In this paper, we also include some specimens collected on Guam that are housed in the B.P. Bishop Museum, Honolulu, Hawaii. All specimens collected for this study were taken at lights. Those specimens collected by RSZ were taken at a series of fluorescent lights that lined the outside of a threestory laboratory and office building (Marine Biology Laboratory) near the University of Guam campus. The area surrounding the building consisted of general vegetation and grasses on a sandy soil. Specimens were also collected at the Fadian Point aquaculture lab at a 150-watt mercury vapor lamp (BioQuip Products), which was situated in a grassy area surrounded by shrubby vegetation and trees.
The external morphology concept follows Froeschner (1960) and Lis (1994). A general distribution of the species follows Froeschner (1960) and Lis (1999c, 2006). Specimens are deposited in the collection of the first author (JAL), the James Entomological Collection at Washington State University, and the Wilford Leon Guerrero Insect Museum at the University of Guam. Material borrowed from the Bishop Museum is housed in that collection.

Remarks: When describing Microporus shiromai as a new species from Hawaii, Froeschner (1976) was aware that this species was introduced into Hawaii from elsewhere; however, he decided to describe it as a new because, as he wrote, “this recently collected species needs a name, under which accumulating data can be stored.” Moreover, he stated that “its occurrence on the island represents a recent introduction,” and all the morphological characters “suggest an Old World origin of the species, but give no clue to a particular part thereof.” At present, it is clear that M. shiromai has all of the characters of the Oriental B. varians, and should be regarded as its junior synonym. Unfortunately, the type specimens were not found in Froeschner’s collection (personal information from Dr. A. Wolski), and therefore the present synonymization is based only upon the original species description.

Adrisa flavomarginata (Vollenhoven, 1868)
Remarks: Three badly damaged specimens, tentatively identified as A. flavomarginata, were recorded from Guam by Ruckes (1963); nevertheless, he was aware that identification of those specimens was doubtful. At present, it is impossible to determine the correct generic and species placement of that record. Because the presence of A. flavomarginata in Guam can not be completely excluded, the species is placed in the key to the Cydnidae of the island, and its dorsal body habitus is presented on the photograph (Fig. 13).
Distribution: Australia, Guam?, New Caledonia.

Discussion
Of the four burrower bug species currently known from Guam, three are of Oriental and a single one is of American origin.
F. pygmaeus is one of the commonest and widespread burrower bug species known from the Old World tropics and subtropics, and therefore its presence on Guam, as recorded by Ruckes (1963) and verified through this study, is not a surprise. The status of the two other Oriental species, F. biimpressus and B. varians, recorded for the first time from the island, probably represent somewhat recent introductions. As neither species was recorded from the island by Ruckes (1963), we can probably regard them as being introduced to the island during the last 50 years. But, it is possible that these species might simply have been overlooked by Ruckes.
The biology of most tropical burrower bugs is relatively unknown and we can add little to this knowledge based on our efforts in Guam. All specimens used in this study were taken at light traps in fairly nondescript habitats. In Hawaii, and in the Orient as well, B. varians (= Microporus shiromai) has been somewhat studied (Froeschner 1967; Lis 1994; Lis et al. 2000) and is regarded as a serious pest of pearlmillet, Pennisetum typhoides (Burm.) (Ghauri 1975; Lis 1994; Lis et al. 2000). Although this species of millet is absent from Guam, three relatives occur there (Meyer 2000), namely P. setaceum (Forssk.) Chiov., P. purpureum Schumach., and P. polystachyon (L.) Schult. It is possible that at least one of them has become an alternative host for B. varians, which could make it a pest on Guam.
Most surprising on Guam is the presence of the American species, R. indentatus; our most commonly collected species. This species has been recorded from Hawaii (Froeschner 1967) and it may be a recent introduction to Guam via that route. However, we cannot be certain of this.
Other species of burrower bugs may occur on Guam. Our collecting was limited to a small area near the University of Guam in Mangilao Village, which is located on the eastern shore of the island. Surveys need to be conducted throughout the island in differing types of habitat to gain a more thorough understanding of the burrower bug fauna.

Acknowledgements
We wish to thank Ms K. Kami (Bishop Museum, Honolulu, Hawaii) for the loan of the specimens used in our study, and to Dr. A. Wolski (Plant Protection Institute, Sosnicowice Branch, Poland) for his help in tracing the Froeschner types during his visit to the Smithsonian Institution in 2008. Drs. Aubrey Moore and Ross Miller of the University of Guam have been especially generous in supporting this and other studies on the island.
