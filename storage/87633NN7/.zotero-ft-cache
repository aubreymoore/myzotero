The susceptibility of Urycres rhinoceros adults to infections due to entomopathogenic

fungi (Beauveria bassiana. Beauveria tenella, Metarrhi:ium

anisopliae. Paecilomyces

fumoso-roseus.

and Spicaria rileyi) was studied by spraying titrated spores suspensions on

the insect integument. The results show adefinite susceptibility of the adults to Merarrhizium

anisopliae str&s of the major type only.

The susceptibility of Oryctes sp. (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae) larvae to the mycosis caused by Metarrhizium anisopliae (Fungi Imperfecti, Moniliales) has been reported several times since Friederichs’s (1919,192O) observations. Until recent years, a detailed biological study of this injurious insect of palms has been difficult because of the high natural mortality caused by this fungus during the rearing of the insect. It is only recently (Hurpin and Mariau, 1966; Hurpin and Fresneau, 1966, 1967, 1970) that these difficulties have been overcome, which has encouraged the development of research to find a means of control most adapted to the particular ethology of this coleopteran.
If the introduction of a viral disease
caused by Rhabdionvirus appears to be a promising biological control method (Marschall, 1970; Hammes, 1971; Monty, 1972; Zelazny, 1973), the research on the potentialities of M. anisopliae should not be neglected (Nirula et al., 1955; Rhada et al., 1956; Marschall, 1968; Diomandi, 1969). Recently, the specific action of certain strains of entomopathogenic fungi on Oryctes larvae has been emphasized (Ferron and Diomande, 1969; Ferron et al., 1972). In this study we have examined the susceptibility of Oryctes rhinoceros adults to several entomopathogenic fungi.

MATERIAL AND TECHNIQUES
Culture of insects. The adults were obtained from an insectary stock that has been maintained at La Mini&e for several years (Hurpin and Fresneau, 1967). The stock of Oryctes was reared in groups of ca. 100 larvae in 1 cu. meter containers. However, these experiments were made with lots of 10 or 20 adults individually reared in 250-ml cylindrical plastic boxes two-thirds filled with moistened peat. The tests were conducted at 28°C and examined weekly for 4-5 mo.
Contamination by fungi. In addition to M. anisopliae, the Oryctes were subjected to contamination by other fungi: Beauveria bassiana, B. tenella, Paecilomyces fimosoroseus, and Spicaria rileyi. However, the largest number of experiments was carried out with different strains of M. anisopliae, classified as either the minor or the major types according to the separation established by Johnston (1915) and revived by Veen (1968). The characteristics of the strains used are given in Table 1.
Multiplication of the conidiospores occurred on agar nutritive medium, in Roux flasks, at the optimum growing temperature for each species. The inocula were prepared as homogenized aqueous suspensions (supplemented with Tween 80 in a concentration of 0.2% in the case of Metarrhizium), ti-

controls. During each

weekly examination, the cadavers were set in

a humid chamber to promote the external

development of the mycelium. The diagnosis

was made according to the morphology of

the conidiophores and spores formed. A

more detailed microscopical examination

was essential in the specific cases of infection

by strains of M. anisopliae in order to differentiate the strains of the major type or of the minor type according to their respective sizes.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Age influence of the imagos on susceptibility to the green muscardine disease. Due to the longevity of the Oryctes imagos (up to 6 mo or sometimes more under our rearing conditions), two preliminary experiments were made to determine the influence of the host age on susceptibility to the mycosis. These experiments were carried out with two strains of M. anisopliae (M.a. No. 51 and M.a. No. 66). Lots of insects 1,2-4,7-9, 1618 wk old, respectively, were infected under identical conditions by suspensions of spores titrated to 1.lo2 to 1.lo7 spores/ml.

The values presented in Table 2 show that, in general, we obtained a mortality due to mycosis with about 50% of insects sprayed with 10 ml of a suspensioncontaining l.105 conidia/ml. However, practically all the lots were attacked by the fungus in higher concentrations. A graphic calculation of the 50% lethal time (LT,,) does not reveal differences in susceptibility to infection according to the age of the insect at low doses: with a concentration of 1.lo5 spores/ml, the LT,, was 95, 85, and 100 days for insects 1, 4, and 6 wk old, respectively, when infected with strain M.a. No. 51; and 65, 75, and 60
days for the lots of insects 1, 2-4,7-9 wk old when infected with strain M.a. No. 66. This uniformity was not observed when the infection involved higher doses. Thus with strain M.a. No. 66 at a concentration of l.lO’/ml, we obtained a LT,, of 45, 35, and 15 days for adults 2-4, 7-9, and 16-18 wk old, respectively.
Because of the age of insects used in the experiments can cause a marked variation in the responses obtained, this variable was avoided in later experiments by using only lots of insects of the sameage(4 wk old).
Susceptibility of Oryctes rhinoceros imagos to Beauveria bassiana, B. tenella, Paecilomyces fumoso-roseus, and Spicaria rileyi. The contamination of insects was achieved by spraying with titrated suspensions of l.104 to l.108 conidia/ml. Under theseconditions, no caseof mycoses was observed regardless of the speciesor the strain of fungi used. With the Beauveria bassiana No. 32 strain, it was necessary to utilize a more concentrated pathogenic inoculum, 1.lOg conidia/ml, in order to obtain four casesof white muscardine diseasefrom the ten infected Oryctes.
Comparative susceptibility of adults of Oryctes rhinoceros to the major and minor forms of Metarrhizium anisopliae. Because it was demonstrated in former studies (Ferron and Diomande, 1969; Ferron et al., 1972) that the larvae of Oryctes sp. are selectively susceptible to strains of the major form isolated from insects of the genus Oryctes, the development of the green mus-

cardine fungus in adults was studied in the light of these observations.
Virulence of minor form strains. Eight strains of the minor form, isolated from insects that belong to very different taxonomic groups, Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, were tested. The green muscardine fungi of the minor type which were identified during the 15 wk of this study are given in Table 2. In general, the susceptibility of imagos to infections seemsto be very slight with any of the strains utilized. It is only when a large quantity of spores (1.108 conidia/ml) obtained from only two strains (M.a. No. 41 and M.a. No. 59) was employed that a definite development of mycosis was noted (five and four casesof ten individuals tested). These results, therefore, are analogous to those obtained with
Beauveria bassiana. Virulence of major form strains. The
great majority of the strains studied in this series of experiments differ from the previous ones in that they come from hosts that
belong to only one taxonomic group. The rearing of different species of Oryctes (0. rhinoceros, 0. monoceros, 0. nasicornis, 0. elegans. and 0. boas) at the insectary at La Miniere during recent years has resulted in the isolation of various strains of Metarrhizium. Only two strains of the major type, isolated from another genus of the Scarabaeidae, were used. These were biotypes that came from Cetonia aurata (Cetonidae) and Strataegus aloeus (Dynastidae).
The results (Table 3) indicate a clear variation in the responsesof the adults, depending upon the origin of the Metarrhizium strains. The strains isolated from different
species of Orvctes generally cause a mortality due to mycosis in more than half of insects infected by a pathogenic inoculum with a concentration equal to or higher than 1.106 spores/ml. However, the strain isolated from Strataegus was pathogenic only in concentrations 10 or 100 times greater. The strain isolated from Cetonia was not lethal to Oryctes rhinoceros.
The particular case of strain No. 69 of M. anisopliae. In July 1972, we received from

Wallis Island, in the South Pacific, a sample of Oryctes sp. affected with green muscardine fungus. Isolation of the sample yielded a mixed infection of a minor and major type. These were separated and designated M.a. No. 69A (minor form) and M.a. No. 69B (major form). The virulence of these two strains was studied in larvae as well as in adults of Oryctes rhinoceros (Table 4). The results support the conclusion that the strains of the major type are more pathogenic to Oryctes. A simultaneous infection by the minor form and the major
form, on the larvae as well on adults, with concentrations of inocula varying from 2.10” to 2.10’ spores/ml (at the following mixtures: l.105 spores/ml of M.a. No. 69A + I .lO” spores/ml of M.a. No. 69B, 1.10” spores/ml of M.a. No. 69A + 1.106spores/

ml of M.a. No. 69B, 1.107spores/ml of M.a. No. 69A + 1.107 spores/ml of M.a. No. 69B), did not show a mixed infection by the two strains as was observed with the original sample.
In the absence of supporting data, which would only be possible to obtain as a result of systematic examination of a large number of fleld-collected samples, it is difficult to interpret this particular case. A separate analysis of the specificity of the two strains, M.a. No. 69A and M.a. No. 69B, agrees with the observations made with other
biotypes of these two forms. However, the development of a minor form on an adult initiated investigation into the possibility that a saprophytic development could occur on a cadaver following an accidental infection. It was determined that it was

possible to have a partial development of a minor strain on a cadaver if a very concentrated inoculum of l.108 spores/ml was sprayed on an insect that has been dead for just a few hours. The same infection has no effect when occurring on old cadavers which have probably been invaded by bacterial flora. This is why we consider the sample studied as an individual case does not contradict the results of our laboratory experiments.
CONCLUSION
The experiments on the infection of Oryctes rhinoceros by different species of entomopathogenic fungi (Fungi Imperfecti) confirm their particular susceptibility to the green muscardine disease caused by Metarrhizium anisopliae. As we have already pointed out in a similar study with larvae (Ferron et al., 1972), only the strains of the major type isolated from insects belonging to the genus Oryctes seems to be pathogenic. In the laboratory, about half of the infected insects died by mycosis when the inoculum used reached a concentration of about 1.105 to 1.106 spores/ml. The time necessary to obtain this mortality was 75-80 days. The total mortality caused by mycosis was obtained only with concentrations of about 1.10’ spores/ml. The LT,, could be decreased under optimum conditions to approximatively 35 days.
As we have established in the case of the mycosis caused by Beauveria tenella in Melolontha melolontha (Ferron, 1972), the adults of Oryctes most likely play an important role in the propagation of the

disease. Nevertheless, their susceptibility to the mycosis, which is lesser than that of M. melolontha, probably gives a very limited effect to this phenomenon, which could be determined only by the collection of large samples in their natural biotopes and holding them for a prolonged quarantine period.
Also, it has been observed that the saprophytic development of strains of Metarrhizium of the minor type was possible on cadavers if they had been infected by a very concentrated inoculum of spores and if the cadavers had not already undergone bacterial decomposition.
