The mortality rate- and ~lrc periods of lethal infection are described for the larvae

of Orycles rhinoce,~os inoculated n-ith Rhnbdiowvirus

oryctes. Ground-up

virus-killed

larvae of 0. rhinoceros wxx used to pregnrc the inocula. Similar median lethal dosages

were estimated for the different 1:1r\-al stages and for larvae kept under different condi-

tions of food, temperuturc: and humidity after the inoculation. The period of lethal

infection was found to he dcprndent on the larval stage and on the surrounding

tern-

perature. Storage of Ritdx/i~t~uir~s

in sawdust for 1 week reduced the amount of ae-

tivc virus material in the misturr to 0.091Lib of its initial value. After 2 weeks the

amount of active virus material was reduced to 0.027%, and no more infectivity

was

detectable after 1 month. L)ryAg the mixture or raising the temperature

increased the

rntc of inactivation.

The aicrilization

t’ffect of heat and of several chemicals on the

virus was st udicd.

Rhabdionvirus oryctes ( ROVJ was de-

scribed by Huger (1966a) as a viral patho-

gen of the larvae of the Indian rhinoceros

beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros. The virus was

discovered in Malaya and was found to be

absent in ‘lyestern Samoa (Huger, 1966b).

In 1967 the virus was introduced into Kcst-

ern Samoa as a control agent agnkt Or-

Uctes rhinoceros which is a serious pest of

cwonut palms in this country (Marschall,

1967). The disease became established

rcaclily (Huger, 1969a; 3larrchul1, 1970)

an(l is believed to have caused 3 significant

rctluction of tllc 0. ,hiuorcros l)ol)ul:ttion

The first part of the

stud& described in this paper dealt with

the’ mortality rate and the period of lethal

infection in Oryctes rhkoceY0.s larvae in-

ftB(qed with ROT’. By treating ROT? prepa-

rations in various ways before the inoculation, it. wa.5 al30 investigated how fast, tht

virr1.i; is innrtivatcd

ontside the host and

how it can be sterilized effectively. Preliminary studies of these aspects were done by Huger (1966a, c, 1967).

MATERIAL

AS-D METHODS

Beetles. Oryctes rhinoceros adults were

collected in 1970 in Viti Lcvu (Fiji Islands).

The larvae were reared from eggs in the

laboratory and were fed a mixture of decay-

ing kal)ok wood and co\vdung.

Espe~ri~aentnl

rrzefhotls.

The ROV used

was obtained originally from infected 0.

rhkoceros larvw c.ollectcd in the field in

I\‘wt.crn Samoa and subsequently propa-

gated in tShc laboratory. The remains of

ROY-killed third-instar larvae of 0. rhi-

noceros wrc used as inocula. The inocula

ww prepared from larvae whirl1 had died

rccciitly and had shown the> characteristic

syInptolnS

of the diseabe (we Huger,

1966:~). The larvae wrc ground up in tap

w-ntc>r (larvae : water, 1: 41 with a blender

opcratcd at high speed for 2 minutes. The

nk&urc was then filtcrccl through a cloth.

The resulting suspension containing ROV

was stored in the deep freeze for up to 1

month before use.

Inoculation of the larvae wit,h ROV wts

performed in two different ways: (1) The ROV suspension was diluted with tap water to a given concentration and 0.05 ml of the diluted suspension was injected through the mouth into the esophagus of a paralyzed larva. The dosage was expressed in grams of ROV-killed larvae which were present in the 0.05 ml of the force-fed suspension. The control larvae were force fed with tap water only. After forced feeding, about 10% of the larvae regurgitated some gut fluid. Measurements showed that the amount of regurgitated fluid in general did not exceed half the amount of the force-fed fluid. (2) A second method of inoculation was by maintaining the larvae in mixtures of sawdust and ROV suspension. To prepare the mixtures, the sawdust was dried and the moist’ure was replaced by the diluted ROV suspension. As measurement for the concentration of ROV in the mixture, the percentage by weight of ROV-killed larvae in the mixture was given. The control larvae were maintained in an equivalent mixture of dry sawdust and tap water.
In the study of the inactivation of ROV under different environmental conditions, sawdust mixtures of different concentrations of ROV-killed larvae were stored for various lengths of time under different condit’ions of temperature before inoculation. In general, the mixtures were kept damp during storage, but in one experiment they were placed on trays in a layer 1 cm thick and were allowed to dry out at room temperature (average 26°C). The water lost during drying was Xleplaced before the inoculation.
The effect of heat on ROV was studied by heating the suspension of ROV-killed lar. vae for 10 min at different temperatures before it’ was force fed to the larvae. The effect of chemicals on the virus was tested by mixing the ROV suspension with various concentrations of different chemicals 10 min before inoculation. Here control larvae were iorrc fed with the equivalent concentration of the tested chemical. If an experiment was repeated, different ROV and larval material were used for each replicate.
The larvae were kept individually in tins

covered with cloth. The tins contained either the ROV-sawdust mixtures or, in case of force-fed larvae, the normal larval food (kapok-cowdung mixture). Observations were made twice a week (daily in the case of first-instar larvae). The larvae were exposed by shaking the tins slightly ; neit’her the medium nor the larvae were handled to reduce the risk of cross infection.
dnall~sis. The total mortalit’ies 5 weeks after inoculation were corrected for mortalities in the control group by Abbott’s formula. The median lethal dosages were determined by the maximum likelihood estimation (Finney, 1971). Since the mortalities varied in the different replicates, a separate LDSo value was estimated for each replicate to give some indication of this variation. Averages and standard errors of the LDSO values of the different replicates were based on the logarithms.
The LDBo values were used to compare the susceptibility of the different larval stages to ROV. X measurement for the amount of active ROV remaining after a treatment of the inoculum was obtained by dividing the LDjo value of the untreated inoculum by that of the treated inoculum. Here again, the averages from different replicates and the standard errors were based on the logarit’lims of these estimated values.
All dead control larvae and in many
cases also the dead experimental larrac were bioassayed t)o establish the cause of their deaths. For a bioassay test, a freshly dead test larva was cut into small pieces and mixed with lo-100 g of kapok-row-dung medium, depending on the size of the larva. The mixture was fed to 2 healthy larvae held in one tin (experimental larvae1 while keeping 2 more larvae as controls in a second tin. The result of this feeding test was called ROV-negative, i.e., the death of the original test larva was not caused by ROV, if both experimental larvae survived for 5 weeks or if 1 cxperimcntal larva died but the other survived its deat,h for 5 more weeks. The result, was called ROV-positive. i.e., the original test larva died from ROV, if both experimental larvae died in the first 5 weeks while the cont’rol larvae survived.

This criterion is sufficient since, except for Metar~iziurn anisopliae, which is easily recognizable, no other pathogen of 0. rhinoceros has been found in Western Samoa (Huger, 1966b; Marschall, 1970). In a few cases, a doubtful test result was obtained when mortalities occurred among both the experimental and control larvae or when the experimental larvae died with atypical symptoms. In general, such tests were repcated with the dead experimental larvae as the new test larvae.
The periods of lethal infection were calculated from the time of death of only those larvae which gave a ROV-positive result in tbc fcelling test. Deviations from the median periods of lethal infection were always expressed as standard errors.
RESCLTS
On an average, 5% of the control larvae died in the first 5 weeks after inoculation. With one exception, none of these dead cont,rol larvae gave a ROV-positive result in the feeding test, thus indicating that t,he larval material used in the esperiments was free of ROT:-infections.

ROV-killed larvae force fed per larva (x” = 5.1, 2 d.f.).
In this experiment all larvae were kept until pupation. Except for the highest dosage, all dead larvae were bioassayed in feeding tests. Of all larvae dying from ROV; 94% did so during the first 5 weeks after inoculation and in no case later than 8 weeks (for average periods of lethal infection see below). Pupation of the surviving larvae took place at an average of 19 weeks after the inoculation, and the time of pupation was similar in all experimental groups and in the control group.
First-, second-, and third-instar larvae were kept in sawdust mixtures containing different concentrations of ROV (lOWn, lo-‘, lo-“, and lo-“% ROV-killed larvae). In each of two replicates, 20 larvae were used per concentrat,ion and in the control group (average temperature 27°C). Table 1 gives t’he estimated LD,” concentrations. Although the responses varied considerably between replicates, there was little difference between the LD,, concentrations of the different instare in each replicate and between the average LDeO values. On the other hand, the periods of lethal infection varied significantly (P < 0.01) for the

Different concentrations of ROV in sawdust mixtures were test’ed with third-instar larvae. Twenty larvae were maintained in each concent,ration, and 3 replicates were conducted (average temperature 26”C‘1.

Twenty young third-in&r larvae (2 weeks) and 40 old third-instar larvae (3 months) were force fed with lO-4 g ROVkilled larvae per animal (20 control larvae in each group, average temperature 27OC). No significant difference in mortalities from ROV occurred between both experimental groups (70 and 77%) but the period of lethal infection was significantly (l’ = 0.002) shorter in the young third-instar larvae (17.6 * 1.2 days, N = 14) as compared to the old third-instar larvae (25.0 * 1.3 days, iv = 31).
Three groups of third-instar larvae were force-fed with 10W4 g of ROV-killed larvae

per animal and kept after inoculation under different conditions of food, temperature, or moisture. (Different ROV preparations and different larval material were used in each group.) Table 2 gives details of the experiment, the mortalities1 and the periods of lethal infection. In all three groups the different, conditions did not cause significantly different mortalities from ROV, but in the second group the higher temperature caused a significantly shorter period of lethal infection (P = 0.03).
Inactivation of ROV
Sawdust mixtures were set up with different concentrations of ROV and stored for different lengths of times at ambient temperatures (average 26OC) before inoculation. Table 3 gives the estimated LDSO concentrations of mixtures of different ages. From these LDSO values the percentage of ROV (fresh material = 100%) remaining

weeks: O.lyc and ly<, and in mixtures stored for 1

instar larvae were kept per roncentration,

and

for the determination

of each LDso value, a con-

trol group of 20 larvae were kept.

at different temperatures are given in Table 5. It was estimated from these data that in the tested temperature range, a 1O’C higher storage temperature reduced the amount of active ROV present after 1 week to about one-tenth.
In a similar experiment, ROV-sawdust mixtures were kept dry or damp for 1 week. Besides the controls, the initial concentrations of 0.1% and 1% ROV-killed larvae were used in the test mixtures. Twenty

third-instar larvae were kept per concentration per replicate; the average temperature was 26’C. After drying of the ROVmixture, no mortality occurred in the first replicate and 5% in each concentration of the second replicate. The mixtures that were kept damp gave the normal responses (estimated average LDSO concentration 0.40% ROV-killed larvae in the mixture).
Table 6 gives the mortalities obtained by forced feeding of the larvae with ROV suspensions treated with heat or chemicals.

ROV was inactivated most effectively by applying 7O’C for 10 min and by a 1% solution of formaldehyde or “Dettol” (a commercial germicide).
DISCUSSION
The results described above suggest that t’he mortality of 0. &Gzoceros larvae from ROV is not influencecl significantly by the different developmental stages of the larvae or by different environmental conditions after inoculation. On the other hand, the period of lethal infection depends greatly on the developmental stage of the larvae and is also affected by the surrounding temperature. The observation that the period of let,hal infection is restricted to 8 weeks (pupation took place after 19 weeks) suggests that either ROV infections develop immediately after inoculation or the larvae remain uninfected. Xo evidence was obtained for so called sublethal infections which could cause delayed outbreaks of the disease.
The results indicate that ROV is inactivated rapidly at ambient temperature, thus confirming the earlier work by Huger (1966c, 1967). It can be concluded that ROV-material, even at the highest concentrations, after storage at ambient, temperature for morp than 2 weeks, is not able to infect a significant percentage of the larvae. Drv and hot conditions increase the inactivaiion rate. These results suggest, that ROV material in the form of macerated ROVkilled 0. ~*G~ocero~slarvae is unsuitablr for field release.
The results also show that the inactivation rate is higher in the first week compared with that of the second week of storage. This could mean that some of the ROV particles in the mixture were niorr resistant to denaturation than others.
For sterilizing ROV, heat seems to be most effective. The sterilization experiments wit’b chemicals gave only comparative information for the different chemicals tested. No accuratr sterilization time for a given roncentration of a chemical can be stated from these as the chemical and the ROV could have still reacted with each other in the gut of the larvae aftrr forced feeding.

STUDIES ON RHABDIONVIRUS

241

In the present experiments the inocula presumably containecl ROV particles in various forms. In his initial studies, Huger (1966a1 described two forms of ROV particles, spherical and rod-shaped. He regarded
the spherical particles as early developmental &ages! and the rods as mature forms. Recent studies by Huger (1969b, 1970) have revcalcd that the rod-shaped particles arc sometimes associated with inclusion bodies. ‘I’he inclusion bodies, however, are restricted to a small area of the midgut epi-
thulium and, moreover, can not be demonstrated in every larva infected with ROV.
No st,atement about the proportions of these Mf’ercnt particles in the inocula used in the present experiments can be made, although the percentage of ROV particles in inclusion l&k is apparently low.
