New Immigrant Insects in Hawaii: 1962 through 197612

John W. Beardsley, Jr.
DEPARTMENT OF ENTOMOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII HONOLULU, HAWAII
In December 1961,1 delivered a presidential address before this Society which was titled "On Accidental Immigration and Establishment of Terrestrial Ar thropods in Hawaii During Recent Years" (Beardsley, 1962). In it I reviewed and analyzed accidental insect immigration into Hawaii for the 25 year period of 1937 through 1961. I thought that this time around it might be of interest to review the same subject for the 15 year period since my earlier presentation, and to again analyze our accidental immigrants in an attempt to determine whether or not trends which were indicated in 1961 have continued, and if the inferences which were drawn then have been substantiated.
The data on which these remarks are based are contained largely in the Proceed ings of this Society, mostly in the Notes and Exhibitions sections. The annual lists of new immigrant species contained in the "Proceedings" were a valuable starting point, but they do contain occasional errors and quite a few omissions. Omissions have resulted because not all new immigrant records for Hawaii are reported in the Notes and Exhibitions. Quite a few new records appear only in submitted papers published in the ''Proceedings," or occasionally, in other journals (e.g.: Pacific In sects). I have attempted to include all such records which have come to my atten tion. I would like to urge all of you who either publish or find records of immigrant insects or other terrestrial invertebrates new to Hawaii in other journals to submit notes on these organisms for inclusion in this Society's "Proceedings." By so doing you will help to make a more complete and readily accessible record avail
able for Hawaiian entomologists. It has not always been possible to determine if a published name represented a
new record for Hawaii. For example, a recent paper on Hawaiian Staphylinidae (Moore, 1975) contains a number of names new to Hawaiian literature. Unfortu nately the author did not attempt to relate these names to previously published rec ords of Hawaiian staphylinids. Therefore it was not possible to determine, without expending more time than I could afford, whether these names represented new records or merely name changes for species long established in Hawaii. The clar ification of the status of such names must await more thorough taxonomic reviews of the groups concerned. I have omitted all such doubtful species from considera tion here. Also omitted were records of species collected only once in Hawaii, as well as those records based solely on quarantine interceptions of material presumed to have originated in Hawaii. Records of these sorts may not represent permanently established species. For these reasons, the numbers of new immig rants presented in Table 1 are probably lower than the true totals.

Rate of Accidental Immigration and Establishment
In 19611 calculated that the average rate of accidental introduction and estab lishment of exotic terrestrial arthropods in Hawaii during the period 1937-1961 was approximately 16 species per year. Based upon the published and manuscript rec ords of new introductions during the past 15 years, including those reported today, we have averaged a fraction more than 19 species per year during this period. This indicates a slight increase for the rate during the past 15 years, over that of the prev ious 25 years. The trend toward an increasing rate of accidental introductions seems even more apparent when we examine the actual numbers of immigrants reported during each year of this period (Table 1). During the first 8 years the aver age was almost exactly 16 species per year, or virtually no change from the average of the previous 25 years. However, during the past 7 years (1970 through 1976) an average of 22.6 new exotic species were discovered each year. These figures suggest that during the past few years there has been a definite increase in the rate at which
new immigrants are becoming established.
The taxonomic distribution, by order, of the 287 new immigrants which have been discovered since 1961, is compared in Table 2 with that of the immigrants dis covered during the previous 25 years (1937-1961). As would be expected, it is the larger more advanced orders of insects which continue to account for the great
majority of new accidental introductions.
Returning to the rate of immigration, one question which might be asked about these data is whether they represent an actual increase in the annual rate of acciden tal introduction, or are merely the result of more diligent collecting that has turned up minute and cyptic species which may have been here for many years. I have no doubt that careful collecting by specialists in groups such as scale insects, microhymenoptera, microlepidoptera and acalypterate Diptera has resulted in the dis covery of a number of immigrants in these groups which have long been present in Hawaii. However, it is likely that other such inconspicuous forms have become es tablished during the past 15 years which have not yet been discovered, or at least not
yet identified and reported.
Perhaps a better comparison between the rates of introduction during 1937-61 and 1962-76 could be obtained by comparing those taxonomic groups which contain larger, more obvious insects, and those which are of some direct economic sig nificance. Species in such groups seem most likely to be discovered within a short time after they have become established in Hawaii. In Table 3 I have compared the numbers of immigrants in such conspicuous taxonomic groups which were col-

lected here for the first time during the two time periods under consideration. Spe cies collected here only once and those collected prior to 1937 but not reported until after 1936, have been omitted. It is obvious that if we consider only the taxonomic groups listed, there were nearly as many accidental immigrants which became es tablished during the 15 year period 1962-76, as there were during the previous 25 years; many more than the expected 3/5 ratio. My conclusion, based upon these data, is that the rate of accidental introduction and establishment of exotic insects in Hawaii during the past 15 years has been substantially greater than during the previous 25 years, and that this is particularly true for the past seven years, begin ning in 1970.
Another question which might be raised is whether the present high rate of acci dental introduction of insects into Hawaii represents a permanent trend, or does it merely reflect unusual wartime and immediate postwar conditions associated with the Viet Nam conflict? There was such an upsurge in accidental introductions be ginning the latter part of World War II, and extending through the Korean War to about 1956, when the rate slackened somewhat. Possibly the upsurge in accidental immigrants which has occurred during the past few years is also a temporary one, and perhaps we shall see a decrease in the rate during the next few years. However, I believe that there are still a wide selection of unexploited or underexploited ecolog ical niches in Hawaii, particularly within our man-altered urban, suburban, ag ricultural, and disturbed (exotic) forest ecosystems. There also exist, throughout the tropics and subtropics of the rest of the world, a vast array of insects and related arthropods which have the potential to exploit these niches if and when we provide the opportunity for them to do so. It is well to remember that a single gravid female, if she can find the proper environment for her progeny, may be all that is necessary to establish a new immigrant species in Hawaii. I believe it is quite possible that the arrival of single hitch-hiking females of such large, strong-flying insects as most Macrolepidoptera, for example, can result in the establishment of a species here. Modern jet aircraft with large passenger cabins and cargo holds, and large sealed freight containers, which arrive by both surface and air, probably bring in many such hitchhiking insects which escape detection upon arrival. I believe that we will continue to have an influx of new species in such groups as the noctuid moths, for example, which seem to be well adapted for spread by such means.
I believe, also, that we have ample evidence that new pests are still arriving here on living plant material smuggled into Hawaii from overseas. For example, the six species of Aleyrodidae which have become established here during the past ten years all are associated with ornamental plants or fruit trees, and could hardly have become established here except by being carried in on living plant material.
Origin of Accidental Immigrants In 19611 determined the direction of origin of immigrants in certain taxonomic
groups in which the origin of the species usually could be fixed from published distributional data. The direction of origin was considered as either "east" (i.e.: from the New World), " west" (from elsewhere than the New World, generally from areas of the south and western Pacific, and southeast Asia), or ''undetermined" (cosmopolitan species or those whose origin could not be fixed). It was shown that, for the groups considered, slightly more species had originated from the west than from the New World. In Table 4 the species in these taxonomic groups (plus two additional groups of Macrolepidoptera not previously represented) which arrived here during the period of 1962-1976 are similary analyzed and compared with the 1937-1961 arrivals. These data indicate that in these taxonomic groups there is again

a slight preponderance of species from the west. The conclusion drawn in my ear lier paper, that this is probably due mostly to greater similarities in climate and vegetation between Hawaii and most parts of the western and south Pacific than is the case with most of North America, still appears to be a valid one.
A further question which needs to be addressed is whether it is possible or feasi ble to improve quarantine regulations and their enforcement enough to reduce the rate at which new pests are becoming established in Hawaii. Not all accidental in troductions are pests; many seem to be of little or no consequence, while a few are actually beneficial natural enemies of pests. However, it seems apparent from the list of significant and potentially significant new pests which have arrived here since 1961 (Table 5) that we have continued to receive new pests virtually every year. That no new serious arthropod pests of our two major export crops, sugar and pineapple, have become established here in more than 60 years is indeed fortunate; but how
long will our luck hold? It appears likely that an attempt will be made within the next few years to eradi
cate the three major tephritid fruit fly pest species from Hawaii. Assuming that this project is undertaken and successfully concluded, will it be possible to prevent the reinfestation of the state by one or more of these species from overseas sources? Both the Oriental fruit fly and the melon fly are widespread in tropical and subtrop ical areas of the western Pacific and southeast Asia. Can we successfully prevent gravid female flies or infested fruit from entering Hawaii and re-establishing these species? Unless quarantine enforcement and carrier disinsectization can be con siderably enhanced, I believe that we would stand a good chance of re-infestation
by one or the other of these species within a relatively short time following eradica
tion; say, within ten years.

Two measures which I would recommend to reduce the influx of foreign insect
pests into Hawaii are: 1) the reinstitution of routine thorough disinsectization of all aircraft and freight containers arriving from overseas, and 2) the enhancement of federal and state quarantine regulation enforcement through the provision of addi tional personnel and operations funds. Realistically, in view of the present tight fiscal constraints at both the federal and state levels, as well as the prevailing desire to avoid inconveniencing tourists or shippers in any way lest they take their busi ness elsewhere, I do not foresee either of these recommendations being im
plemented during the immediate future. Therefore, I feel confident that we entomologists can look forward to the contin
ued influx of new immigrant insects into Hawaii. Which species will arrive and when is anybody's guess, but I strongly doubt that we will see any diminution in the rate at which new pests appear in Hawaii during the next several decades. The bright side of the picture, for us at least, is that new pests mean new pest control problems, and a continuing need for entomologists to combat them. Therefore, fellow entomologists, take heart; those pestiferous insects waiting just over the horizon for a trip to Hawaii may be our future job security.
