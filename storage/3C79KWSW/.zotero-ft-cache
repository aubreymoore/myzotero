The Aculeate Hymenoptera of Micronesia I. Scoliidae, Mutillidae, Pompilidae and Sphecidae
By KARL V. KROMBEIN Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine, Agricultural Research
Administration, United States Department of Agriculture (Presented by Mr. Van Zwaluwenburg at the meeting of November 9, 1948)
Prior to World War II the aculeate Hymenoptera fauna of Micronesia had received scant attention. Aside from scattered descriptions of individual species only a few papers have dealt with all the fauna of any island or group of islands. The earliest faunistic paper of any importance is the brief list of Guam Hymen optera by D. T. Fullaway in 1913, which contains thirteen species of bees and wasps, less than half of them being determined to species. The collecting expeditions of the Japanese entomologists, T. Esaki and K. Yasumatsu formed the basis for a series of papers by the latter on the bees and wasps. The bees of the joint Bishop Museum-Japanese Government expedition to the Caroline Islands in 1936 were treated by T. D. A. Cockerell, who also contributed papers on the bees of Guam and Rota Island collected by O. H. Swezey, E. H. Bryan, Jr., and R. L. Usinger. O. H. Swezey also contributed a short paper on the wasps of Guam. A bibliography of the papers dealing with Micronesian wasps is included at the end of this paper.
It is my intention to bring together the information contained in the scattered papers referred to above, as well as to record a number of new endemic species and recently introduced species. The amount of material available for study has been considerably greater than that used by any previous investigator and comes from a wider range of islands.
In spite of this wealth of material, there are still gaps in our knowledge. Several species, are known from only one sex. Prob ably a few endemic species have escaped collection, and undoubt edly additional species will be introduced, intentionally or acci dentally. In a few cases, such as Pison korrorense, the material at hand has been too limited to permit a final decision as to whether the form should be accorded specific or subspecific rank. Almost nothing is known of the habits of the species discussed. Whenever any biological facts have been recorded, even though based on extralimital observations, they have been noted in the discussion of the particular species.
I have assumed that many species were introduced into Micro nesia during the war years owing to the great increase in surface and air shipping during that period. This assumption is supported by positive evidence only with respect to Guam, where there was a good deal of pre-war collecting. Swezey's (1942) list of the Guam wasps included collections through 1936. It is significant that no Sceliphron were taken—two species are now established

on Guam, and it is known that one of them, laetum, accompanied a convoy from the Solomons to Guam in 1945. These are large con spicuous insects, which could not have failed to attract attention if they had been established prior to the war. Other late-comers to Guam not taken in pre-war collections are Tachysphex bengalensis and Motes laboriosus.
Without question the outstanding collection of Micronesian aculeates, considering both the number of individuals and the num ber of species, was that made during the economic survey of Micro nesia by the U. S. Commercial Company from May to August 1946. The entomologists of this expedition, H. K. Townes and R. G. Oakley of the Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine, visited about 20 islands or island groups, and collected on all important groups in Micronesia, with the exception of the northern Marianas and the Gilbert Islands. A total of about 500 bees and wasps was obtained, and the thoroughness of the field work is attested to by the fact that nearly every species previously reported was included, as well as many others, some new and some recently introduced. The number of species represented is extraordinary considering the limited time which was available on most islands.
This material has been supplemented by several smaller lots, some collected by entomologists during their military service in the Pacific, and a post-war collection made by K. L. Maehler, of the Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine. The material ob tained by H. S. Dybas in 1948 in the Palaus and Ponape has not been available, but it is hoped that a study of this can be included as an appendix in Part II of the present paper.
The bees will be treated in Part II, which I hope to complete during the next year. The present section treats all families of wasps known to be present in Micronesia, with the exception of the Vespidae. This family would have been included if J. C. Bequaert had not already made a great deal of progress on his projected monograph of the Vespidae of Oceania. Since duplica tion of effort seemed unnecessary I have turned over to Dr. Bequaert all my material in this particular family.
Keys are presented for the ready identification of the families, . genera and species at present occurring in Micronesia. Any speci
men which fails to agree with the characters ascribed to a particular species, either in the keys or descriptions of new species, should be viewed with some suspicion, since it may belong to endemic or introduced species not included herein.
The synonymy listed under each species includes all references to that species based on material from Micronesia. In introduced species, the original descriptions of all synonyms, where there are any, are given also, even though these references may not have been based on material from Micronesia.
All Micronesian material listed is at present in the United States National Museum, except where specified by abbreviations in brackets following the locality data. Other collections from which

material has been examined and the abbreviations used for each such collection are as follows:
Bernice P. Bishop Museum [BPB] Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association [HSPA] K. V. Krombein, personal collection [KVK] K. L. Maehler, personal collection [KLM]
Wherever possible, duplicates of each species will be deposited in the collection of the B. P. Bishop Museum, Honolulu.
Thanks are due to F. X. Williams for valuable information on Oceanic Pison and the donation of several specimens from the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association. E. C. Zimmerman and R. H. Van Zwaluwenburg have assisted by arranging the loan of specimens from the B. P. Bishop Museum and Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association. K. Yasumatsu has kindly sent a female paratype of his Liris esakii.

It is of interest to note that only the high islands have devel oped endemic species. The low coral atolls have only a sparse, introduced fauna derived mainly from the Oriental region. Com paratively few of the introduced species on any of the islands reached there from the east. The complete distribution of the introduced species is considered in the discussion of each such species.

FAMILY SCOUIDAS
The only endemic scoliid in this area is Campsomeris (Campso meris) ^ palauensis (Turner) of the Palau Islands. Several years ago Campsomeris (Campsomeris) annulata (Fabricius) was lib erated on Guam, Saipan and Rota Islands in the Marianas, where it is now very common and apparently an important factor in the reduction of Anomala sulcatula Burmeister. In 1948 two other scoliids were liberated on the Palaus for control of the rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros (Linnaeus), namely Scolia (Triscolia) patricialis plebeja (Gribodo) from Malaya and Scolia (Scolia) ruficornis Fabricius from Africa.

The four species may be separated by the following key:

1. Forewing with two complete recurrent nervures, both re

ceived by the second submarginal cell (only two sub-

marginal cells) ; mesopleuron sloping gradually from

beneath wing base, without a distinct dorsal surface;

sexual dimorphism marked, the male very slender

synonym.

The extensive yellow maculations in both sexes and ferruginous apical segments of the male abdomen readily distinguish this sole endemic species from introduced species of Scoliidae.
Uchida's form uchiyamai seems to have been based on the typical male, as most specimens before me agree with his brief notes. The only respects in which Uchida's form differs from the descriptions by Turner and Betrem are that the antennae are dark brown be neath (Turner and Betrem mention only that the scape is yellow beneath—all my males have in addition the flagellum brownish beneath), and that there are two spots on the median dorsal area of the propodeum (there is variation in my specimens from those

374
with no markings to those with all intervening gradations of yellow markings).
I have examined the following material: CAROLINE ISLANDS: 4 9 2 , 24 2 S ; Arakabesan Island, Palaus; July 18, 1946 (H. K.

Campsomeris annulata (Fabricius) Townes, 1946. Rpt. 14, U. S. Comm. Co. Surv. Micronesia, p. 48 [common in souttern Marianas].
This species has a wide distribution in Japan, Korea, China, India and the East Indies. In Korea it is parasitic on several species of Anomala and Popillia larvae. Efforts to establish it in eastern North America in 1925 and 1926 for control of Popillia japonica Newman were unsuccessful. It is now extremely abundant in the southern Marianas and appears to be a potent factor in reduction of the Anomala sulcatitla population.
I have examined the following material from Micronesia: MARIANA ISLANDS: 2 $ $ , 3 $ $ ; Point Ritidian, Guam; June 1945 (J. L. Gressitt). 3 $ £ ; same data, but March 7, 1948 (K. L.

Scolia (Scolia) ruficornis Fabricius Scolia ruficornis Fabricius, 1793. Ent. syst. 2 : 230 [ $ ; Senegal; type in Paris (?)]. About 150 specimens of this African species were liberated in
the Palaus in 1948 for control of Oryctes rhinoceros (Linnaeus). No reports have been received yet as to whether the species has become established.
I have included it in the key on the basis of specimens from Africa.
Scolia (Triscolia) patricialis plebeja (Gribodo) Triscolia patricialis var. plebeja Gribodo, 1893. Bui. Soc. Ent. Ital. 25: 168 [ ? , # ; Borneo, Malacca; type in Genoa]. Scolia {Triscolia) patricialis plebeja (Gribodo) Betrem, 1928. Treubia, Suppl. vol. 9: 235. About 100 specimens of this wasp collected by T. R. Gardner
in Malaya were liberated in the Palaus in 1948 for the control of Oryctes rhinoceros. Recently D. B. Langford, Staff Entomologist of the Trust Territory, wrote C. P. Clausen, of the Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine, that he had seen specimens of this wasp in the field several months after liberations, an indica tion that the species is becoming established.
I have not examined specimens of the atypical subspecies plebeja, but have seen two females of the typical subspecies from North Borneo. These females have the head above antennae, scutellum, postscutellum, median dorsal surface of propodeum, median spot on dorsum of first abdominal tergite, and basal band on third tergite, orange. These specimens agree with Betrem's interpretation of patricialis patricialis. Betrem separates patricialis plebeja by the reduction or total absence of yellow markings on the thorax and first abdominal tergite.
FAMILY
Esaki, 1938 (Annot. Zool. Jap. 17: 431-2, fig.) records a female of the New Guinea Timulla (Trogaspidia) albertisi (Andre) from Ashiasu, Peleliu, Palau Islands. I view this determination with a great deal of suspicion, especially since Esaki states (italics mine), "My specimen agrees very well with the description of Andre (1896), except for some details of the pubescence." Females in this genus are very difficult to determine, and separation depends in many cases on seemingly minute differences in the pubescence. Unfortunately Esaki does not mention what these differences are. Even though the wingless females in this genus are frequently carried in flight by the males during mating, I regard it as extremely

376

unlikely that the New Guinea species could become established in the Palaus in this way. In all probability the Palau form represents a discrete new species, but lacking material I am unable to carry the matter any further. Esaki has assigned the species to the cor rect genus, as his photograph is unmistakably that of a Tiinulla.
The female may be readily recognized by being wingless, about 10 mm. long, black with a pair of oval spots on the second abdominal tergite and a broad transverse band on the third tergite, both of pale, appressed pubescence. The male is unknown, but males of this genus are winged, have reniform compound eyes, large tegulae, and a sessile first abdominal segment.

FAMILY POMPIUDAE
These wasps, popularly known as spider wasps from their habit of provisioning the cells for the young with paralyzed spiders, are poorly represented in Micronesia. Apparently the only endemic species is the new Bpisyron from the Palaus described below. In addition, there is the oceanic vagrant, Anoplius opulentus (Smith), which became established during and after the war in the Marianas and Palaus, and an Auplopus (olim Pseudagenia) probably intro duced on Guam (my single specimen is in too poor condition for specific identification).

The three specimens before me may be separated by the follow ing key:

1. Subdiscoidal vein of forewing meeting discoidal vein at a

right angle so that third discoidal cell does not have a

pocket at base. $ $ : Second abdominal sternite with a

deep transverse groove before middle; pygidium a flat

tened, oval, shining or shagreened area. $ $ : First ab

dominal segment very slender and elongate, in length

somewhat over four times the width at base; Marianas

(Guam)

Auplopus species (p. 377)

Subdiscoidal vein of forewing abruptly angulate at base and

meeting discoidal vein at an acute angle so that the third

discoidal cell has a distinct pocket at base. $ $ : Second

abdominal sternite without a transverse groove; pygidial

area not delimited, the last tergite uniformly convex and

clothed with erect bristles. $ $ : First abdominal seg

ment much broader, its length not over three times the

width at base

2

2. Pale integumental maculations lacking except on seventh

tergite of male, the entire body strikingly ornamented

with numerous spots of appressed silvery pubescence,

none of pubescence consisting of modified scale-like

setae; wings dusky, the tips darker; apical margin of cly-

peus subtruncate on middle two-thirds, mandibles not

hidden by clypeus when head is viewed from in front.

$ $ : Tarsal claws not cleft, but with a small erect tooth

at middle. $ $ : Fourth abdominal sternite slightly con-

377

cave, covered with dense, suberect hairs having kinky

tips; hypopygium tectiform; Marianas, Carolines (Pa-

laus)

Anoplius opulentus (Smith) (p. 377)

Clypeus, face, occiput, pronotum, hind tibia and second

and third abdominal tergites with ivory integumental

maculations; some pubescence on pronotum, postscu-

tellum, propodeum, first abdominal segment (and base

of second also in male) dense, appressed and scale-like;

wings clear hyaline, tips dusky; apical margin of cly

peus broadly rounded, mandibles almost completely

hidden by clypeus when head is viewed from in front.

$ 9 : Tarsal claws cleft. $ $ : Fourth abdominal ster-

nite convex, without differentiated hairs; hypopygium

slightly convex; Carolines (Palaus)

Episyron maehleri, new species (p. 378)

Auplopus species
I place here a single male from Point Oca, Guam; May 1945 (G. E. Bohart and J. L. Gressitt). The specimen is in deplorable condition, apparently having been mashed between the cork and lip of the collecting -bottle, since the head is broken and most of the antennae and legs are missing. It is, however, recognizable as an Auplopus (olim Pseudagenia), because of the slender first abdominal segment and lack of a pocket at the base of the third discoidal cell of the forewing. I suppose it is an introduced species, as it was not taken on any of the earlier Guam surveys, but I am unable to match it with any of the available Philippine or North American species in the National Museum collection. However, males of only a few of the Philippine species are known.

Apparently the nesting habits of this wasp are such that it has been readily transported by commerce in the past, and with the advent of air travel the adults themselves are probably being transferred to new localities. It seems likely that this species came originally from the East Indies and reached by successive steps New Guinea, Australia and the Solomon Islands. The colonies in the Palaus and Marianas reported below seem to have been estab lished by air transport during the war, in part at least, for H. K. Townes informs me that specimens were found most commonly in the vicinity of airfields.
The new synonymy listed above is based almost entirely on the original descriptions. The pattern of silvery pubescence is quite striking, and is mentioned by each of the authors. At my request H. K. Townes kindly made notes on the male allotype of Anopli nellus minor Banks at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College which further confirmed my suspicion as to the identity of that species.
I have seen specimens from New Caledonia, New Guinea and the Solomons, in addition to those from Micronesia listed below:

Psammocharidae sp. Townes, 1946. Rept. 14, U. S. Comm. Co. Surv. Micronesia, p. 50 [Palaus].
The present species seems closest to the Bombay, India, decoratus (Smith), and may be identical with the female recorded as decoratus from Formosa by Yasumatsu, 1937 (Mushi 10: 72). Female's of both species agree in being more or less shining, and in having the clypeus broadly rounded apically and the short

tarsal comb. However, they differ in several details of coloration which seem of specific importance. Thus, decoratus is essentially a more extensively maculated species, having ivory maculations along the inner and outer eye margins, posterior margin of pronotum, posteriorly on the mesoscutum, on the mesopleuron below the wing base, at base of hind tibia, a pair of lateral spots on the sec ond and third abdominal tergites, and a fascia at the base of the fifth tergite, but the clypeus is entirely black; maehleri is much less extensively maculated with ivory, lacking spots on the meso scutum, mesopleuron and fifth tergite, but the third tergite has a broad fascia instead of lateral spots, and the clypeus is entirely pale except for the narrow apical margin and a quadrate mark at the base. The scutellum in maehleri is very prominently gibbose and the interocellar area is flat; these characters are not mentioned in the descriptions of decoratus. B. maehleri is distinguished from any of the known Philippine species by the combination of char acters listed above.

This species has a wide distribution in the Palaearctic, Ethio pian, Oriental and Australian regions, and has become established just recently in Hawaii (Weber, 1948. Proc. Hawaii. Ent. Soc. 13: 205; first captured in Hawaii in 1947). D. G. Hall informs me that he found the species to be relatively common on Tarawa in the Gilbert Islands in 1945, so perhaps the first migrants to Hawaii came from that particular population. Presumably the species was established on Tarawa during the Japanese occupa tion either from Japan or the Philippines.
Home, 1870 (Trans. Zool. Soc. London 7: 163-4, pi. 21, figs. 2, 2a), notes that this species in India constructs one or more clay cells which are provisioned with small spiders.

This species is readily distinguished from all known species of the genus by the combination of the hind coxa being rectangulate at the base on the outer margin and the apical segments of the abdomen being yellow.
The colonies on Guam and the Palaus almost certainly were

established during the war years by military traffic from the Solo mons, and perhaps New Guinea. Several years ago G. E. Bohart informed me that specimens of this species accompanied the ship on which he sailed from the Solomons to Guam early in 1945.
This and the following two species build clay cells which they provision with small spiders.

This and the following species belong in the group having the hind coxa rounded at base on outer margin as contrasted with the group exemplified by the preceding species in which this coxa is rectangulate at base on outer margin. Although madraspatanum is closely related to caementarium, the two are easily separated by the characters noted in the key.
I assume this species was introduced recently to the Palaus from the Philippines, for Yasumatsu does not record it from pre-war material from the Palaus.

Lestica (Solenius) constricta, new species Crabro (Ceratocolus) quadriceps Bingham, Yasumatsu, 1939. Mushi 12: 153, pi. 6, figs. 1-4 [ $ ; Babelthuap Island, Palaus; misidentification]. Crabro quadriceps Bingham, Townes, 1946. Rpt. 14, U. S. Comm. Co. Surv. Micronesia, p. 51 [common in the Palaus].
Yasumatsu's description and figures agree in all essential re spects with the series of males before me. There is, likewise, no doubt that the present species is distinct from the true quadriceps of Binghamr There are too many points of difference, in both sculpture and color, between Bingham's description of the female quadriceps and my Series of three females of the present species. Furthermore, quadriceps has been placed in the synonymy of the widely distributed alata (Panzer), questionably by Kohl, 1915 (Ann. k. k. Naturhist. Hofmus. Wien 29: 125), and definitely by Turner, 1912 (Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist. [8] 10: 376), a species which belongs to the typical subgenus rather than to Solenius,
Later, Yasumatsu, 1942 (Mushi 14: 90), recorded additional material of both sexes of quadriceps from China and Formosa. If these latter specimens are conspecific with Palau material, and I have no reason to doubt Yasumatsu's placing them together, constricta has a fairly extended range and probably will be found also in the Philippines. Therefore, the possibility exists that the species is not endemic in the Palaus, but was introduced perhaps from Formosa or the Philippines.
The present species appears to be most closely related to Lestica (Solenius) wolhnanni (Kohl), new combination, from Turkestan (Kohl, 1915. Ann. k. k. Naturhist. Hofmus. Wien 29: 121 [ g ; described as Crabro (Ceratocolus)]), agreeing with that species in the very strongly constricted abdominal segments. The male described as the opposite sex of wolhnanni by Kuznetzov-Ugamskij, 1927 (Zool. Anz. 71: 244; [ $ ; Berkara, 70 km. west of Aulie-Ata in central Asia]), may be incorrectly associated, since it appears to belong to the subgenus Clypeocrabro. However, the distinctions between Clypeocrabro and Solenius seem difficult to maintain.
The female of constricta differs in having the postscutellum black (yellow in wolhnanni) and the abdominal tergites one to five each with a pair of yellow spots, those of one, two and five being very narrowly separated in the middle (wolhnanni has bands on one, four and five, lateral spots on two and three). Kohl mentions that the punctation of the abdominal tergites in wollmanni is sparser than in clypeata (Schreber), whereas the punc tation in constricta is extremely close, much more so than in clypeata. Kohl does not mention the hind margins of the first five abdominal tergites in zvolhnanni, so I assume they are not reflexed in that species, whereas they are in constricta. The male which Kuznetzov-Ugamskij associates with zvolhnanni is at once

390
separated from the male of constricta by having the median flagellar segments longer than broad (about as long as broad in con stricta) and in having the head much more narrowed behind the compound eyes, much as in clypeata.
Nothing is known of the habits of this species, but other mem bers of the subgenus nest in stems of pithy plants or in old beetle borings and provision their nests with adult Diptera or Lepidop-
tera.

Rhopalum (?) sp. Townes, 1946. Rpt. 14, U. S. Comm. Co. Surv. Micronesia, p. 51 [common in the Palaus].
The combination of the rather short petiole of first abdominal segment, transverse carina margining the facial concavity above, and the total absence of yellow maculations on body and append ages serves to separate immaculatus from the other known species of this genus. It is not at all closely related to Dasyproctus philippinensis Ashmead, its closest geographical relative, which has
coarse punctures on upper part of front and vertex, a longer, more slender first abdominal segment, and extensive yellow maculations on body and appendages.
Nothing is known of the ethology of this species, but other mem bers of the genus nest in flower stalks or old beetle borings, and provision them with adult Diptera.

The present species is widely distributed in the Oriental region and recently has become established in Hawaii (Weber, 1948. Proc. Hawaii. Ent. Soc. 13 : 203—erroneously reported as bituberculatus Cameron). The populations in the Palaus, Marianas and Hawaii probably originated from specimens introduced from the Philip pines.
The habits of this species are unknown, but other members of the genus construct shallow burrows, usually in sandy soil, which they provision with Orthoptera.

Dicranorhina species
F. X. Williams informs me that he observed several specimens belonging to this genus running in a characteristic high-legged fashion near his quarters while in the Palaus in June 1948. He describes the manner of running (1928. Bui. 19, Ent. Ser., Expt. Sta. Hawaii. Sugar PL Assoc, p. 100) in luzonensis Rohwer as "a peculiar easy gait, the fore part of the body being raised con siderably higher than the posterior." It is unlikely that an endemic species would have escaped capture by the several expeditions which visited the Palaus from 1936 to 1946 because of the semidomiciliary habits of the known species, so it seems probable that the species seen by Williams is a recent introduction to the Palaus, perhaps luzonensis Rohwer.

This common and widely distributed Oriental species was intro duced into Hawaii from the Philippines over 25 years ago. Pre sumably the Marshall Islands population arose from specimens accidentally introduced there from Hawaii.

Motes townesi,6 new species Motes sp. Townes, 1946. Rpt. 14, U. S. Comm. Co. Surv. Micro nesia, p. 50 [Palaus].
The present species belongs to the difficult complex containing manilae (Ashmead), tristis (Smith), sainoensis (Williams), bakeri (Williams), ligulata (Williams) and others. It is at orice separable from all of them by the extremely sparse thoracic punctation. Apparently it is closest to sainoensis, which differs in the male in genitalic features and shorter basal flagellar segments, in the female in the lack of silvery bands on abdomen, and in both sexes in the denser punctation of the thorax. Like samoensis, townesi is larger ( <j> , 9.2 mm.; $ , 8.5 mm.) than the ubiquitous manilae ( $ , 6.5-8.3 mm.; $ , 5.0-6.5 mm.).

This handsome wasp is widely distributed in the Ethiopian and Oriental regions and has become established on many of the Pacific islands including Hawaii (Weber, 1947. Proc. Hawaii. Ent. Soc. 13: 22). Richards, 1935 (Trans. Roy. Ent. Soc. London 83: 164), has pointed out that the Fabrician Sphex aurata was pre occupied by Linnaeus, and that the Fabrician species probably should be known as opulenta (Lepeletier). It has been recorded as nesting in the soil and storing large crickets (Gryllidae).

This species is readily distinguished from the other Micronesian Liris by the combination of the strongly infumated wings, the sparser punctation of the mesoscutum, the radiating carinae on the dorsum of the propodeum, the dark brown pile on the female pygidium, and the almost total lack of carinae on the lateral surface of the propodeum of the male. Yasumatsu shows the male clypeus as having the margin of the produced part shallowly concave and without a central notch. My two males have a central notch, and the margin is subtruncate in one, and convex on each side of the central notch in the other, so there is considerable variation in this character.

Yasumatsu records a single male from Ponape as this species. He states that the occipital carina is angulate lateroventrally instead
of rounded as in other species of the genus. The Ponape "specimen
was not compared with Samoan material, and there is some pos sibility that the Ponape form is at least subspecifically distinct. The female of the Samoan form has the pygidial pile pale golden, which readily distinguishes it from the closely related esakii and williamsi which have dark brown pile on the pygidium. I have seen no material from Ponape, and the species is included in the key on the basis of a pair of paratypes made available by E. C. Zimmerman and R. H. Van Zwaluwenburg.
Liris williamsi,7 new species The present species is most closely related to esakii Yasumatsu.
In addition to the hyaline wings and weaker oblique carinae on the dorsum of the propodeum, williamsi is separated from esakii by the relatively denser punctation of the mesoscutum and the better developed shoulder below the lateral angle of the produced part of the clypeus. This species is endemic in the Palaus.

clypeus and lower half of front, sparser and appressed on thorax, legs and abdomen, the thorax in addition with some longer, suberect hairs, first three abdominal tergites with a short, narrow strip of appressed silvery pubescence laterally at apex; pygidium with dense, short, appressed dark brown hairs, and a few suberect bristles. Wings hyaline and with iridescent reflections, the apices slightly infuscated, nervures black.
Head: Clypeus punctate almost to apical margin, the latter with a narrow median notch, and a small shoulder at lateral angle of produced part, the margin between notch and shoulder slightly convex, the apical third of clypeus shining and with larger punctures than the basal two-thirds which is dull from close, fine punctation; first and second flagellar segments subequal in length, the least interocular distance on vertex 1.13 times the length of the first flagellar segment.
Thorax: Mesoscutum with moderately large punctures, anteriorly somewhat closer than on the posterior three-fourths where they are separated by about the width of a puncture; scutellum with smaller punctures separated by about twice the width of a puncture; postscutellum more finely and rather closely punctate; mesopleuron shagreened; dorsal surface of propodeum with a welldefined shallow central sulcus which encloses a carina on basal half, else where with weak, irregular oblique carinae; side of propodeum with a few oblique carinae on anterior half; posterior surface of propodeum with a nar row, impressed median line, above with a couple irregular transverse carinae, elsewhere scabrous.
Abdomen: Pygidium with sides slightly convex, the basal width about three-fifths the length.
Wings: Relative lengths of abscissae of marginal cell of forewing about 9:3:5:11:2.
Paratype: $ ; Koror, Palau Islands; March 15-25, 1948 (K. L. Maehler; in field). It is 10.5 mm. long and differs from the type in lacking a central carina on basal half of dorsum of propodeum. The paratype will be deposited in the B. P. Bishop Museum, Hono lulu.
Liris (?) mindanaoensis carolinensis Yasumatsu Liris mindanaoensis carolinensis Yasumatsu, 1941. Mushi 14: 46, pi. 1, fig. 5 [ $ ; Tol Island, Truk Atoll; type in Fukuoka, Japan].
I have had to omit this form from the key because of lack of material and a suspicion that it may be placed in the incorrect genus. The measurements given by Yasumatsu (length: head 2.5 mm.; forewing 2.0 mm.; hind wing 1.5 mm. Width: head 1.5 mm.; thorax 2.0 mm.; abdomen 1.5 mm.) indicate a larrine wasp much smaller than any I have seen from Micronesia. Even the tiniest male Motes manilae (body length 5.0 mm.) known to me has a forewing 4.0 mm. in length. The known species of Liris are all much larger, no Micronesian males being less than 7.0 mm. long (forewing 6.0 mm.). Certainly if carolinensis is a true Liris it is specifically distinct from mindanaoensis which is almost as large as opulenta.

This species, which nests in abandoned beetle borings in Euphorbia in Hawaii and provisions the nests with nymphs of Nysius (Lygaeidae), is apparently a recent migrant to the Marshalls. In the discussion accompanying the original description Bridwell suggests that the species may have been introduced into Hawaii, possibly from Central America. Krauss, 1945 (Proc. Hawaii. Ent. Soc. 12: 317), made the above generic transfer.

The species constructs either free clay cells or partitions holes in timber and provisions the cells with small spiders.

The strongly infumated wings and erect black hairs on head and thorax readily separate this handsome wasp, endemic in the Marianas, from all others in Micronesia. Peculiarly enough the male is still unknown, though it should be easily recognized, since it probably has the same characters of coloration and pubescence. The species is rare in collections and I suspect must be a sylvicolous species.

Type: $ ; near hydroelectric plant, Colonia, Ponape; August 9, 1946 (H. K. Townes; along roads, stream banks and bottomland native vegetation). [U. S. National Museum, Type No. 59039.]
Female—Length 8.0 mm., forewing 6.2 mm. Black, head opaque, thorax and abdomen shining; mandible castaneous near tip. Erect vestiture short, black, moderately dense on head and thorax, very sparse on abdomen; clypeus and lower half of front with appressed, short, dense silvery pubescence, abdomen with much sparser, shorter appressed silvery hairs and without apical hair-bands; tibial calcaria black. Wings hyaline and with iridescent reflections, stigma and veins black.
Head: Clypeal lobe impunctate, more or less pentagonal in outline, about one-third the greatest width of clypeus; front finely granulate and with superimposed small, shallow punctures mostly separated by somewhat more than the diameter of a puncture; an evanescent longitudinal groove running from anterior ocellus half the distance toward antennal insertions and ter minating in a short polished streak; vertex about as finely punctate as front, but the punctures separated by about the diameter of a puncture; shortest distance between eyes at lower ends (across middle of clypeus) 2.2 times the shortest interocular distance on vertex; ocellocular distance one-sixth the diameter of a posterior ocellus and one-fourth the postocellar distance; ratio of lengths of first three segments of flagellum about 13:12:12; least inter ocular distance on vertex equal to length of first flagellar segment.
Thorax: Mesoscutum with punctures equal in size to those on front, an teriorly separated by about the diameter of a puncture, posteriorly by more than the diameter of a puncture; scutellum and postscutellum with finer, more separated punctures; mesopleuron with punctures equal in size to those on mesoscutum, usually separated by somewhat more than the diameter of a puncture; metapleuron with minute punctures, ttiose on upper third closer together; dorsum of propodeum with sparse, minute punctures, a few very short radiating carinae at base, the median longitudinal carina weak, ex tending over anterior half only, contained in a very shallow sulcus which is deeper posteriorly; lateral surface of propodeum with minute punctures which are closer than on dorsum, no carina separating lateral from dorsal and posterior surfaces; the latter with the usual deep impression in middle, some scattered fine punctures and above insertion of muscle a few short, transverse carinae interrupted at midline.
Abdomen: Tergites with minute scattered punctures, the first five very slightly constricted at apex; second sternite practically impunctate.
Wings: Forewing with petiole of second submarginal cell 1.4 times the height of cell; first recurrent vein interstitial with first transverse cubital vein, the second slightly distad of the second transverse cubital.
Female paratypes vary in length from 7.0 to 8.5 mm., and differ from the above description in no important details, except that occasionally the first recurrent vein in the forewing is received proximad of the first transverse cubital vein.
Allotype: $ : Ponape; March 14, 1936 (Z. Ono). [B. P. Bishop Museum.]
Male. Length 72 mm., forewing 5.4 mm. Similar to the type in color, vestiture and sculptural characters with the following exceptions.
Head: Clypeal lobe pentagonal in shape, but the apex more narrowly rounded; shortest distance between eyes at lower ends (across middle of

403
clypeus) 1.7 times the shortest interocular distance on vertex: ocellocular distance about one-third the diameter of a posterior ocellus and one-half the postocellar distance; least interocular distance on vertex about 1.5 times the length of the first flagellar segment.
Thorax: Punctation correspondingly somewhat sparser than in female. Abdomen: Third sternite without a median tubercle or ridge; second to fifth sternites with low, rounded, transverse, posterolateral ridges, those of third the longest and strongest, those of fifth very short; hypopygium with surface flat, clothed with stout bristles on exposed part, the apical margin
truncate.
Wings: First recurrent vein slightly proximad of first transverse cubital vein, second recurrent slightly distad of second transverse cubital.

The present species and ignavum Turner are easily distinguished from other Pison occurring in Micronesia by the pale tibial calcaria, extremely dense silvery pubescence and the second recurrent vein
being received in the 'middle of the second submarginal cell. P. argentatum is smaller (aver, length, $-6 mm., $-5 mm.) than
ignavum (aver, length, $-8 mm., #-7 mm.), the punctation is finer though equally dense, the apical margin of the clypeal lobe is not depressed in the middle in the female, and the oblique carinae on the dorsum of the propodeum are weaker and tend to become evanescent toward the margins. The present species is more widely distributed than any other Pison, occurring in the Ethiopian and Oriental regions, and on various Pacific islands east to Hawaii. It constructs free clay cells in sheltered situations which it provisions with small spiders.

Like the latter, it builds free clay cells in sheltered situations which it provisions with small spiders.

The comparatively large size, triangular clypeal lobe, and dense punctation of mesopleuron and second abdominal sternite distin guish the present species from others occurring in Micronesia. The Marshall Islands populations may have arisen from migrants from Hawaii. The species was present in the Palaus as early as 1936.
Yasumatsu's description and figures of what he calls fuscipennis Smith agree with specimens of the present species. The species does run to fuscipennis in Turner's table to the Australian species (1916, Proc. Zool. Soc. London, pp. 595-599), but hospes is not included in that key. Since Turner apparently knew both species and treated them as distinct I shall follow him. Turner does mention (loc. cit.) that hospes "is doubtfully distinct from P. pallidipalpis Smith." The latter name has precedence if the two are conspecific.

Apparently this is a recent introduction to Micronesia. Previously it was known from the Fijis, Samoa, Society Islands, Ellice Islands and the Marquesas. Its closest relatives in Micronesia are hospes and ponape, from which it may be distinguished by a combination of the infumated wings, well-developed median carina on dorsum of propodeum, and the sculpture of the posterior surface of the propodeum and second abdominal sternite.
MARSHALL ISLANDS: 1 9 ; Bigatyelang Island, Ailinglapalap Atoll; August 25, 1946 (H. K. Townes).
Pison ponape, new species The present species, known from the female only, forms with
hospes and tahitense a group rather well segregated from the other Micronesian species. The group is distinguished by the subcontiguous punctation of mesopleuron, lack of oblique carinae on dorsum of propodeum, unmodified third abdominal sternite of males, and the rather large size, females averaging over 9 mm. in length and the known males over 8 mm. In addition to the characters listed in the key as distinguishing ponape from hospes and tahitense, it has a prominent apical band of silvery pubescence on only the first tergite, whereas the latter two species have such bands on the first four tergites in the females.
Like nigellwm, ponape appears to be an endemic species on Po nape and is found in areas of native vegetation.

form from the closely related iridipenne and korrorense. Like the other endemic Micronesian Pison, ponape, nigellum, and esakii, this is an inhabitant of the native forests.
Type: $ ; Point Ritidian, Guam; June 1945 (J. L. Gressitt). [U. S. National Museum, Type No. 59041.]
Male. Length 6.1 mm., forewing 4.9 mm. Black, shining except head opaque; mandible at tip castaneous. Vestiture sparse, silvery, shining, less noticeable than in iridipenne, decumbent on head, legs and abdomen, suberect on thorax, the apical bands on first to fourth tergites narrower and not so dense as in iridipenne; tibial calcaria black. Wings strongly infumated with brown and with violaceous reflections, stigma and veins fuscous.
Head: Impunctate clypeal lobe a low triangle in outline; shortest distance between eyes at lower ends (across middle of clypeus) greater than shortest interocular distance on vertex (5.75:4) ; front granulate and with numerous small, shallow, subcontiguous punctures, the interspaces not so close as to form a network of fine carinae as in korrorense; frontal groove present but weak, running from anterior ocellus half the distance toward antennal inser tions and terminating in a short carina; punctures of vertex slightly finer than on front, and separated by about the width of a puncture; postocellar distance about twice the ocellocular distance and three-fifths the diameter of a posterior ocellus; relative lengths of first three flagellar segments about 10:9:8; shortest interocular distance on vertex very slightly more than the first and second flagellar segments combined.
Thorax: Mesoscutum about as finely and sparsely punctate as vertex, the scutellum and postscutellum equally finely punctate, the latter more sparsely so; mesopleuron with punctures slightly larger than on mesoscutum, usually separated by about the width of a puncture; metapleuron minutely punctate, the upper third more densely so; lateral surface of propodeum separated from dorsal and posterior surfaces by a carina extending almost from the apex of the segment to a point on the dorsal surface halfway to the spiracle; dorsum of propodeum with median carina weak, present only on anterior half, the sulcus also weak but extending to apex, remainder of surface with sparse, delicate punctures separated by several times the width of a puncture (much sparser than in iridipenne) and without traces of oblique, discal carinae; lateral surface with slightly larger and much denser punctures; posterior surface with the usual median impression, the upper half with sparse, small punctures, the lower half with a few transverse rugae.
Abdomen: Tergites one to five slightly constricted at apices and with delicate punctures separated by several times the width of a puncture; sternites with the second somewhat more sparsely punctate than the second tergite, the' succeeding sternites progressively more densely punctate than the second; third sternite with a small, low rounded tubercle on midline at about the basal third; hypopygium with a rounded impression near the apex, the apical margin broadly and very shallowly emarginate.
Wings: Forewing with petiole of second sumarginal cell subequal to height of cell; first and second recurrent veins interstitial with first and second transverse cubital veins.
Male paratypes vary in length from 5.6 to 6.8 mm. and the first recurrent vein of forewing is proximad of first transverse cubital vein in two specimens.
Allotype: $ ; Mt. Alutom, Guam; June 18, 1946 (H. K. Townes). [U. S. National Museum.]
Female. Length 8.1 mm., forewing 6.1 mm. Similar to type male except as follows: Clypeal lobe with apical margin broadly rounded; shortest dis tance between eyes at lower ends (across middle of clypeus) 2.3 times the

least interocular distance on vertex; postocellar distance about one-third the diameter of a posterior ocellus; relative lengths of first three flagellar seg ments about 6:5:5; the shortest interocular distance on vertex slightly more than the length of first flagellar segment; third abdominal sternite not tuberculate.
Paratype females show some variation in the details of venation, occasionally the first recurrent vein being received proximad of the first transverse cubital vein, or the second recurrent distad of the second transverse cubital. The two females from Rota Island have less strongly infumated wings, but are otherwise identical. Addi tional material from Rota may establish the presence of a distinct subspecies on that island. Paratype females vary in length from 7.0 to 8.1 mm.

Typical iridipenne apparently occurs only in the Fijis, Samoa, Society Islands, Tuamotus, Hawaii, and the localities in Micronesia listed below. Williams, 1947 (Occ. Papers B. P. Bishop Mus. 18: 331), states that it has been recorded also from Australia, but I can find no other published record to this effect. Specimens from the Philippines are not typical iridipenne. It is a member of an exceedingly difficult assemblage of closely related species or sub species of which females seem almost identical. The males of this group differ especially in the character of the third abdominal ster nite, some having it unarmed, others having a median tubercle, a pair of tubercles, or a short transverse ridge. I suspect that ade quate populations may show that many of the forms now considered as species, such as korrorense Yasumatsu, may have to be reduced to subspecific rank.

This species has been recorded as nesting in holes in timber, or partitioning clay cells of Sceliphron. The cells are provisioned with small spiders.

As stated under the discussion of iridipenne, the present species may eventually have to be treated as a subspecies of the former when adequate material is at hand. I have seen only one female of this complex from the Palaus (Peleliu Island), and it appears to be identical with typical iridipenne. Yasumatsu's description of the female of korrorense offers no points of distinction between it and iridipenne. The male is quite distinct from iridipenne in the bituberculate third abdominal sternite and punctation of front. I am unable to say whether the latter character is the same in the female. My male of korrorense also has the dorsum of the propodeum entirely without oblique discal carinae, but since their development is subject to some variation in iridipenne, though seemingly always present to some extent, I have not attempted to use it as a key character. Judging from Yasumatsu's description of the female, the dorsum of the propodeum is the same as in my male.
