INTRODUCTION

AND HISTORICAL

OVERVIEW

Palms are important crops in the tropics. The coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) produces nuts whichmaybe used directly for food, or the contained copra maybe crushed to yield coconut oil. The oil palm (Elais guineensis) produces bunchesof fruits that yield both palmoil and kernel oil, and the product of the date palm(Phoenix dactylifera) is well known.The Rhinoceros beetles (Scarabaeidae, Dynastinae) are important pests of palms. Attacks by adults may reduce yield, kill both seedlings and young and old palms, and discourage replanting. Theymayprovide entry points for lethal secondary attacks by the palmweevil Rhynchophorusin somecountries or by pathogens. The breeding sites in which the immaturestages develop are widespread, abundant, and often difficult to removeor destroy. The main pest species are membersof the genus Oryctes, particularly O. rhinoceros [which caused damageestimated as at least 5US1,100,000 to South Pacific countries in 1968 alone (20)], O. monoceros, and O. boas; subspecies of Scapanesaustralis," and species of Strategus.
Muchof the earlier workwas reviewed by Gressitt (56), and this review emphasizes developments since then, although reference is made to the earlier studies whereappropriate. Integrated pest control (in the sense of using several compatible control methods simultaneously in an effort to reduce pest numbersto a subeconomiclevel) was attempted for decades. However,results were frequently unsatisfactory or disappointing, and control was often affected by the economicsof, and local attitudes towards, the

crop. The vigor of application of the methods often fluctuated with the changingmarket value of the crop, and it wasdifficult to have the control measures carried out uniformly by all sectors of the communities concerned. Onlyin recent years has the developmentof newmeasures, such as the use of baculovirus and cover crops, added highly effective and practicable componentsto integrated control programs.
TAXONOMIC STUDIES
Thirty-nine species of Oryctes were recognized in a recent comprehensive study (37, 38). Of these, 11 species are endemicin Madagascarand 5 in the Comores(139), 3 in Mauritius (176), and several in Africa (44, 45). subspecies of Scapanesaustralis have been recognized (35, 39). Twocomprehensive revisions of Strategus have recently appeared: Endr/Sdi (40) recognized 25 species and illustrated malegenitalia; Ratcliffe (152) recognized 31 extant species and gave distribution maps, photographs, and male genitalia illustrations for all species. The taxonomyof the following minor pests has recently been revised: Xylotrupes gideon (16 subspecies) (41), Chalcosoma,spp. including C. atlas (41), Trichogomphus(9 species) (39), and Papuanaspp. (36). The larvae are far less well knownand only the following have been described according to Ritcher’s method(154): O. boas (129), O. gigas (130), O. monoceros(16), O. rhinoceros, three subspecies of S. australis, Trichogomphufas irrnairei ( = T. excavatus), X.. gideon (6), and C. atlas (12).

DISTRIBUTION

AND SPREAD TO NEW AREAS

O. rhinoceros is endemicto the coconut growingregions of Asia (20) from west Pakistan, through India, the Maldive Islands, Ceylon, Hainan, Taiwan, Hongkong, Thailand, Vietnam (171), the Malayan Peninsula, the
islands of Java, Sumatra, Bali, Lombok,Kalimantan, Celebes, Ceram, and Amboinain Indonesia (191), to the Philippine Islands. In Burmathe pest first appeared in the extreme south of the peninsula. It probably entered from Malaysia about 1895 and worked its waynorth throughout the coconut growingareas of lower Burmaover the following 15 years (114). It was accidentally introduced to a numberof copra-producingareas of the Pacific and Indian oceans. It is believed to have been introduced in rubber seedling potplants from Ceylon to the Pacific island of Upolu, Western Samoain 1909(86); from there it spread to the neighboring island of Savai’i and Tutuila in American Samoa. In 1921 the beetle was recorded in Niuatoputapu (Keppel) Island in the Kingdomof Tonga, but it was successfully eradicated in a campaignfrom 1922to 1930. Wallis Island, about 320

kmwest of Samoa, becameinfested in 1931 (22). During the SecondWorld Warthere was an increase in aircraft and shipping activity in the Pacific region; the beetle was introduced to the Palau Islands about 1942(56), New Britain in 1942, and WestIrian (20). Further establishments occurred Vavau (Tonga), 1952 (34); NewIreland, 1952; Pak Island and Manus Island (New Guinea), 1960; Tongatapu (Tonga), 1961; and the Tokelau Islands, 1963. The beetle was found at Suva on Viti Levu (main island of the Fiji group) early in 1953(167), and it has nowspread to at least islands of the group, including all the important copra-producing ones, despite an intensive quarantine programto prevent this (11). In the Indian Oceanthe island of DiegoGarcia was infested during the First WorldWar, possibly by beetles carried on troopships (135). Specimenswere collected in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in 1940. In July 1962 it was found Mauritius (177) and in 1978 in Reunion (121).
O. monocerosand O. boas are endemicin east and west Africa; the former also occurs in the Seychelles Islands (174). Oryctes spp. that attack date palms are distributed a.s follows: O. sahariensis in Chad and Sudan; O. agamemno(n = O. sinaicus) in the Sinai Peninsula, Saudi Arabia, and the Persian Gulf coast of Iran; and O. elegans in the Mesopotamianregion of Iraq and in neighboring Iran (29). The four subspecies of S. australis are distributed as follows: S. a. australis on the PapuaNewGuinea mainland west of the HuonGulf, S. a. brevicornis east of the Gulf, S. a. grossepunctatus in NewBritain and NewIreland, and S. a. salomonensis on Bougainville and a numberof the SolomonIslands (13, 35, 39). The distribution the geographical subspecies of X. gideon has b~eenmapped(41) and extends from the Himalayas, India and Sri Lanka eastwards throughout southeast Asia to Papua NewGuinea, north Queensland, and the NewHebrides.
BREEDING SITES
Large numbers of O. rhinoceros larvae may develop in the tops of dead standing coconut palms that have been killed by adult beetle attacks or lightning strike (13, 27, 96, 166), war damage[e.g. Palau Islands (56), Philippines (162)], or other causes. In the Philippines, palms killed cadang-cadang disease become breeding sites (162). Coconut stumps and logs on the groundare also important breeding sites (56, 135). Floating logs containing larvae in tunnels might spread the pest to newareas (96). The insect may also breed in other types of decaying wood, compost, and sawdust heaps in Tonga, Samoa,and Fiji; decaying Pandanustrunks in the Palaus (56); and heaps of decaying cocoa pod shells in NewIreland (13). In India (93, 127) and Mauritius (121) heaps of cattle dung were the important sites, whereas in Burmadead coconut stems, heaps of rotting

paddy straw, and farmyard manure were most important (53). In Malaysia larvae developedin decaying rubber stumps(2). It wasreported that larvae occurred in rubbish in the axils of living palms whengroundbreeding sites were unavailable (124). Mackie(99) stated that in the Philippines breeding could occur in piles of rotting coconut husks, but other authors have not confirmed this. Dead standing coconut trunks and fallen logs are used by a numberof Oryctes spp. in Madagascar(3). O. monocerosbreeds in dead standing conconut and oil palms in Sierra Leone(63), Nigeria (65), and Ivory Coast (103), and in decaying coconut logs in Zanzibar (101), Kenya (33), and Seychelles (174). owariensis breeds in dead sta nding oil palm, coconut, and Raphia trunks in Sierra Leone(63, 65); O. ohausi in standing rotten Raphiapalmtrunks in Nigeria (65); and O. sjSstedti in debris in dead leaf bases just below crowns of oil palms in Nigeria (65). In Togo the numerouspalms killed by Kaincop6 disease becomeOryctes breeding sites (103), and the sameapplies to old oil palms poisonedwith diquat in Nigeria (156). O. centaurus in Papau NewGuinea breeds mainly in dead standing sago palm trunks (Metroxylon sagu) but may also use dead coconut poles (14, 66). boas breeds in manure heaps (63 , 65, 101)but n ot i n ro tti wood.In Iraq, O. elegans breeds in the stems of dying or newly dead date palms(85); in Iran it breedsin deadtrunks or in litter in the axils of fronds (52).
There has been considerable confusion in the literature concerning the breeding sites of S. australis," manyearlier authors assumedthat they were identical to those of O. rhinoceros (97, 134, 138, 146, 163). Howevetrhis assumption has been shown to be invalid, and it is now established that Scapanes breeds under the decaying trunks and stumps of bush trees and occasionally in rotting moist humusbeneath heaps of decaying cocoa pod shells (13, 14). X. gideon breeds in rotten leaves, decayed wood,compost, and at the surface of the soil beneath decaying coconut logs (7). T. fairmairei breeds in tunnels in root massesof ferns, belonging to the Asplenium nidus group, that grow on branches of living trees (6). In Puerto Rico, Strategus quadrifoveatus (= S. oblongus) breeds in decaying coconut logs and other wood(142).
BIOLOGY OF THE IMMATURE STAGES
The duration of the immaturestages of O. rhinoceros has been studied by various authors under differing conditions (13, 20, 21, 51, 54, 56, 62, 80, 93, 124). General figures based on four publications (13, 20, 62, 80) shownin Table 1, as well as laboratory results for O. boas (75), O. elegans (81), O. monoceros (82), Scapanes australis grossepunctatus (13), and Strategus aloeus (84). Somefigures are available for S. quadrifoveatus(142).

The immaturestages of Scapaneslast muchlonger than those of the Oryctes species.
Unfavorableclimatic or nutritional conditions for O. rhinoceros delayed
larval development, which was extended to as long as 14 months, and smaller than average adults were sometimesproduced(20). Whenthe larvae of O. elegans, O. rhinoceros, and O. monoceroswere fed living vegetable material in the laboratory, those of O. elegans developed best (which is perhaps correlated with the ability of these larvae to damagedate palms), whereas those of O. monoceros developed most poorly. However, for all three species developmentwas slower and the resulting adults smaller and
less fecund than whenthe larvae were fed on dead plant material (76). a study of their sensory physiology, O. rhinoceros larvae were allowed a choice betweendifferent conditions in a circular area (21 cmin diameter) divided into two halves (25). The larvae preferred a temperature of 27-29°C and avoided higher or lower temperatures. Theywere attracted by the smell of ammoniaand acetone (perhaps present in natural breeding sites) and repelled by acetic acid. Movementwas momentarily arrested by sudden exposure to bright light, and the larvae then movedto the shaded area. Larval behavior was dominatedby the light factor. In the natural environment, if larvae are placed on the surface of breeding medium,they quickly burrow downout of sight; this strong negative phototaxis is probably an adaptation against desiccation and predation. Lower humidities were avoided and higher relative humidities (85-95%) always selected. These mechanismssingly or in combinationkeep the larvae out of areas that are unfavorable for survival or development.
The late third instar larva in a partly decomposedlog usually burrows into a firm part of the log prior to pupation. If it is in a soft heap it may

burrow downinto the soil beneath. Whenreared in friable material, a roomy cocoon with a smooth inner surface is formed from compacted medium(10, 13). In this cocoon a nonfeeding prepupal period is followed by the pupal and teneral adult phases.
FEEDING AND DAMAGE CAUSED BY ADULTS
Host Plants
Gressitt (56) gave a comprehensivelist of food plants used by O. rhinoceros in addition to coconut and oil palms. Lists of host plants have been noted for India (115, 127), Indonesia (91), and the Philippines (99). In Mauritius, ornamentals such as the royal palm (Roystonea regia), the latanier palm (Livistona chinensis), the talipot palm (Coryphaumbraculifera), and the raphia palm (Raphia ruffia) are attacked (I 21). S. quadrifoveatus feeds on several species of palm and occasionally on sugarcane stalks (142). Besides palms, Scapanesaustralis subspecies bore into the stems of banana plants (Musa sapientum) and Manila hemp(Musa textilis) (13, 169).
Modeof Attack and Effect of Damage
The way in which O. rhinoceros attacks coconut palms, and the resulting V or wedge-shaped appearance of the cut fronds have been described and illustrated by several authors (e.g. 27, 51, 62, 86, 99, 124). Attacks tend be concentrated on the margins of palmgroves and on taller, moreprominent palms (27, 183). Oneattack increases the likelihood of further attacks (8, 183), i.e. certain palms are morefrequently attacked than would expected by chance. Morethan one beetle mayattack a palm at the same time, while a neighboring palm maybe unattacked (56). In badly infested areas in India, five to six beetles have been foundfeeding in the samecrown (124).
Thestructure of the crownin relation to beetle attacks has been comprehensivelydescribed (183). Thecentral cluster consists of four to eight spears (very youngfronds, whichhave not yet unfurled to expose and extend their leaflets). After unfurling, the midrib or rachis of the frond makesan angle with the stem (the axil). Theaxil of the youngest(i.e. uppermost)unfurling frond is (designated) axil 1, and lower, older fronds are numberedsequentially. In each axil a spadix bearing both male and female flowers develops into an inflorescence, whichis at first enclosed by a spathe of sheathing bracts.
Studies in Western Samoa(183) showedthat most attacks begin in axils of openedfronds 4-6; very few attacks begin below frond 8. The lower the attack site, the morefronds will be damagedand the closer the beetle will come to the inflorescences and the central growing points. Such lower

attacks are dangerous, but rare. Attacking higher axils is advantageousto the beetle because the tissues are softer. The burrowhas a short, straight horizontal section leading into the palmcenter, fromwhicha longer vertical tunnel penetrates 15-50 cmdowninto the center of the spear cluster. The beetle feeds on tissue juices. Someof the crushedfibre is pushedoutside the entrance hole, whereit indicates the insect’s presence (99). For 116occupied burrows measuredin crowns of 2- to 10-year-old palms, the average depth was 16 cm; 63 recently vacated burrows showedan average depth of 21 cm; the range for both empty and occupied burrows was 2-50 cm (62). An experiment in which beetles were placed in artificial holes 4 cm deep indicated an average stay of 6 days (range 4-8 days) and a penetration rate of 5 cm/day for 3 days, followed by 3 days of less active burrowing (2 cm/day) (62). Results in Indonesia indicated a stay of 5-10 days (91). NewBritain a male/femalesex ratio of 0.91 for beetles in crownsoccurred (8). Most females had immatureoocytes in the ovaries.
Thereis no exit burrow,and if a beetle remainst~p to about 9 days in its feeding burrow, palm growth will carry the entrance upwards and clear of the stipule (the coarse fibrous band enclosing the frond base), allowing the insect to escape easily (183). The central vertical feeding burrow may appear to be harmfulto the palmbut in fact often causes little real damage. If the burrow goes deep enoughit maycut across the top of a very young spear, and if very deep it maydestroy the growingpoint, but probably few palms are directly killed in this manner. The short horizontal entrance burrow, cutting directly across petioles (lower part of midribs) and spears (truncating fronds and leaflets) causes far greater damage.Older palms have a more compactcrown and therefore have more fronds affected by a single attack than younger palms. An attack damagedan average of 4.2 fronds; 3.6 fronds had damagedleaflets on 9-year-old palms, and 4.3 to 5.9 fronds were damagedon older palms. Earlier estimates were 2-3 fronds damaged by an attack (60), or up to 5 fronds (27). Each attack on 9-year-old palms cut out approximately0.41 of a frond, except wherepart or the wholefrond broke off in windyareas because of a damagedmidrib or petiole (183). The time span from the initial penetration by the beetle until the damagefirst became visible from the ground averaged 41 days, and it was 113 days before all damagebecamevisible. Except whereinttorescences were directly damaged,no immediateeffect of the attacks on flowering and nut bearing could be determined. The long-term effect of weakeningdue to leaf reduction could not be quantified because attacks occurred very irregularly and the study did not continue long enough. Sison (162) stated that palms with 50%of all their fronds damagedhad about one-fifth the numberof developing nuts that are found on normal palms. Manyimmature nuts were dropped by the damaged palms.

316 BEDFORD
Pruning experiments were therefore conducted (183). In one trial, fronds were cut from palms over a period of 20 months---equivalent to the effect of 30separate attacks at a rate of 1.5/month;in another trial, pruning equivalent to 15 attacks in 20 monthswas performed. The palms responded to frond loss by increasing the drop-off of immaturebutton nuts during the early shedding phase and by aborting entire inflorescences a few months before natural flowering time. Pruning equivalent to 1.5 attacks/month would have killed the palms if sustained long enough, even though the growing points were undamaged. Howeverthis pruning was more severe than the normal level of beetle damage. The rate of frond replacement, numberof flowers on each inflorescence, and rate of growth of nuts held to maturity werescarcely, if at all, affected. Theresults of the pruningstudy showedhowyield is affected, but did not show the size of the effect. Experimentsin India showedthat large scale cutting of younger fronds may cause considerable reducti6n in yield of nuts as long as the practice is continued (102). Manydifficulties are encountered in studying the effect beetle attack on yield (149, 150, 183), and a full analysis of the problem remains to be carried out.
Onoil palms O. rhinoceros bores into the base of the cluster of spears, causing wedge-shaped cuts in the unfolded fronds. In young palms where the spears are narrower and penetration mayoccur lower down,the effects of damage can be much more severe than in older palms (179, 181). Pathogens mayenter the woundand cause secondary rotting of the bud. Sometimes the new spears of a palm recovering from attack may grow throughthe hole madeby the beetle whenit entered the spear cluster. Palms less than a year old are often killed by the attack, but the likelihood that the damagewill prove lethal declines rapidly as the palms mature.
Damageby O. monocerosto coconuts has been studied in the Ivory Coast (103, 106, 108, 109). In palms aged 1-2 years, 36%of attacks occurred the axil of the third unfurled frond from the top. In palms three or more years old, 50%of attacks occurred in the axil of the second frond from the top. Oneattack damaged75%of the youngfronds in the spear cluster, i.e. 2-4 fronds. The numberof fronds affected depended on the length of the burrow, which was as much as 1 m but usually averaged 45 cm in adult palms (106, 109). Onyoungpalms the beetle only needed to burrow a short distance in order to reach the growingpoint and kill or severely deformthe palm. However,attacks on older palms were rarely lethal. The insect burrowed4.2 cm/day, and stayed about 9 days in its tunnel. The central spear cluster grows about 4 cm/dayand counterbalances boring of the beetle in the wet season, but growthis muchslower in the dry season. In a plantation of 4-year-old palms, 70%of attacks occurred in the first six rows, with 50% in the first three rows, whereasin a planting of 2-year-old palms, the first

BIOLOGY OF PALM RHINOCEROSBEETLES 317
12 rows received 70%of the attacks. Taller palms received more attacks than younger lower palms (silhouette effect). Even in young plantations certain palms were attacked repeatedly while similar-sized neighbours were not infested. Possibly beetles are attracted by odors fromthe damagedtissue (106). Onsomeplantations of 21/2-3-year-old coconut palms in Zanzibar, O. monoeeros killed more than half and retarded the growth of others. Mature palms were also attacked, but the damagewas not serious. Isolated palms and those on poor soil were more often attacked than those in dense groves (101). In Kenya it was also observed that attacks occurred more frequently to palms in outer plantation rows (33). At one locality deaths bearing palms average 2%per year. Assumingreplanting took place immediately, this represents about a 15%loss of bearing capacity, because the replants require 7-8 years to comeinto bearing (178). In the Seychelles seedling coconuts were killed or the palms were seriously damagedduring their first 5-7 years of life (113, 174).
In MadagascarO. simiar attacks coconut palms coming into bearing in a mannersimilar to that. of O. rhinoceros. It also bores into the leaf bases of banana plants (3). O. pyrrhus burrows into the soil to attack coconut seedlings at the junction of stem and nut (3, 166) and at the bases 4-year-old oil palms. O. ranavalotunnels into moist soil to attack the bases of bambooplants (3).
Scapanesaustralis usually restricts its attacks to youngcoconuts, from just past the seedling stage to about five years of age (13, 14, 164, 165). The beetles crawl downan axil before boring into the heart of the stem, or they bore straight into the trunk fromthe outside. Becauseit readily attacks very young palms which cannot sustain much damage and consequently are often killed, it is a moreserious pest in Melanesiathan O. rhinoceros. More males than females were removed from holes in NewBritain. The male/ female sex ratio was about 3.6, possibly because males spend more time visiting palms and feeding while females are presumably searching for breeding sites. Often more than one beetle occurred in the same hole; females were usually deeper inside than males (8). Sometimesthe growing point of 1-2-year-old palms was not completely destroyed; however, the plant was always more or less deformedand produced twisted fronds with the leaflets compressedand crumpled together. Palms a little older when damagedoften had the inner fronds invaded by termites and mealybugs. The incidence of S. australis attack varied greatly from one locality to another, but washighest in newplantings established near virgin forest. On youngoil palms damagetook the form of holes in the frond bases, midribs of fronds chewedthrough, ends of fronds V-cut, and stunting and twisting sideways of the growing point, with the leaflets of emergingfronds compressed and deformed. In a few cases the young oil palm was killed (13).

Strategus quadrifoveatus tunnels 4-6 cminto the soil and then attacks the base of the coconut seedling sprout or the stems of palms up to 3 years old, causing death of the plant. Liability to lethal attack declines rapidly after the young palm begins to form a trunk. Beetles mayinterrupt a feeding period in order to return to their burrowsand maketrips to the surface of the soil (142). WhenStrategus aloeus burrowsinto the soil, it starts 50 cm awayfrom the palm; once it is under the stem base it tunnels up into the base, frequently reaching the growingpoint. Onlyplants 1-2 years old are attacked, mainly at the beginning of the rainy season (109). In west New Britain, Papuanawoodlarkianaattacked the roots of youngoil palm seedlings (wrappedin nursery bags) about 4 cmbelowthe level of soil, causing severe root damageand death of seedlings. Subsequently the beetles moved downwards,pierced the bottoms of the bags, and entered the soil beneath to a depth of about 30 era. Althoughthe numberof seedlings attacked at any one time is small, the numberattacked during the several monthsthat the seedlings are in the nursery is quite significant (30). Xylotrupes gideon feeds on newlyopenedcoconut inflorescences (7) and is said to feed on the undersurface of frond midribs, causing the distal portion to break and hang down.
Methods of DamageAssessment
Twomethodsof damageassessment have been evolved in order to judge the effectiveness of control measures. In the detailed type of survey, random samples of 20-30 palms at various sites are numberedwith paint. Periodically the numberof fronds above the horizontal level in the crownof each palmis counted with the aid of binoculars, as well as the numberof fronds which showbeetle cuts (11, 182). Results are expressed as the percentage of fronds damagedat one site or at a group of sites combined. The method is time-consuming, as each palmshould be examinedfrom several sides. In the rapid survey methodonly the central 3-5 fronds of the crown, i.e. the most recently opened ones, are considered. Palms are scored as either damagedin these fronds or undamaged; the total numberof fronds damagedis ignored. At a given locality, four observation points are selected. An observer goes to each point in turn, faces in a given direction, observes 25 palms clearly visible to him, and records the numbershowingcentral crown damage.The results of the four observations are summedto give the percentage of palmsdamagedfor the area. To increase reliability, twoor three observers can worktogether and the averageof their results can be obtained. Provided that all observers use the same observation points and face the sam~direction, they need not observe the same individual palms (49).
Anattempt has been madeto correlate the following data: artificial reduction in leaf area, with reduction in nut production(49); the percentage

Annual Reviews www.annualreviews.org/aronline
BIOLOGY OF PALMRHINOCEROSBEETLES 319
of fronds beetle-damagedon a sampleof 100palms, with an estimate of the percentage reduction in total leaf area; the percentage of fronds beetledamagedin a sampleof 500 palms, with the numberof developing nuts; the percentage of beetle-damaged fronds, with the percentage of trees with central crown damage; and the percentage of centrally damagedtrees and the percentage of fronds damaged,with estimated percentage nut loss.
Correlations between percentages of palms with central crown damage and percentages of nut loss yielded the following figures: 0-10%damaged, 1% loss; 10-20%, 4%; 20-30%, 6%; 30-40%, 8%; 40-60%, 12%; 6080%, 17%; 80-100%, 23%. However it is not known how reliable these results were. Significant observational error mayhave occurred in estimating the per~ntage reduction in leaf area due to beetle cutting. There is a large standard error in correlating percentageof fronds that werebeetle-cut with percentage of trees that had central damage.Also, the correlation betweenpercentage of beetle-damagedfronds/tree and the numberof developing nuts/tree was based on a sample at only one location. Palmsat other locations, of different ages, growingon different soils, and under different climatic conditions mayhave their nut production affected to different degrees by beetle attack.
GENERAL BIOLOGY OF THE ADULTS
O. rhinocerosadults leave their pupationsites 20-30days after ecdysis (188) and visit palmsfor feeding. Matingoccurs in the breeding sites (27, 188). Multiple matings mayoccur (77) but are not essential, since spermatozoa retain their vitality for up to six monthsin the female’s spermatheca(83). Laboratory studies have shown that 3-week-old females and 5-week-old malescan matebefore the first flight andfeeding, i.e. oviposition can occur before beetles emergefromthe breeding sites in which they developed(74, 188). Howeveirn the field, mating and oviposition usually take place after the youngbeetles haveleft the pupationsite and after the first feeding (188). Under mass-rearing conditions at La Mini~re, France, the meanlongevity was five months, but males died several weeks before females. The mean fecundity was 49 (80) or 60 eggs/female (83). In a NewBritain insectary, adult males lived 6.4 monthsand females, 9.1 months, with a meanfecundity of 51 eggs (13), whereasin India the average longevity was 4.7 months (124). Informationon tunnels in oviposition sites and on egg clutch size has been gathered in Western Samoa(62).
O. monocerospairs were found in copula in decaying logs (33). Under mass-rearing conditions the meanlongevity was three months, and fecundity was 25 eggs/female, with wide individual differences. Spermatozoa stored in the female’s spermatheca remainedviable for three months(83).

320 BEDFORD
Field-collected adults lived morethan 100 days after collection (33). The meanfecundity of O. boas was 40 eggs/female; oviposition commencedfour weeksafter the last molt and lasted 2-6 weeksduring a longevity of 6-12 weeks, which allowed two generations per year (75). O. elegans began oviposition 2-3 weeksafter pairing and the adults lived an average of four months, with a meanfecundity of 60 eggs/female (81). Scapanes australis grossepunctatus had a meanfecundity of 30 eggs/female and the meanadult life of both sexes was115 days (13), whereas X. gideon ulysses males lived an average of 90 days and females, 102 days, with a meanfecundity of 55 eggs (7).
Apart from X. gideon and Papuanaspp., rhinoceros beetles are rarely attracted to ordinary lights (142, 179). In laboratory studies O. rhinoceros crawledtowardsred and purple lights, in preference to other colors (55). flew in the field mainly between6 and 7 V.M.(96). Checkson youngpalms showedthat 80%of O. monocerosand O. boas had madetheir flight by the third hour after nightfall (106). O. rhinoceros freshly fed on palm were flownon a tether in the laboratory; their flight lasted between2-3 hr, and distances traveled were 2-4 km(62). Three beetles flew 680 mfrom the nearest land to a ship between 8 and 9 P.M. (131)..In India manybeetles dispersed only 180m fromtheir breeding sites (124). In 1883all plant and animal life was destroyed on Krakatoa, Indonesia by the volcanic eruption. In 1919 damage was found on palms there, and also a dead beetle. The island is 19 km from the nearest neighbor, Sibesi, and 40 km from the nearest coast of Java and Sumatra. Beetles mayhave flown in or mayhave been carried as larvae in floating logs (96). MostO. monocerosadults that weretagged with iridium-192 and released froma central point in a plantation travelled a radius of 150-200 m to palm crowns (107).
MASS REARING
Mass rearing was pioneered by Hurpin and colleagues at La Mini~re, France for O. elegans (81), O. monoceros and O. boas (75, 82, 83), rhinoceros (80, 82, 83), and Strategus aloeus (84). A mixture of ~ parts decaying woodand ½ parts cowdungwas prepared and allowed to stand while the heat of fermentation destroyed the spores of the pathogenic fungus Metarrhizium anisopliae, which had greatly hindered mass rearing previously (123). Larvae were held in this food mediumsingly or were bulked together in large containers at 28-30°C,and they eventually pupated in it, yidding 60-80 adults for every 100 larvae. O. monoceros adults emergedabout 14 weeks after the eggs hatched, and O. rhinoceros adults after 30 weeks (82). Adults were confined as single couples, or several couples together, in containers that were one-third filled with leaf moldor rotted sawdust in which they mated and oviposited; they were fed on

bananaslices placed on the surface of the mediumtwice weekly. A50 liter tank that enclosed 8-10 couples has proved very convenient and needs less handling (83). Longevity and fecundity under these conditions have been mentionedin the previous section. Bedford (10) used a similar methodfor O. rhinoceros in Fiji but preferred to steam-sterilize the larval food and oviposition media because of the widespread occurrence of Metarrhizium and baculovirus in sawdust heaps. Also, the eggs and young larvae were kept bulkedbut wereseparated into individual tins at the early third instar so that, should any case of fungus or virus occur, it wouldbe confined to particular tins andwouldnot affect all the larvae or pupaein an entire bulk box. Rearing was done at ambient temperature. The fecundity was 40 eggs/female;fertility of eggswas53%;yield of third instar larvae fromeggs, 42%; yield of adults reared from eggs, 38%; and total duration from egg hatching to emergence of adults from cocoons was 274 days. Wageswere the biggest cost component.In 1974-1975the cost of producinga beetle was $F 0.74, far cheaper than the cost of field collection.
In massrearing in WesternSamoa(155) the rate of growth of O. rhinoceros larvae was faster on a mixture of unfermented kapok woodand cowdung than on a mixture fermented for several days at 70°C. Perhaps the fermentation reduces the nutritive value of the mixture. Onset of pupation could be induced by transferring larvae 21-27 weeksold from28°Cto 25°C. Pupation then occurred at least one monthearlier than whenthe larvae were left in the warmertemperature. In a container 95%of the larvae becameprepupae within a weekof each other. Whereyoungand old larvae were present in a container, the younglarvae at first preventedthe pupation of the older ones. Later, however,the pupation of youngerlarvae wasfaster in the presence of older larvae. A similar phenomenonis found in field breeding sites wherethe pupationof a groupof larvae apparently is synchronized. Astrain of femaleswasselected that gave higher egg production(3.52 eggs/female/week) than normal (2.72 eggs/female/week) and lived four weeks longer than the normal strain.
S. a. grossepunctatus were fed on sugar cane and wouldoviposit only in boxes of black soil (13). Only 18%of the eggs hatched. Larvae developed well in individual tins of a cowdung/sawdustmixture, which they eventually compactedto form the pupal chamber. X. gideon oviposited in boxes of rotted sawdust and the larvae were reared in the same manneras Scapanes (7).
NATURAL ENEMIES AND BIOLOGICAL CONTROL

areas for the control of O. rhinoceros (68, 73). Howeveresults have been disappointing, because few significant enemieswere foundor they failed to become established when transferred to new areas; and if they became established they failed to exert significant control over O. rhinocerospopulations. The wasp Scolia oryctophaga was introduced from Madagascar to Mauritius in 1917 against the sugar cane pest O. tarandus (28) and apparently reduced its numbers, but the extent of this control has never been determined (122) and it did not prevent O. rhinoceros from becominga pest there. S. oryctophagadid not becomeestablished in the Pacific (157). Scolia ruficornis was sent from Zanzibar to Western Samoa in 1945 and was recovered in 1949 (158, 160, 161), but it did not reduce the O. rhinoceros population to a subeconomiclevel (61). It was established in the Palau Islands by 1953(136), and it was sent to DiegoGarcia in 1951and recovered in 1956but wasnot effective in controlling O. rhinoceros there (135). It was released in the Gazelle Peninsula of NewBritain in the early 1950s but was not found during 1968-1971 (13). Scolia procer parasitizes O. rhinoceros and Chalcosomaatlas larvae in logs in Malaysia (67, 179) and was released in Tongain 1974 (49).
The carabid beetle Neochryopus savagei, which is predaceous both as larvae and adults on Orycteslarvae in Nigeria (65), wasshippedto Fiji (133) and NewGuinea, but whether it became established is doubtful. The carabid Pherosophussp. was introduced from India (151) to Mauritius and becameestablished there, but it did not significantly control O. rhinoceros larvae (121). Twospecies of elaterids with larvae predaceouson O. rhinoceros larvae are established in WesternSamoa,but their effect is not known. Twenty-eightspecies of predators werelisted in India but their effectiveness is not known(100). Thereduviid Platymeris laevicollis feeds on O. monoceros adults in palm crowns in East Africa (64, 173) and attacked O. rhinoceros in cages. Although widely released in NewGuinea, Western Samoa, Tonga,and Mauritius, there is no evidence that it becameestablished (13, 121, 168), and perhaps the youngnymphswere destroyed by ants. Hypoaspis sp. mites maydestroy Oryctes eggs (168).
Nematodes
The nematode Oryctonemagenitalis was described from the bursa eopulatrix of females and the aedeagus of males of O. monoceros in the Ivory Coast. It reproduces in the bursa, maybe transferred during beetle mating, feeds on spermatozoa, seminal fluid, and secretions of the bursal wall, and does not normally survive long outside the host. Its effect on the host and its reproduction are not known(143). Another nematode, Rhabditis adenobia, was described from the colleterial glands of O. monocerosfemales. It seemsto have no injurious effect on the host and feeds on secretions and

bacteria (144). Thelastomapterygoton was described from the intestine of O. monocerosand O. boas larvae in the Ivory Coast (145). Nematodeswere found in the above organs of various Oryctes spp. in Madagascar(3) and in the bursa of O. gnu in Malaysia, O. monocerosin East Africa, and O. centaurus in Papua NewGuinea (68).
Fungi
The use of the fungus Metarrhizium anisopliae against O. rhinoceros has beenalternately in and out of favor since 1913.Thehistory of its earlier use has been reviewedtogether with a discussion of a morerecent field trial at Fagaloa Bay in Western Samoa(168). Alow incidence occurred on Oryctes spp. in Madagascar(3, 116), Asia, and Africa (166, 191). Onthe southwest coast of India a high infestation occurred in the monsoonseason (128) and it was prevalent in 1956 from Mayto October when humidity exceeded 70%, temperature was about 27°C, and the sky overcast more than 50% of the time (126). In 1964a similar infestation occurred in Assam(100).
O. monoceroslarvae all died after three weeks at 28°Cin breeding mediuminfected with mild doses of M. anisopliae conidiospores (103 per g of medium). Temperature greatly influenced the development of the disease, which reached a maximumintensity between 25°C and 30°C. The humidity of the mediummayor maynot favor the infection. Onlystrains belonging to the major type (conidiospores measuring more than 9/t in length) and isolated from five Oryctes spp. were pathogenic to O. monoceros(32, 46). In India the long-spored (major) form was confined to O. rhinoceros, whereas short-spored forms occurred on other hosts. Only isolates from O. rhinoceros could inf6ct O. rhinoceros (148). Althoughmost insects studied are susceptible only to the strain isolated fromthe samespecies, Oryctesspp. larvae are susceptible to all the strains comingfromseveral Oryctes spp. (47). Morerecently (43) it has been suggestedthat rhinoceros lar vae are susceptible only to the strain isolated fromthis species. This is a somewhat different result from that obtained by Latch (94) whofound that all longspore isolates from Oryctes spp. were pathogenic to O. rhinoceros and that 23 short-spore (minor) cultures isolated fromother insects caused lesions on O. rhinoceros, but only 5 werelethal. Anisolate introduced into the field is unlikely to be morepathogenic than any of the long-spore strains already there. Only strains of major form that had been isolated from Oryctes spp. were pathogenic to O. rhinoceros adults. Half the adults died 75-80 days after spraying with 10 ml of suspension containing 1 X 10s-1 X 106 spores/ml). Total mortality was obtained with concentrations of 1 X 107 spores/ml. A minor strain isolated from O. rhinoceros could develop saprophytically if a very concentrated spore inoculumwasapplied to a fresh O. rhinoceros cadaver (48). The fungus is mass produced saprophytically

on oat grains and can be applied as a microbial pesticide to the surface of breeding sites such as sawdust heaps. Three monthsafter surface application most O. rhinoceros larvae are killed, and the spores remain viable in the breeding sites for at least 24 months(95). Afiltrate fromM.anisopliae altered the nucleus and cytoplasm of O. rhinoceros hemocytesin vitro and prevented their fusion and agglomeration (175). Cordycepssp. killed up to 50%of Oryctes larvae in decaying logs on Isle Sainte Marie, Madagascar (3) but could not be bred in the laboratory.
Other Diseases Surany (166) described "Heidenreich’s watery disintegration disease" whichthe larval fat bodyatrophies, hemolympihncreases, the skin becomes translucent, and the larva movesto the surface of the mediumto die. Althoughthe disease could not be transmitted with techniques available at that time, a virus was suspected. It wasespecially noted at Medan,Sumatra, and Zanzibar, East Africa. Later the condition was thought to be an artifact due to unsuitable food (111). Howeverit is nowknownthat baculovirus does exist at Medan(191), so that Surany’s conclusions regarding the viral nature of the disease there are probably correct. Marschall’s (111) criticism mayapply only to the Zanzibar material, since no virus has been reported in Africa and since Marsehall workedonly on the African O. boas and O. monoceros.Surany (166) also described "Maya’sblue disease" in whichthe larva turns blue and dies over a period of hours. No causal agent was isolated, and it was believed (111) that an external trauma (e.g. the shock of a falling palm) caused rupture of one of the delicate gut diverticles, allowing the contents to ooze out into the hemolymphand causing the blue color to spread throughout the body. The condition can be produced artificially by throwing larvae hard onto the ground or by rough handling. Interestingly, "blue disease" was nameda "controlling" factor in Oryctes populations in Madagascar(98) and the Philippines (42). In the latter somesymptomsdescribed could have been due to baculovirus, nowknown to occur there (191).
Protozoan gregarine cysts have been observed in Oryctes spp. larvae and adults (3, 13, 71, 116, 172)but appearto havelittle adverseeffect. Avariety of diseases of the European Melolontha melolontha were not effective against Oryctes spp. larvae (79).
POPULATION FLUCTUATIONS AND POPULATION REGULATION
Collection of O. boas from crowns in the Ivory Coast showed marked regular fluctuations, with maximumcatch in the dry season and minimum catch in the wet season, and a male/femalesex ratio of 0.25 (105). Fluctua-

tions were similar on different plantations. The insect did not breed in decaying logs and so was unaffected by destruction of this wood. Fluctuations in O. monocerosnumberslacked the regularity and amplitude of O. boas and varied from plantation to plantation depending on alterations to breeding sites in the vicinity. All stages werepresent throughout the year, resulting in a completeoverlap of generations. Sexratio was0.90 in crowns and 1.96 in breeding sites. Onthe sameplantation there was no correspondence between population variations in the two species.
In NewBritain the immigration rate of O. rhinoceros into blocks of 3-5 year-old coconuts showedno annual cycle or overall trend, but it was reduced by rain (8). Sex ratio was 0.91. The immigration rate of Seapanes australis grossepunctatusdecreased with time (i.e. as the palmsgrew older) but was not affected by rain. Sex ratio was 3.69. Thetrend in the relative population size of O. rhinocerosat a plantation in NewBritain with 10-yearold coconuts, high rainfall, and manybreeding sites wasstudied (9) by using coconut "stump" traps to capture adults searching for breeding sites. The high initial population declined over the following three years, with the gradual disappearance of the breeding sites. Catches were somewhathigher at newmoonbut weredepressed by rain. Sexratio was 0.31, and all females were mated and had mature eggs in the lower ends of the oviducts. Adults ofS. quadrifoveatus in Puerto Rico (142) were most abundant in June-July, but most stages were present throughout the year.
Natural enemiesseemto have little effect in regulating Oryctes numbers. Manyauthors agree that the maindeterminant of Oryctes abundanceis the numberand availability of suitable breeding sites (3, 13, 27, 33, 56, 62, 66, 87, 109, 115, 116, 166). Overcrowdingin breeding sites (33, 62), as well density of palms available for feeding (27, 58, 121), maybe an important factor.
METHODS OF CONTROL OTHER THAN BY BACULOVIRUS
Beetles have been traditionally removedfrom feeding holes in youngpalms with wires that are hookedor barbed at the end, but often only after damage has been done (21, 56, 114). Theymayalso be cut from holes, but usually this causes moredamageand the woundsattract morebeetles or the secondary pest Rhynchophorus. Traps consisting of heaps of compost or wood (sometimestreated with M.anisopliae) (96, 99, 101, 142) or lengths of split palm log laid on the ground(27, 179) have been used but are laborious set up and require frequent checking lest they themselves becomebreeding grounds (56). All authors are unanimousin advocating the destruction breeding sites (e.g. 50, 56, 62, 73, 99, 103, 108, 114, 162); howeverthe methods are laborious, expensive, unpopular, and frequently ignored. In

Western Samoadead coconut trunks were dumpedin the sea (20), whereas in Malaysia (24) and the Ivory Coast (23) the trunks were cut into lengths for stacking and burning. Theproblemsin cutting and burning old oil palm stands in Malaysia have been described (179), and in Indonesia burying rather than burning trunks was suggested (96). Poisoning oil palms with arboricides prior to felling accelerates natural rotting (179). Grovesanitation reduced by 67%the loss of replanted palms due to Strategus attack (142). Manyplantations in the South Pacific and Asia are overmature and should be felled and replanted. This has spurred interest in utilization of coconut trunks for timber and furniture-making (1, 49, 170), fence posts (49), and charcoal makingin (49) small- and large-scale kilns.
A chemical screening program revealed that ethyl dihydrochrysanthemumate(chrislure) applied in metal vane, traps wasan effective attractant for O. rhinoceros (la). Whenapplied to the muchcheaper coconut cap traps, morebeetles were caught than in metal traps (5). Subsequently, the commercially available and cheaper ethyl chrysanthemumate (rhinolure) was found to be almost as effective (99a). Howevereven with a high density of traps in a small area, manybeetles do not enter the traps. Although useful in field surveys, the traps have not been developedto a stage where they can contribute to field control programsin the South Pacific because the cost of servicing themand vandalism are major drawbacks(49). Rhinolure with an olfactory reinforcer was tested against O. monocerosin the Ivory Coast with 4 traps/hectare. Morebeetles were caught by traps at the plantation borders and whenthe breeding sites were covered by vegetation; in the latter case the traps apparently imitate the odors of natural breeding sites (90).
O. rhinoceros was eradicated from Niuatoputapu Island by destruction of the insects and breedingsites over a seven-yearperiod endingin 1930(20, 159, 161), but this would be uneconomic nowadays. Eradication was attempted at two islands in Fiji. Some506 coconut cap rhinolure traps were operated on Vomo(109 hectares) and 317 traps on Bekana (16 hectares); from December1971to the end of February 1974, 3644beetles (1626 males, 2018 females) were removed from Vomoand 2462 from Bekana (1082 males, 1380 females). Destruction of breeding sites and larvae was done concurrently (18, 19), and palm damagedeclined. Howeveras there remained a low but persistent population which could not be trapped, it appearedthat possible results fromthe indefinite continuation of the trial were no longer commensuratewith the costs, and the trial ended in late February 1974. Insecticides such as 90%lindane granules mixed with sawdust (104, 108) or a mixture of 1 part gammabenzene hexachloride (50% wettable powder): 9 parts damp sawdust (125, 132) may be placed in the axils of the youngest4-5 fronds, but this is labor-intensive. Thesame

problemapplies to the pouring of dieldrin into holes drilled at one meter intervals along old oil palmtrunks to prevent developmentof larvae (110).
Owen(137) suggested that vegetative barriers could interfere with the beetle’s perception of palm crowns sought for feeding, conceal breeding sites, and provide a physical barrier to flight since they are clumsyfliers. In an experiment in Malaysia where O. rhinoceros was breeding in rubber logs, eleven monthsafter establishment of a bare groundplot, all stages except eggs totalled 52.5/0.40 hectare in bare groundand 9.3/0.40 hectare under dense legume cover, and they were more commonunder sparse than under heavy cover. Three months after establishment, the iacidence of severely damagedpalms was 28.4%, 9.4%, and 2.0%, and the incidence of undamaged palms was 35.4%, 48.7%, and 69.9%, on bare ground, with sparse cover, and with dense cover, respectively (180). Similar results were found whenrotting oil palmtrunks were covered with dense ground vegetation (181). Thusbreeding is restricted, frequency of attack on youngpalms is reduced, and the logs can be left lying flat in situ. Thecoverprovides an effective and inexpensive meansof controlling the pest during the critical early period of palm replanting. In the Ivory Coast the legume Pueraria javanica was used to cover windrowsof forest wood7-9 monthsafter felling and greatly reduced attacks on young coconuts (88).
Adult O. rhinoceros males were sterilized by a gammaray dose of 10,000 rads. The ratio of irradiated males to normals must be greater than 10: 1 to have any markedeffect on egg fertility (77), and this could militate against any sterile malerelease plan. Ninealkylating agents, derivatives of aziridine, had a sterilizing effect on malesbut tended to reducetheir longevity and thereby reduced their competitiveness comparedto normals. Tepa did not stop formation of mobile spermatozoa,but eggs laid by females that had mated with treated males ceased developmentat an early stage (78). A number of juvenile hormonemimics were shownto have an effect when applied topically or injected into young O. rhinoceros pupae. The most effective was methoprene(31).
USE OF BACULOVIRUS
Readers are referred to a forthcomingreview for a moredetailed treatment of this topic (17). Thevirus wasfirst discovered in O. rhinoceroslarvae in Malaysia and namedRhabdionvirusoryctes (69, 70). It has since been found throughout the Philippines, Sumatra, and west Kalimantan(191 ). It did not exist in any SouthPacific countries. It wasfirst observedin nuclei of larval fat body cells (69). Later it was found in nuclei of midgut epithelium larvae and adults (72, 140) and also in the adult ovarian sheath and spermatheca(117). It multiplies in nuclei of cultured larval O. rhinoceros heart

and blood cells (147) and moth (Spodoptera frugiperda) and mosquito (Aedes albopictus) cells (92). Thestructure of the virions (119, 140, 141, 153) indicates that it belongs to the baculovirus group. In infected larvae the abdomenbecomesturgid and glassy, the fat bodydisintegrates, and the amountofhemolymphincreases, so that the larvae appear translucent when viewedagainst light. Internal turgor mayincrease, extroverting the rectum. In the terminal phase chalky white bodies may appear under the abdominal integument(69). Muchvirus multiplication occurs in the midgutepithelium (140).
The lethal infection time for larvae that have eaten virus-contaminated mediumdepends on the instar: first instar larvae die after 9 days, second instar after 13 days, and third instar after about 23 days. Givensimilar doses by force-feeding, youngthird instar larvae died after 18 days, and old ones after 25 days (184). Hightemperatures speeded death (32°C comparedwith 25 or 27°C). The virus also killed second or early third instar larvae of S. a. grossepunctatus within 13-15 days of infection, but someolder larvae seemedto be resistant (4). In the Ivory Coast, larvae of O. boas showeda sensitivity to the virus that wassimilar to that of O. rhinoceroslarvae, but O. monoceroslarvae were muchless susceptible, so field trials were not undertaken (89). In the Philippines several strains of baculovirns were foundin O. rhinoceros that differed in their pathogeniceffects; someseemed to infect larvae moreeasily than the strain that originated in Malaysiaand was introduced to the South Pacific. Differences were also noted in the survival times of larvae after inoculation with different Philippine strains (191).
In adults virus multiplies in nuclei of midgutepithelial cells, and the gut eventually fills with disintegrating cells and virus particles (72, 120). Infected adults defecate virus into the surrounding medium(185). Thusadults are virus reservoirs, spreading infective virus into the insect’s natural habitats (72). Upto 0.3 mgvirus/day maybe producedin the feces of an infected adult (118). Diseased beetles generally showno external symptoms,but virus-treated breeding sites Monty(120) found nine beetles with malformed elytra, wings, or abdominalwail, and one of the beetles contained virus. HoweverZelazny (189) believes that virus is not normally carried over developmentfrom the infected larva to the adult stage. In the laboratory, infected adults died sooner (25 comparedwith 70 days) and laid fewer eggs than healthy controls (1.25 + 0.13 comparedwith 14.7 + 1.5 eggs/female) (185).
Virus is mass produced by feeding batches of healthy larvae on medium mixedwith macerated virus-killed O. rhinoceros larvae. The virus-packed cadavers are removeddaily and are deep-frozen for indefinite storage (11, 182). Storage of virus as macerated cadavers mixed in sawdust at 26°C reduced viral activity to 0.091%of its initial value in one weekand to

BIOLOGY OF PALM RHINOCEROSBEETLES 329
0.027%in two weeks; no activity was detectable after one month. Drying or warmingincreased the rate of inactivation (184). Safety testing with purified virus (49) showedno pathogenicity to eight tissue cultures (two humanand two pig cell cultures, and one each from mouse, hamster, fish, and calf) or to various organs of mice up to 60 days after inoculation. In laboratory studies (189) O. rhinoceros adults becameinfected per os in a mixture of sawdust and macerated virus-killed larvae, or whenkept together with virus-infected adults. Adults developing from larvae that had survived exposure to various dosages of virus were not infected, nor were larvae hatching from eggs that had been surface-contaminated with virus. Larvae hatching from eggs laid by infected females rarely were infected. Nevertheless, in adults virions have been found in the nucleus and cytoplasm of spermatids, in cells and lumens of accessory glands, and in the ejaculatory canal, as well as in chorionatedoocytesand follicle cells (116a). In O. rhinoceros populations the virus is transmitted mostfrequently during mating, possibly whenthe healthy partner contacts by .mouththe virus that has been defecated by the infected partner. It can be similarly transmitted wheninfected and healthy beetles feed together in palms. Beetles visiting larval breeding sites that contain freshly virus-killed larvae can become infected, and such beetles pass the infection to healthy larvae whenvisiting another breeding site (189).
Three methods of applying virus have been used, each superseded by the subsequent one as the modeof transmission becamemore clearly understood. The first methodinvolved placing up to 50 macerated virus-killed larvae in an artificial compostheap, whichwasthen visited by beetles that becameinfected as they crawled through it. Later they flew awayand spread virus elsewhere. These heaps had several disadvantages (11). Another methodwas to place virus-killed larvae and live infected ones under 6-10 one meter lengths of split coconut log, but disadvantages persisted (11). Finally it was found that the simplest, most economical, and most direct methodof virus dissemination wasto release laboratory-infected beetles, a methodintroduced early in 1972. Beetles are immersedfor 2-3 min in a suspension of 2 macerated cadavers/liter of water, then allowed to crawl for 24 hours throughabout 1 kg of sterilized sawdustmixedwith half a virus grub in 500 cm3 of water. Zelazny (190) obtained 90%infection by forcing beetles to swim for 10 min in a 10%suspension of macerated freshly virus-killed larvae. Beetles wereallowedto crawl under logs or into vegetation and fly off at night. Dispersingwidelybefore death, the beetles spread the disease directly into the wild population, and contaminated breeding sites that contained larval broodsand other beetles as well as palmcrowns.
Beetles used for testing maybe caught in attractant traps, and breeding sites maybe searched for live or freshly dead Oryctes material. Virus may be detected by the following methods: electron microscope observation of

virions in infected feces (118), histological examination(72, 120), immunological testing (26), bioassay method(184), adult midgut-content smear (49), and macroscopic examination of the adult midgut (49).
Introduced into artificial log heaps in WesternSamoain 1967, the virus becameestablished in the O. rhinoceros population in one year and spread to other parts of the islands (112). It apparently reducedthe beetle population considerably. However,lack of quantitative damagesurveys caused certain doubts and questions that stimulated work elsewhere. In 1969, 73% of larvae collected fromnatural breeding sites died of virus. However,it is nowknownthat the larvae were bulk-collected and cross contamination occurred. As a result, findings did not represent the mortality in the wild population (168); howeverthey sufficed to showthat the virus was established. Careful studies in 1970-1971showedthat in fact only about 3%of larvae and 35%of adults in the wild were infected, and a meanof 7.3% of breeding sites contained infected insects (186). Larval breeding sites were mostlikely to contain infected insects if the sites bore two broodsinstead of one, and if breeding wasextensive in the area. Sites were less frequently visited by infected than by healthy females. Matedfemales Collected from palmswere moreoften infected than egg-laying females frombreeding sites. Infections in males increased with age, but young females were more often infected than very youngor old females (186). From1971 to 1974breeding sites with infected larvae fluctuated between5.6 and 11.2%(average 8.2%) (190). Detailed surveys showedthat the pattern of 12.5 to 18%of fronds damagedseemed to follow these fluctuations most of the time. Between 1973and 1975the percentageof infected beetles in traps fell from63 to 35% (average 51%),whichcoincided with a significant decline in the number beetles trapped. Moremales than females were found to be infected.
In Fiji virus application began in 1970using the three methodsas they evolved (11, 15). Samplingin 1971-1972showedthat on the islands of Beqa and Vatulele 2-3 %of breeding sites contained infected specimens. Onthe main island of Viti Levu, the proportions of beetles found infected were 68%at Suva from January to March1974, 66%between Lautoka and Nadi from September 1973 to March 1974, and 57%at Caboni from June 1973 to February 1974. Trappings on numerousother islands sh~wed that the virus was established, and surveys before release and at later intervals showedthat in manylocalities damagefell significantly 12 to 18 months after virus establishment (Figure 1). OnWallis Island virus wasapplied artificial log heaps from September 1970 to June 1971. Less than two months after the program began, virus had spread over the whole island (57) and in one year the adult beetle population fell by 60-80%(59). percentage of fronds damagedfell by an average of 82%,ranging from 90% in densely planted groves to 76%in more open groves.

Virus was released into artificial sawdust heaps and log heaps on the western tip of Tongatapu, Tonga between November 1970 and January 1971 082). The epizootic spread about 3 km/month.Breeding sites with infected O. rhinoceros ranged from 2 to 40%, depending on time elapsed since release and on distance from the release point. Behind the zone of spread, the virus incidence fell again. In the release zone rapid damage surveys showedthat the palms had noticeably improvedat 350 days postintroduction of virus; according to the knownrate of frond replacement, a significant change in beetle numbersmust have occurred at about 200 days postintroduction. In the release zone, the numberof palms with central crown damagefell from 28%at 150 days postintroduction to 5%at 455 days, and in the next zone of spread from 27%to 10%. In AmericanSamoa virus-infected beetles werereleased at one site in early 1972(49) and damage declined as the virus spread at 0.8-1.6 km/month. The further the locations were from the release point, the later was the decline in damage
(187).
Viruswasintroducedto the TokelauIslands in artificial log heapsin 1967. An experiment to observe the effect of additional virus application was

begunin January 1973(190). Theislets of Nukunonuatoll, which lie in ellipse 8 × 13 km, were divided into two treatment groups and one control group. Notreatment wasapplied to the east and west control islets, which separated the treated north (90 hectares) and south (40 hectares) by kmto the east and 4.5 kmto the west. Onboth treated groups of islets beetles were caught with attraetant traps and larvae were collected every 2-3 months. Female beetles and larvae were killed, but male beetles were returned to the south islets in groups of 20/weekafter injection with hemolymph from infected larvae. The program continued for 20 months; damage to 1000 marked palms was recorded initially and after 23 months. On the control islets, damageincreased slightly. Onthose with beetle traps and larval collections, the number of beetles trapped fell from 240 to 149/month, and the numberof upper fronds damagedfell slightly from 3.7 to 2.4%.Onthe islets whereadditional virus application as well as trapping and larval collection took place, reduction in the numberof beetles trapped was significantly more pronounced (from 82 to 14 beetles/month); the decline started after 10 months, proportionately fewer females were trapped, and damage was significantly reduced (6.5 to 1.9% damaged fronds).
Virus applied in manure heaps in Mauritius from 1970 to 1972 (121) reduced the average numberof larvae per heap from 24.6 in 1970 to 4.6. in 1976-1977.Infected larvae were found in dead standing palms, indicating transmission by adults. Nomorevirus was released after 1972. Damageto palms was reduced by 60-95% (58). Nowthat the beetle population regulated by virus, perhaps the main way that damagecould be further reduced would be to decrease the beetles/palm ratio by increasing the overall numberof palms through replanting.
CONCLUDING REMARKS AND SUGGESTIONS FOP. FURTHER WORK
Further work should be undertaken on the effects of beetle attacks on coconutproduction in palmsof different ages, growingin different climates and on soils of differing fertility. Virus can assumean important, even primar~j role in integrated control programs, as it is successful and very attractive economically. It can be used in conjunction with cover crops to conceal breeding sites, or coconut timber utilization to reduce the number of sites. M.anisopliae spores can be applied as a microbialpesticide to large sawdust heaps around sawmills. As virus is soon inactivated, it can persist in an area only if somenatural breeding sites and an adequate O. rhinoceros population remain to propagate and transmit it.
BecauseMalysia was the source of the virus, it wouldbe of interest to mapits distribution and incidence in that country and its correlation with

beetle populations and damagelevels. Strains of the virus might be useful
in field releases against S. australis, and it could be tested on other Oryctes species such as O. gnu, O. centaurus, and the date pest O. elegans, as well as Papuana and Strategus species. If an unusually large numberof breeding sites is created locally, e.g. by felling of palms, the O. rhinoceros
populationcanresurgein these "outbreaka"reasandincrease damagteo neighborinpgalmsdespitethe virus. Long-terminvestigationsshouldexamine the valueof repeatedreleasesof virus-infectedbeetles in the outbreak areasas wasdonein Tokelau(190). Theislets of Nukunonaure smalland isolated, but onlargeislandsor landmasserseleasedbeetlescoulddisperse fromthe outbreakareas, thus diluting their etfeet. Thereis as yet no evidencethat O. rhinocerospopulationisn the SouthPacific are developing resistanceto the virus, but this possibility shouldbe monitoredN. ewvirus strains mayneedto be introduced.
