Work Plan 2015
Aubrey Moore, Ph.D. Associate Professor / Extension Entomologist
June 29, 2015

I was hired by the University of Guam on October 1, 2003 under a limited-term, split appointment (50% extension and 50% research). On June 26, 2008, I started a tenuretrack appointment as extension entomologist (100% extension) with the academic rank of Assistant Professor. I work in the Agriculture and Naturals Resources Unit of the University of Guam Cooperative Extension Service. I am also a faculty member of the Environmental Science Graduate Program and a member of the Western Paciﬁc Tropical Research Center. At the end of the 2012 fall term I applied for tenure and promotion and received both.
My current faculty role allocation is as follows: • 51% Extension and Community Activities • 34% Creative/Scholarly Activity or Research • 15% University and Community Service Tasks in this work plan for June 2015 through May 2016 are organized under these roles.

1 Extension and Community Activities
1.1 Diagnostic Services
As an extension entomologist, a major part of my job is providing insect identiﬁcation and pest control recommendations to a diverse clientele including commercial growers, gardeners, householders, GovGuam and federal agency personnel, and University of Guam colleagues. Most client contacts are initiated by a phone call or a visit by the client to the ANR oﬃce. In many cases identiﬁcation and pest control recommendations require a site visit by me and/or extension associates to collect samples and deﬁne the problem. The number of extension calls requiring my assistance averages approximately three per day.
I am not well trained as an insect taxonomist. To improve my skills, I attend insect identiﬁcation workshops whenever an opportunity occurs. In May, 2014, the US Forest Service sponsored my attendance at the Ambrosia and Bark Beetle Academy at the University of Florida.
1.1.1 Detection and Documentation of Invasive Species
As with any other tropical island, Guam is extremely susceptible to environmental and economic damage by invasive species. Despite this fact, Guam’s biosecurity is very weak and invasive species, many of them insects, are arriving at unprecedented rates. Bioinvasions are grossly under-reported for several reasons:
1. Professional capacity is lacking. Twenty years ago, there were 9 PhD level entomologists practising in Micronesia. Only 3 remain (Moore, Miller, Campbell), despite an increased workload largely due to arrival of the cycad scale, coconut rhinoceros beetle and little ﬁre ant and other invasive species of insects. UOG typically has 4 entomologists. We now have 2.
2. We suﬀer from the taxonomic impediment. The three remaining PhD level entomologists are generalists without the skills and resources for species determination. Timely and accurate species determination is a necessary ﬁrst step in response to a new pest invasion.
3. There is no ongoing biological survey of Guam with the goal of establishing a baseline biodiversity inventory and detecting newly arrived invasive species. Un-
5

1 Extension and Community Activities
fortunately, CAPS surveys are usually focused on demonstrating absence of speciﬁc agricultural pests rather than detecting new invasions.
4. Even when invasive species are detected and properly identiﬁed, ﬁrst island records are not documented and the information is not published in the scientiﬁc press.
In an attempt to improve this situation, I have set myself up as a registrar for new insect species arriving on Guam with the intent of properly documenting the ongoing bioinvasion of Guam. The procedure I am trying to establish is:
1. First detector sends me a digital image and/or specimen
2. Specimens are prepared and accessioned into the UOG insect collection
3. A fact sheet is prepared using a template for Guam New Invasive Species Alerts
4. The fact sheet is distributed to a list of stakeholders
5. Taxonomic assistance is obtained for an authoritative species determination.
6. A journal article is prepared and published in a refereed scientiﬁc journal. At this point the new geographical distribution data become available to the scientiﬁc community via the Global Biodiversity Facility (GBIF).
Although I have been able to generate about a dozen invasive species alerts over the past year (Section 2.4), only one new island record has made it into a peer reviewed journal (Moore, G. Watson, and Bamba 2014).
1.1.2 Insect Identiﬁcation Service for USDA-APHIS / Guam Customs and Quarantine Agency
I am often called upon to identify insect specimens intercepted the Guam Customs and Quarantine Agency. USDA-APHIS has certiﬁed me for this service and has provided a very oﬃcial looking badge to impress people with. (However, it is not quite as impressive as Dr. Millers bright red badge for getting onto the airport runways.)
USDA-APHIS has recently rewarded me for this service. In response to my 2015 Farm Bill suggestion, the agency kindly equipped me with two professional quality microscopes which will facilitate identiﬁcation of smaller insects and slide-mounted specimens.
1.2 University of Guam Insect Collection
The UOG insect collection is a valuable reference collection for extension entomology, teaching and research. I am a member of the board of directors for the collection and I work with Dr. Ross Miller to curate and catalog this collection.
To increase my knowledge of collection management, I attend the annual meetings of the Entomological Collections Network, which are typically held in conjunction with annual meetings for the Entomological Society of America.
6

1 Extension and Community Activities
I have a professional goal of building an online website to share all available information on Micronesian insects. This will include specimen level information for the collection complete with digital images and literature references. I built a digital catalog for the collection is using the BioLink Biodiversity Information Management System from CSIRO, Australia. The catalog currently contains 29,200 specimen records. BioLink is currently being redeveloped as an open source project (http://code.google.com/p/ biolink/). In am an active collaborator in this project. In July 2012 I published an article entitled Hosting a Biolink Database in the Amazon Web Services Cloud (EC2) on the project’s wiki ( http://code.google.com/p/biolink/wiki/BioLinkEC2).
I have built and evaluated two websites for serving information on Micronesian insect biodiversity, including specimen level data from the collection. One is a Drupal content management system template called LifeDesk provided the Encyclopedia of Life Project and the other is a similar template called ScratchPads provided by the Museum of Natural History in London. I am honored to have been selected as an advocate for ScratchPads as part of the project’s Ambassadors program (http://scratchpads.eu/ locate-scratchpad-ambassadors). Further information on my websites is provided in the Creative/Scholarly Activities section (2.5).
In March 2014 I travelled to Honolulu to attend the Biodiversity Collections Digitization in the Paciﬁc workshop sponsored by the Integrated Digitized Biocollections (IDigBio). I made an oral presentation entitled Evaluation of a Scratchpad Template as an Online Database for the University of Guam Insect Colletion at this workshop.
In May 2014 I met with Dr. Bob Foottit at the Canadian National Insect Collection in Ottawa to discuss progress and future directions for the UOG collection. Dr. Foottit is a member of the board of directors for the UOG Insect collection.
1.3 Guam Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle Eradication Project
This is currently my largest and most time consuming project. The coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) was ﬁrst detected on Guam in the Tumon Beach
hotel area on September 11, 2007. CRB is avery serious pest of coconut palms. Adult beetles may kill coconuts and other palms when they bore into the crowns to feed on sap. When CRB invaded Palau during the Second World War, it killed about half of all coconuts through the islands and totally exterpated the coconut palm from some of them. A delimitation survey indicated that the Guam infestation was limited to Tumon Bay and the adjacent Faifai Beach. In consultation with the Guam Department of Agriculture (GDOA), USDA-APHIS, and USDA-Forest Survey, it was decided to launch an eradication project.
I wrote the original eradication plan (available on-line at http://guaminsects.net/ uogces/kbwiki/index.php?title=Coconut_Rhinoceros_Beetle_Eradication_Plan) and this was funded by USDA and local funds. USDA provided funds under the condition that the poject was to be run under an Incident Command System with the
7

1 Extension and Community Activities
USDA-APHIS Guam Port Director as the federal commander, and the GDOA Director, or designee, as the local commander.
My original role was to provide scientiﬁc/technical support for the project, with the Guam Department of Agriculture (GDOA) providing project management with assistance from USDA-APHIS and USDA-Forest Service. However, it soon became apparent that GDOA had serious bureaucratic impediments which prevented hiring staﬀ and procuring supplies and equipment within a reasonable time frame. The eradication project directors, with the consent of the Dean, agreed to run project staﬃng, procurement, and ﬁscal management through the University. As a result, my role was expanded to include much of the project management. I am currently managing two grants which fund the project and supervise about 15 temporary employees. Report writing on current grants and proposal writing to keep the project in business occupies much of my time.
In December 2013, an infestation of CRB was detected on Hickam Air Force Base on Oahu. Roland Quitugua and myself were recruited as subject matter experts and spent a week in Honolulu advising an incident command team set up by APHIS. Later, we were both added to a national technical working group for CRB. My acitivities in support of the Hawaii CRB Eradication project are detailed in the Regional Collaboration section 1.3.3.
1.3.1 Activities:
1. Monthly Conference Calls. These teleconferences are with stakeholders, collaborators, and advisers in USDA APHIS and USDA Forest Service.
2. Project Websites. I have endeavored to share and archive data and information associated with the Guam CRB Eradication Project on-line. Prior to May 2009, I used a wiki site at http://www.guaminsects.net/uogces/kbwiki/index.php? title=Oryctes_rhinoceros. Afterwards, I used a Drupal site at http://www. guaminsects.net/anr/category/miscellaneous/coconut-rhinoceros-beetle. I maintain a bibliographic database of CRB-related journal articles at http: //guaminsects.myspecies.info/crb_biblio andresearch results are made available as on-line technical reports at http://guaminsects.net/anr/crb_tech_reports.
3. Project Database. Trapping data from a network of about 1200 traps, detections of CRB grubs or adults, and observations of CRB defoliation and bore holes are entered daily into a web-based georeferenced MySQL database which I designed. Data from this database is publicly accessible from a web page at http://www. guaminsects.net/anr/content/public-access-data-collected-guam-coconut-rhinoceros Links on this page enable the user to view trap catch data as a spatiotemporal display using a Google Earth animation or a chart of monthly totals. I use this system to produce monthly surveillance reports.
4. Collaboration. I have formed two collaborative research groups to do applied research aimed at controlling CRB damage. Dr. Sean Marshall and Dr. Trevor
8

1 Extension and Community Activities
Jackson at AgResearch New Zealand collaborate with me on biological control using oryctes nudivirus (OrNV) and CRB population genetics. Dr. Matthew Siderhurst and Dr. Eric Jang of USDA-ARS-PBARC collaborate with me on CRB trap improvement and CRB behavior.
1.3.2 Impediment
• My heavy workload does not permit enough time to prepare research results for publication in scientiﬁc journals.
1.3.3 Support for the Hawaii Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle Eradication Project
In December 2013, an infestation of CRB was detected on Hickam Air Force Base on Oahu. Roland Quitugua and myself were recruited as subject matter experts and spent a week in Honolulu advising an incident command system (ICS) team set up by APHIS. Later, we were both added to a national technical working group (TWG) for CRB. I built and maintain an online, full-text bibliographic for use by the TWG at http: //guaminsects.myspecies.info/CRB_biblio.
Frequent requests for scientiﬁc/technical information from the ICS, TWG and Hawaii Department of Agriculture (several queries per week) has signiﬁcantly increased my workload over the past several months.
Early in 2015, the directors of the Western IPM Center at UC Davis asked me to help organize a meeting to prioritize applied research needs for development of CRB IPM. I co-authored an agenda and attendance list with Arnold Hara and Roland Quitugua. The meeting took place at the Hawaii Department of Agriculture on April 3, 2015 and was chaired by WIPM Center Director Kassim Al-Khatib.
1.4 Western Plant Diagnostics Network
I am the UOG coordinator for WPDN. This organization provides ﬁnancial support for ANR’s Plant Diagnostic Laboratory, oﬀers First Detector Training workshops, and organizes identiﬁcation workshops for important pest groups. As coordinator, I am required to organize First Detector Training workshops, attend monthly conference calls, attend annual meetings, and provide reports. WPDN publishes newsletters for First Detectors, including the Paciﬁc Pest Detector to which I occasionally contribute (Table 1.1).

1.5 Guam Invasive Species Advisory Committee
(GISAC)
I am an active, founding member of this informal group of Guam’s biologists which meets irregularly about 6 times per year to discuss invasive species and what can be done to keep them out and mitigate the eﬀects of those that do invade the island. I worked with Dr. Russell Campbell and Diane Vice to develop an emergency response plan for invasive species detected on Guam.
A wiki site which I built for for GISAC was quickly adopted by the Western Micronesia Regional Invasive Species Council at http://guaminsects.net/gisac/index.php? title=Main_Page.

1.6 Public Outreach (Guest lectures, presentations, interviews)
During the reporting period I was interviewed numerous times by newspaper reporters, radio talk show hosts, and television news reporters. Most, but not all involved questions about the Guam coconut rhinoceros beetle eradication project. I helped to produce several fact sheets and articles for public print media.

1.7 Public Outreach (Internet)
During the past decade I published a lot of content on various websites. I have evaluated several current technologies for building a web presence for the Agriculture and Natural Resources Unit and the Drupal content management system seems to be a good ﬁt. This allows us to publish information for public access while keeping some documents private for internal use only. My print and online output are discussed in more detail in the Creative/Scholarly Activity section.
I maintain a website for the the UOG Cooperative Extension Service’s Agriculture and Natural Resources Program at http://guaminsects.net/ANR. I frequently post blog articles of public interest to this site (Table 1.2). I also maintain a website at http: //guaminsects.myspecies.info which is intended to facilitate sharing information on insects in Micronesia. I submit blog articles to this website which are more technical

2.5 Web Sites Designed and Maintained by Me
For the past several years, I have been searching for the “right” technology for providing on-line extension information. The features I want include:
• Ease of use, including immediate, on-line editing, so that colleagues and collaborators can create content
20

2 Creative/Scholarly Activities or Research
• Ability to display digital images at several resolutions • Full text search • Methods for handling on-line and oﬄine references • Fine grained security which protects client conﬁdentiality and allows for both pro-
tected, internal and public information sharing My current technology of choice is Drupal, a free, open source contents management system.
2.5.1 ANR Web Site.
Home page: http://guaminsects.net/anr This Drupal site is intended to facilitate sharing both internal and external information generated by the Agriculture and Natural Resources Unit of the University of Guam Cooperative Extension Service. This site is currently being used heavily by the Guam CRB Eradication Project. I also use this site for documenting ny diagnostics work. I provide a recent example web page documenting discovery of thrips in anthurium ﬂowers. (Evidence 2.5.1; available on-line at http://guaminsects.net/anr/content/thrips-damaging-anthu
2.5.2 Insects of Guam Web Site
Home page: http://guaminsects.myspecies.info This Drupal site is being evaluated for sharing information on Micronesian insects. Information will include include specimen level information from the UOG insect collection complete with digital images and literature references. It was built using a template developed by the Scratchpad project http://scratchpads.eu/ is sponsored by the European Institute of Distributed Taxonomy (EDIT) and the Natural History Museum in London . The ScratchPad project is celebrating the International Year of Biodiversity by highlighting a diﬀerent Scratchpad taxon every week. I was honored to have one of my pages, describing the indigenous bug, Leptocoris vicinus, highlighted during the week of April 18 to 24, 2010. (Evidence 2.5.2)
2.5.3 Micronesia Biosecurity Plan Review Web Site
Home page: MBP.GuamInsects.net This is a secure, private Drupal site developed to facilitate sharing information among those reviewing the Micronesia Biosecurity Plan.

2 Creative/Scholarly Activities or Research
2.5.4 Moodle Site for my AG 109 Insect World Course
Home page: http://campus.uogdistance.com/course/view.php?id=286 This site was my ﬁrst experence with Moodle, a content management system designed for teachers. I originally built it to provide on-line resources for my students, but later decided to open a few wikis to promote collaboration on laboratory exercises. I also kept track of grades using Moodle. Examples from this site include the course resource page (Evidence 2.5.3a; available on-line at http://campus.uogdistance.com/ mod/resource/view.php?id=7349) and a small PHP program I wrote to facilitate printing pinned insect specimen labels (Evidence 2.5.3b; available on-line at http: //tinyurl.com/insect-labels).
2.5.5 Knowledgebase Wiki for the UOG Cooperative Extension
Home page: http://www.guaminsects.net/uogces/kbwiki/index.php This was my ﬁrst attempt at building an extension website to facilitate collaborative content creation. Digital copies of all of ANR’s pest fact sheets can be found on this site. There is also a list of insect pests found on all major crops grown in Micronesia. I stopped maintaining this site in May, 2009 because the ANR site built with Drupal has more of the features I need. (Evidence 2.5.4)
2.5.6 Western Micronesia Regional Invasive Species Council Wiki
Home page: http://www.guaminsects.net/gisac/index.php Originally built for the Guam Invasive Species Advisory Council, this site was quickly adopted fo sharing regional information on invasive species by the Western Micronesia Regional Invasive Species Council. (Evidence 2.5.5)
2.5.7 Guam Insects Blog Site
Home page:http://blog.guaminsects.net/ I ran into recurring technical problems with this site which uses the WordPress content management system and have mor or less abandonded development and maintenance.
2.5.8 Life Desk Site for Micronesian Insects
Home page: http://micronesianinsects.lifedesks.org/ This site uses a Drupal template being developed by the Encyclopedia of Life Project. I evaluate it for sharing information on Micronesian insects, but decided that the Scratchpad template (number 2, above) had a better feature set for what I wanted to do.
