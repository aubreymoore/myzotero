Research in Support of the Guam Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle Eradication Project
Chicken Wire Escape Test
Prepared by Aubrey Moore University of Guam Cooperative Extension Service January 17, 2014∗
Escape rates were 92% and 28% for the uncovered pan and the chicken wire covered pan, respectively.
1 Methods
At 6:30 PM on January 12, 2014, two pan traps without UVLEDS, lures breeding materilawere set up next to each other in a large ﬁeld cage. 29 beetles were placed in left-hand pan and this was covered with chicken wire. 25 beetles were placed in the right hand trap and this was left uncovered. Beetles remaining in pans were counted at 9:30 PM.
2 Results and Discussion
21 of 29 beetles remained in the pan capped with chicken wire. 2 of 25 beetles remained in the uncovered pan. Escape rates were 92% and 28% for the uncovered pan and the chicken wire covered pan, respectively.
