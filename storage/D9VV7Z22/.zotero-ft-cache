Papua New Guinea isolates of Metarhiziam arzisopliae from the rhinoceros beetles, Scapanes

australis and Oryctes rhinoceros; the black palm weevil, Rhynchophorus bilineatus (Coleoptera);

and three other insect orders (Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, and Dermaptera) were all short-spored

(M. anisopliae var. anisopliae). Isolates from Scapanes were also pathogenic to Rhynchophorus

and Oryctes. When a Scapanes isolate was grown on brown rice and released into the frond axils

of young palms, 32% of dead Scapanes adults collected during the following 48 weeks were

infected compared to 1% in the control nonrelease palms. Some infection of Rhynchophoras also

occurred. infection in Scapanes but not Rhynchophoras also increased in a plot of palms adjacent

to the release zone. The rice inoculum could be recovered and the fungus reisolated up to 84 days

after release, but infection of Scapanes continued to occur after all trace of the inoculum had

disappeared. ‘!Z 1985 Academic Press. Inc.

In Papua New Guinea initial damage to coconut palms by rhinoceros beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) is frequently fol-
lowed by lethal infestations of the black palm weevil, Rhynchophorus bilineatus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), (Bedford, 1974), which Smee (1965) characterized as the most serious coconut pest in the country. Since Rhynchophorus usually attacks damaged tissue, control of rhinoceros beetle damage is vital for control of the weevil. The Asiatic rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros, is effectively controlled by the introduced Bacdovirus of Oryctes in many countries and this virus is now established in Papua New Guinea (Gorick, 1980). However, Gorick (unpubl.) was unable to infect adults of the indigenous rhinoceros beetle, Scapanes australis, with the virus. The currently recommended control method in Papua New Guinea

(Anonymous, 1983), and the Solomon Islands (Stapley, 1980) is to apply 6% a.i. gamma-HCH (Lindane) granules to the axils of the fronds at 3-month intervals or
less, but control is not complete. Scapanes is now a major pest of coconuts in Papua New Guinea and, since it attacks mainly young palms, its seriousness will probably increase as more old palms are replanted with new hybrid material.
The entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae has been much discussed as a biological agent for controlling rhinoceros beetles (Swan, 1974). In Tonga and Samoa, artificial “trap” breeding sites for Oryctes were sprayed with spores and very high levels of larval infection were noted (Marschall, 1980). Very little spread to natural breeding sites occurred, presumably because the insects died before emerging from the infected breeding sites. A decline

PRIOK AND AKURA

in palm damage was noted after release of the fungus in Tonga (Marschall, 1980) and Samoa (Young, 1974), but it was not clear if this was due to fungus-induced mortality or to the recently released Baculoviras (Swan, 1974; Young, 1974). Swan (1974) concluded that Metarhizirm had failed to initiate epizootics in Oryctes populations and had no future as a biological insecticide against Oryctes larvae. However, the possibility of applying the fungus to palms to control Scapanes or Oryctes adults has not been tested. In the work described in this paper, a locally collected isolate from Scapanes was applied to young coconut palms to investigate its effect on Scapanes under field conditions. Some laboratory inoculation experiments are also described. These were carried out with a view to increasing the pathogenicity of the fungus to the target insects as described by Timonin et al. (1980).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collection und culture of isolates. Collections of sporulating infected insects were made in East New Britain and New Ireland Provinces in the Papua New Guinea Islands Region. Isolations were made initially onto 2% malt extract agar (Oxoid), with streptomycin at 100 units/ml. In subsequent work a modification of Doberski and Tribe’s (1980) medium was found to be better. This consisted of 20 g/liter dextrose, 5 g/liter peptone, 5 mg/liter crystal violet, 0.3 g/liter chloramphenicol, and 0.14 g/liter cycloheximide (autoclaved separately), and 12 g/liter agar. Isolates were stored on slopes of 2% malt agar at 26°C. Spore lengths of 14 isolates were measured in distilled water.
For spore production, a modification of Latch’s (1976) medium was used: 20 g/liter dextrose, 10 g/liter peptone, 10 g/liter casein hydrolysate, and 12 g/liter agar.
For field release, an isolate from Scupanes was used that had already been shown to be pathogenic to Oryctes and Sca-

pawes in laboratory trials. Brown rice was precooked in the ratio of 1 kg rice:580 ml water until all the water was absorbed. It was then autoclaved for 30 min in 25 x 40-
cm “Glad” oven bags at 150°C. The bags were inoculated with an aqueous suspension of spores and incubated for 7 days before use.
Field release. Two- to five-year-old palms growing at Vudal Agricultural College near Rabaul were divided into five zones of unequal size containing a total of
563 palms. All recorded palms were numbered. Scapanes and Rhynchophorus damage at this site was severe and had al-
ready led to the loss of many palms, with some replanting. The release zone, containing 127 palms, was located at one end of the site. One hundred control palms were also numbered in a 6-year-old block at the Lowlands Agricultural Experiment Station, Keravat, 5 km distant from the release zone. Damage was very severe in this
block. Two surveys were made in the preceding
year to check the natural level of Metarhi,-iurn infection. In addition a pretreatment
survey of all the palms at the College was made on the day before the release. All dead insects were collected and microscopically checked for infection. These insects were not replaced in the palms. The control block at Keravat was not included in this survey.
The fungus was released in December 1981, by distributing 100 g rice inoculum per palm in the axils of every frond on
every palm in the release zone. Fortnightly recordings were made of all live, dead, and infected adult insects in every palm in the release zone, the adjacent nonrelease zone, the other nonrelease zones, and the control zone for 48 weeks after release. Dead and infected insects were marked with different colored pins. This enabled recorders to detect very recent infections which had not been visible at the time the insect was first recorded. During the postrelease counts, all

dead and infected insects were replaced where they were found so as not to remove the infection source from the field. One large section of the “other nonrelease zones” was not recorded from week 34 onward.
The fortnightly data were blocked into 12-week periods for analysis. The proportions of dead to infected insects in the three zones at the release site were compared with the proportion in the control zone using the chi-square test (Snedecor and Cochran, 1967).
Viability of the fungus inoculum after release. Three rice grains from each of 10 randomly chosen palms were collected at intervals after release and visually checked for Metarhizium. One grain from each palm was plated on modified Doberski and Tribe agar for confirmation.
Laboratory inoculation experiments on Scapanes, Oryctes and Rhynchophorus.
Inoculation experiments were carried out to check the pathogenicity of isolates and to try to increase pathogenicity and extend it to other target insects. Isolations were made from two infected Scapanes and two infected Rhynchophorus collected from the release zone after release of the original isolate. These isolates were used for reinoculation, and the fungus was then reisolated from infected weevils and used to inoculate beetles and vice versa. It was never possible to obtain enough insects for replicated experiments.
Adult Scapanes and Rhynchophorus (and Oryctes in one experiment) were inoculated by dipping them for 5- 10 set into aqueous spore suspensions prepared from cultures on modified Latch’s medium by flooding the colonies with 20 ml water plus one drop of Tween 20, brushing off the spores, and diluting to 500 ml. Spore concentrations were in the range 0.5- 1.5 x lo7 spores/ml. In one experiment, weevils were inoculated by scattering rice grains covered with sporulating fungus on the floor of the cage.

RESULTS
Collection and Culture of isolates
Metarhizium was readily isolated onto modified Doberski and Tribe’s agar. Colonies grew slowly and sporulated after 7-9 days. The only contaminants that were commonly encountered were Penicillium
SPP. All Papua New Guinea isolates from four
insect orders (Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Hemiptera and Dermaptera) were “shortspored” by Latch’s (1976) definition. Mean spore lengths ranged from 5.5 to 7.5 km (4.5-8 km). All these isolates conformed to Tulloch’s (1976) definition of Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae.
Cultures remained viable for I year on 2% malt agar. The fungus sporulated abundantly on modified Latch’s medium, producing a thick spore layer after 7 days. However, several isolates lost the ability to sporulate after one or two subculturings on agar.
Field Release
Only a single infected Scapanes and no infected Rhynchophorus were found at Vudal College in the two surveys made in the year preceding release, and none were found in the prerelease survey made the day before release. The 12-weekly totals of live, dead, and infected adults in the release, adjacent nonrelease, other nonrelease, and control zones are given in Tables 1 (Scapanes) and 2 (Rhynchophorrrs). The data are blocked from the fortnightly counts, and are actual numbers of insects rather than percentages because of the small numbers of insects recorded at each count.
The results in Table I show that, in the release zone, significantly more dead Scapanes adults were infected than in the control zone up to 36 weeks after release of the fungus. In the first 12 weeks, significantly more dead Scapanes were infected in the

adjacent nonrelease zone (50 m distant) as well. No increase in infection occurred in
the more distant nonrelease zones. The increase in infection in Rhynchophorus (Table 2) was much smaller, but in the 48-week total the proportion of dead adults infected was significantly higher in the release zone than in the control zone.
For both Scapanes and Rhynchophorus, a large number of live adults was recorded at every count. These were not marked, and it was not possible to determine how many of them contributed to the subsequent totals of dead and infected insects and how many escaped, but it is likely that some did escape. In preparing the live insect totals for Tables 1 and 2 it was necessary to assume that no live insects were counted twice. If this did happen, the real

totals of live insects would have been lower and the proportion of total insects infected would have been higher. Because of this uncertainty, no analysis was carried out on the live insect data.
There was a gradual decline in the number of live and dead (uninfected) insects recorded in all zones during the year. This may have been an artifact due to interference with the habitat caused by frequent sampling.
After 26 weeks, the release zone records were analyzed to determine the proportion
of palms that had been attacked by Scapanes (and Oryctes) and/or Rhynchophorus, and the proportion of palms in which Meturhizium infection had occurred (Table 3). Seventy-six palms (60% of the total) were visited by at least one Scapanes

during the 26-week period, and infected Scupane.s were recorded in nearly half of these.
Ninety-nine percbnt of all the rhinoceros beetles recorded in the course of the trial were Scapanes, further evidence for the importance of this pest in young palms.
Viability of the Fungus Inoculunz after Release
Rice grains were easily found in the frond axils up to 49 days after release, but were difficult to find after 84 days. By this time the wetter grains were disintegrating but the exposed and drier grains still had visible fungus on them. No grains were found after 140 days. The fungus was still visible in 70% of the grains collected at 84 days, and was fully viable in 100% of the grains plated on modified Doberski and Tribe’s agar.

Laboratory Inoculation Experiments on Scapanes, Oryctes and Rhynchophorus
Peaks in mortality due to infection occurred at 10 (6-24) days after inoculation (Scapanes) and 14 (7-30) days (Rhynchophorus). One isolate caused infection in 1.5 out of 22 Scapanes adults. Mortality to Rhynchophorus was low, ~20% for both isolates.
In the experiment where Scapanes isolates were inoculated onto Rhynchophorus and vice versa, both isolates were pathogenic to both target insects. One Rhynchophorus isolate caused mortality in 8 out of 14 adult Scapanes, but mortality was again low in Rhynchophorus. Slightly higher mortality was obtained in Rhynchophorus when adults were inoculated by scattering rice inoculum on the floor of the cages.

DISCUSSION
Latch (1976) found that “long-spored” isolates of M. arzisopliae (Tulloch’s M. unisop[iae var. major) were more pathogenic to Oryctes than most “short-spored” isolates (var. anisopliae), but some of the latter were pathogenic even though they were obtained from other insects. In Papua New Guinea all isolates collected from coleopterans and other orders were var. unisopliue. One isolate, obtained from Rhynchophorus after the field release, was as pathogenic to Scupanes as other Scapunes isolates. Thus, there seem to be possibilities both of increasing pathogenicity to Scupanes by “preconditioning” the isolates in the target insects (Timonin et al., 1980) and of obtaining an isolate pathogenic to more than one of them. However, if the latter proved difficult it would also be possible to release a mixture of isolates.
Mortality to Rhynchophorrls was low for all isolates when weevils were inoculated by the dipping method, but this method may not have been very effective due to poor retention of spore suspension on the insects’ cuticle. This might also explain

why high mortality (>75%) was not obtained with any of the target insects in the inoculations. It appeared that mortality in Rhynchophorrrs was higher when the in-
sects were continually exposed to the fungus in the cage as opposed to a single exposure by dipping.
For field release, a preparation of the fungus is required which will preserve it in
a sporulating and infective state for as long as possible; requirements which are well met in nature by infected cadavers. Rice autoclaved in heat-resistant plastic bags has been used as a substrate for Metarhizillm in Brazil (Aquino et al.. 1977). In
Tonga, Latch and Falloon (1976) found that the fungus remained infective in Oryctes
breeding sites for up to 2 years when released in an oat grain substrate. The brown rice inoculum released in this study was hard to detect after 12 weeks, and was un-
detectable after 20 weeks. However. infection continued to occur in the release zone after all traces of the substrate had disappeared, and these infections could not always be traced to infected cadavers. so it appears that the spores could still be present and infective after the substrate had
disintegrated. This indicates that infection may occur from few spores, which is supported by the demonstration that Scdytus adults can be infected by <IO0 Metarhi-
zirrm spores (Doberski, 1981). A previous study on Scupunes adults re-
corded 2% Meturhizium infection at a site 10 km from the release zone during the wet season (Bedford, 1974). This compares with 10-20s infection in Oryctes larvae in Samoa (Marschall, 1970) and 5- 10% infection in Oryctes adults in India during wet months (Nirula, 1955). It appears that the level of infection in Scapanes adults is normally low, at least in palms; the fate of adults after they leave the palms is uncertain. No infections in Rh:~nchophortrs have been recorded previously in the release area, although this pest has not been extensively studied.
In the release zone the proportion of

193

dead Scapanes and Rhynchophorus infected by Metarhizium rose substantially
after release. Levels of infection in Scapanes, but not Rhynchophorus, also increased in the adjacent nonrelease zone. This zone was 50 m from the release zone and on the other side of a road. No increase in infection occurred in the more distant nonrelease zones or in the control zone 5 km distant. No firm explanation for the spread of the disease can be offered, though it may have been due to newly infected insects migrating from the release zone.
Bedford (1974) commented that even a single Scapanes attack could allow a lethal infestation of Rhynchophorus to develop.
Thus, the apparently low number of insects recorded in the trial still represents a dangerously high level of infestation. The data in Table 3 indicate that. in the approximately 4-year period during which palms
are susceptible to Scapanes, most palms at the release site would suffer multiple attacks. The level of damage at the release site was very severe and would have been unacceptable in a commercial planting.
The data presented here indicate that Metarhizium may cause considerable mortality to Scapanes when applied to the palm leaf axils as a mycoinsecticide. However, a
commercially acceptable level of control was not achieved in this initial trial. Three possible ways of increasing its effectiveness are more frequent and larger applications of inoculum, and increasing the virulence of the fungus to the target insect by repeated inoculation and reisolation. The susceptibility of Rhynchophorzts to the same inoculum, which was not envisaged when
the trial was planned, also needs further investigation.
More work is needed to determine how many of the live insects recorded at each count contribute to the subsequent total of dead and infected insects and how many escape. It is not known precisely how long Scapanes adults spend in the crowns of coconut palms before emerging and flying away to breed, nor how rapidly infection

develops in the field-infected insects nor whether they may emerge from the palms
and fly to breeding sites before the infection becomes fatal. If this happened, infected adults might spread Metarhizium to breeding sites and contaminate them, which could make the fungus more effective in controlling the population.
