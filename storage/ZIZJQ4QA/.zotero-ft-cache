NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Despite the fact that Guam's forest ecosystems are rapidly being degraded by inva-sive insect species, such as the Asian cycad scale, Aulacaspis yasumatsui, the coconutrhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros, and the little fire ant, Wasmannia aurapunctata,little is known about Guam's forest insects and their impacts on forest health. Discoveryof three species of bark beetles not previously reported from Guam in a single trap at asingle location [Moore, unpublished] illustrates this lack of knowledge.Support is requested for a Guam forest insect survey which will fill some of the gapsin our knowledge base.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of the proposed survey is to build a knowledgebase on insects associatedwith plants in Guam's forests. The survey will result in a reference collection of Guam'sforest insects and a publicly available online database to facilitate sharing of specimendata, images and ecological associations among plants and insects.The knowledgebase will be usefull to natural resource managers responsible for main-taining the health of Guam's forests and to biologists trying to understand Guam'sterrestrial ecosystems in the wake of major biological invasions.
APPROACH: SamplingThe survey will extend beyond creating a species checklist. In addition to collectingand identifying insect specimens, associations among plants and other organisms will berecorded in a manner similar to what has been done for the pests of Cycas micronesica(Figure 1 in attached proposal).Insects associated with the 38 most abundant forest trees (Table 1) will be collectedin collaboration with the Guam Department of Agriculture's Forestry Division. Duringthe first year, insects associated with Guam's eight most predominant tree species willbe surveyed (identified in the table as group 1 in attached proposal). Ten tree species will be surveyed ineach of the following three years (groups 2, 3, and 4 in attached proposal).Insects associated with rare plants in Guam's forests will be surveyed in collaborationwith the Guam Plant Extinction Prevention Program (GPEPP) [GPE, 2014]. Recentlyarrived insect species are undoubtedly putting these plants at an increased risk of ex-tinction as illustrated by the recent discovery of a new armored scale insect attackingSerianthes nelsonii saplings [Moore et al., 2014].A workshop on sampling methods will be offered to collaborators at the start of theproject. Topics to be covered will include data requirements, photo-documentation,GPS, and rearing adults from field collected larvae. When possible, larval insects willbe reared to the adult stage to facilitate identification and to collect parasitoids.TaxonomyThe assistance of professional taxonomists will be required to accurately identify manyof the insects collected by this survey. Project funding will be used to support anexisting collaboration with Dr. Richard Zack, Director of the M. T. James EntomologicalCollection at Washington State University and also a director of the University of GuamInsect Collection. Project funds will be used for annual visits to Guam by Dr. Zackduring which he will assist with and provide expert advice on collection, identificationand curation of forest insect specimens in the UOG Insect Collection.Voucher specimens will be kept in the University of Guam Insect Collection. Theproject will support a part-time collection technician.ReportingAll project data will be stored in a modern, on-line, open-access biodiversity database.It is anticipated that several new island records, including some new invasive species,will be discovered during the survey. A Guam New Invasive Species Alert will be postedfor each new invasive species and each new island record will be documented in a peer-reviewed scientific note.
KEYWORDS: Guam, forestry, invasive species, native plants
PROGRESS: 2016/10 TO 2017/09 Target Audience:I provided information to the general public and NGOs such as the Guam Plant Extinction Prevention Project, and government agencies such as the USDA-APHIS, US Forest Service, and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. This information includes identification of insect specimens given to me and recommendations on plant protection. Fact sheets on newly arrived invasive species were prepared and made available to the public in print and on web sites which I build and maintain. As one of only 3 practicing PhD-level entomologists in Micronesia, I provide entomological services to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Many, if not most, of current insect problems in Micronesia involve damage to forests by recently arrived invasive species. Changes/Problems: Nothing Reported What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?At the 2017 Pacific Island Forestry Professionals Workshop, I provided training and professional development to about 50 participants from American affiliated Pacific Islands. Here's an outline of the topics I covered during the 4 hours of presentations: Concurrent Session 1B: Forest Health Protection: Entomology Tuesday afternoon, April 4, 2017 3rd Floor Unnai Ballroom 3, Westin Hotel, Tumon Bay, Guam Presentations Introduction Biological Invasion of Guam Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle Asian Cycad Scale Little Fire Ant Emerging Forest Insect Pest Issues in Micronesia Access to Information on Forest Insect Pests in Micronesia Using free Cell Phone Apps for Forest Pest Surveys Open Discussion How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest?I published presentation slides and other resources associated with the entomology section of the 2017 Pacific Island Forestry Professionals Workshop on an Open Science Framework Web Site at https://osf.io/a6t7v/. What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals?During the next reporting period I will focus on building an online database of Guam's forest pest insects and the plants they attack. This is part of a larger project to assmble a biodiversity inventory for terrestrial organisms on Guam.
IMPACT: 2016/10 TO 2017/09 What was accomplished under these goals? My major accomplishment during this reporting period was organizing a forest entomology section for the 2017 Pacific Island Forestry Professionals Workshop at the request of the USDA Forest Service.

PROGRESS: 2015/10/01 TO 2016/09/30 Target Audience:I provided information to the Guam Plant Extinction Prevention Project staff and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service staff at the Guam National Wildlife Refuge. This information included identification of insect specimens given to me and recommendations on plant protection. Fact sheets on newly arrived invasive species were prepared and made available to the public in print and on web site. Changes/Problems:Progress on this project was slow during the reporting period because the PD was focused on finding a solution to the an outbreak of a coconut rhinoceros beetle biotype (CRB-G) which has escaped from biological control by Oryctes nudivirus which has previously quelled CRB outbreaks on Pacific Islands. What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?Informal training in insect specimen collection and preservation was provided to staff of the Guam Plant Extinction Prevention Pogram (GPEPP) during several visits to the project's nursery and field sites. In some cases, pest control recommendations were provided. How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest?Fact sheets on newly arrived invasive insect species were prepared and these are available to the public in print and on-line. What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals? USDA Forest Service has asked the PD to organise a forest insect workshop as part of a regional forestry meeting they are sponsering on Guam during April 2017 I plan to submit two refereed journal articles on recently arrived bark beetles species. I plan to host a visiting taxonomist to help identify a large backlog of unidentified specimens submitted to the University of Guam Insect Collection. If money is available, a student technician will be hired to coincide with the taxonomist's visit. I plan to migrate the University of Guam Insect Collection database from Biolink, a legacy biodiversity DBMS, to Specify to facilitate sharing data via GBIF. I will continue to populate the populate the Check List Plus database which will list all of Guam's forest insect pests, their host plants, and their biocontrol agents. This database will be made available on-line.

IMPACT: 2015/10/01 TO 2016/09/30 What was accomplished under these goals? A web application named CheckList Plus (CLP) was designed and developed to faciliate databasing and accessing information on Guam's forest pests. All organisms in CLP are linked to taxa in the taxonomy database maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The NCBI taxonomy database is essentially a digitized tree of life which includes scientific names and synonyms including common names. Unlike many biodiversity databases, CLP allows definiton of trophic links between taxa. This allows queries to find all insect herbivores which feed on a particular host plant, or conversely, to find all host plants on which a particular insect feeds. The CLP is currently being populated with data from several sources: the scientific literature and specimen data from the University of Guam Insect Collection. Data from scientific literature are being mined using the Plazi Golden Gate Imagine Editor. Preparations are being made to migrated the University of Guam Insect Collection database from Biolink, a legacy biodiversity DBMS, to Specify to facilitate sharing data via GBIF. Many specimens of forest insect pests collected by the Guam Plant Extinction Prevention Program, the Guam National Wildlife Refuge, and other collaborators were accessioned into the University of Guam Insect Collection during the reporting period. Most of these specimens await identification by a taxonomist. During the 2016, taxonomic help was solicited from visiting insect taxonomists. Dr. Joshua B. Dunlap and Dr. Mary Liz Jameson, Department of Biological Sciences, Wichita State University, Kansas went through all of Scarabidae. Dr. Peter Maddison, PestNet, New Zealand, an expert on Pacific insects, spent about a week identifying unknowns.

PROGRESS: 2014/11/28 TO 2015/09/30 Target Audience:I provided information to the Guam Plant Extinction Prevention Project staff and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service staff at the Guam National Wildlife Refuge. This information included identification of insect specimens given to me and recommendations on plant protection. Fact sheets on newly arrived invasive species were prepared and made available to the public in print and on web site. Changes/Problems:A planned visit by an insect taxonomist to assist in identification of a large backlog in the University of Guam Insect Collection did not happen during the reporting period because of schedualing problems. A visit by a taxonomist is being planned for 2016. What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?Informal training in insect specimen collection and preservation was provided to staff of the Guam Plant Extinction Prevention Pogram (GPEPP) during several visits to the project's nursery and field sites.
