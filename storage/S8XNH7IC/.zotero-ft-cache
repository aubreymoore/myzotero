The problem of invasive species affects every person on Guam, and likewise the prevention, recognition and control of invasive species should also involve everyone on Guam.

First, as private citizens or businesses perhaps the best thing we can do is to scrupulously obey the established laws and regulations that are designed to keep invasive species from entering the island, and to declare anything questionable to customs officials when arriving on island from abroad.

Secondly, private citizens and businesses should keep their eyes open for plants, animals, insects or diseases that may be new to Guam, and if they suspect they are seeing something new should report them to the professionals at the Department of Agriculture or the University of Guam's College of Natural and Applied Sciences at 735-2001. Coconut rhinoceros beetle, little fire ant, and great banded hornet were all first reported to authorities who then identified the problem and initiated control measures.

Third, it seems to us that the government of Guam bears the responsibility of controlling invasive species on public property while the military bears the same responsibility for Department of Defense lands.  Similarly, private landowners bear the responsibility for dealing with pest problems on their property. While the Department of Agriculture and UOG can provide information on the identification and how to control pests, activities on private property should be dealt with by the land or business owner, and there are numerous pest control companies on the island that provide this service for a fee. Public entities such as UOG or GovGuam do not and should not interfere with or compete with these businesses.

There are several things that GovGuam can and should do to enhance invasive species recognition, interdiction, and control.

First, funds that accumulate from assessments on cargo and which by past legislation are dedicated to enhancing biosecurity of Guam, must be made available and reserved only for that purpose. With the pot of money set aside for biosecurity issues accumulating and unable to be used due to GovGuam’s legendary red tape, we suspect that the sharks within GovGuam are circling as they scent blood in the water.

Furthermore, the Biosecurity Division of the Department of Agriculture and Guam Customs is severely understaffed and ill-equipped.  This results in part from the inability to access and use funds set aside within GovGuam to hire personnel, purchase detection and identification equipment, and construct secure inspection facilities at the Port of Guam as was originally intended.  For example, the Plant Inspection Facility at the Guam International Airport has never been fully staffed on the Guam or federal side since its inception and the replacement of the GovGuam Biosecurity Division head after his retirement has dragged on for months. There is also a need for highly trained specialists in the region. At present there are two full-time active Ph.D. level entomologists in Micronesia, both housed within the land grant program at UOG.  Twenty years ago there were nine Ph.D. entomologists in Micronesia.  As these highly trained professionals retire or move on, they must be replaced.
