Hypolimnas octocula marianensis Fruhstorfer 1912, commonly referred to as the Mariana eight spot butter⬚y or the Mariana forest ⬚icker, is a subspecies of nymphalid butter⬚y recorded only from the islands of Guam and Saipan in the Mariana Islands. Because of its rarity and limited distribution, this subspecies became a candidate for listing under the United States Endangered Species Act in 1997. The objective of this article is to review what is currently known about this rare subspecies.
1 Taxonomy
Hypolimnas octocula is one of four species of nymphalid butter⬚ies inhabiting the Mariana Islands including H. bolina, H. anomola, and Vagrans egistina. H. bolina and H. anomola are common. However, V. egistina is very rare, not having been observed since the 1970s (Schreiner and Nafus, 1997). As with H. octocula marianensis, V. egistina became a candidate for listing under the United States Endangered Species Act in 1997.
The subspecies Hypolimnas octocula marianensis was described by Fruhstorfer (1912). The parent species, Hypolimnas octocula was described under the name Diadema octocula by Butler in 1869. In addition to H. o. marianensis, there are several other subspecies occupying islands of Palau, Vanuatu, New Caledonia and the Loyalties, Fiji, Tonga, and Samoa (Samson 1986).
Samson (1986) revised the Hypolimnas octocula complex. He split the group into two species, H. octocula and H. arakalulk. In H. arakalulk, he placed only two subspecies, both from Micronesia: H. arakalulk marianensis from the Marianas and H. arakalulk arakalulk for Palau. However, in this article I will use Hypolimnas octocula marianensis as the valid name.
This scienti⬚c name for the Mariana eight spot butter⬚y is often mispelled (Table 1). The most egregious error occurs in a U.S. National Park Service document (Haysmith et al., 2005), available online, where the authors mispelled all three components of the trinomial, ⬚Hypolymnus octucula mariannensis ⬚, and used this name in the caption for a photograph of a butter⬚y taken on Rota, which is outside the known range for H. o. marianensis. The butter⬚y in the image is clearly a female H. bolina, a common species in the Marianas. This misidenti⬚ed image was reused in a fact sheet on the Marianas eight spot butter⬚y published as part of the Guam Military Buildup Draft Environmental Impact Statement (Volume 9, Chapter 2, ).
A valid scienti⬚c name can be considered to be a key which unlocks the global information base for a taxon. Information associated with mispelled or otherwise invalid names may be inaccessible or overlooked. This is especially true for information stored in databases which use valid scienti⬚c
1

names as unique identi⬚ers. A recent attempt to use databases to assess the relationship between rare species and invasive species illustrates this problem. Roberts et al. (2013) have developed an innovative strategy were they use bibliographic database queries to extract information to be used in a massive literature review aimed at assessing the relationships between invasive species and threatened species. To extract information on threatened species, they used a query based on scienti⬚c names from lists provided by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Unfortunately, the name currently listed for H. o. marianensis is mispelled (H. o. mariannensis ). So it is likely that only literature keyed to this particular misspelling of the scienti⬚c name will be identi⬚ed for the review, and literature which uses the valid scienti⬚c name, synonyms, or other misspellings will be ignored.
2 Observations and Distribution
Here I attempt to list all known known observation and collection records for H. o. marianensis. Both H. o. marianensis and its synonym, H. o. arakalulk (mispelled as ⬚arakaluk⬚), are listed
by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). There are currently no occurrence records available for this subspecies, although there are records for other subspecies of H. octocula.
2.1 Type Specimens - Saipan (n=2)
According to Samson (1986), locations of the type specimens for H. o. marianensis are unknown. He examined a neotype and an alloneotype, both collected on Saipan:
Neotype, male, Museum Paris, Saypan (Mariannes), M. A. Marche, 200-83 (BM); Neallotype, female, Saipan, Mariana Isl., July 30, 1920 (AMNH).
These are the only Saipan collection records I was able to ⬚nd. There are no specimens of H. o. marianensis in the Northern Marianas Islands insect collection housed at the Northern Marianas College on Saipan (Schreiner and Nafus (1996)).
2.2 Swezey Collection - October 17, 1936 - Guam (n=1)
Swezey (1942) collected a single female H. o. marianensis during his 1936 entomological survey of Guam. The collection data are reported as ⬚Piti, from hibiscus at residence, Oct. 17, Swezey⬚. This specimen is in the Bishop Museum collection.
Some authors infer from the fact that Swezey collected only a single specimen of H. o. octocula that this subspecies was rare in 1936. However, this may not be the case. Swezey's mission on Guam was an agricultural pest survey (Swezey and Association, 1942; IMMS, 1943) and presumably he did not spend much time and e⬚ort collecting in karst habitats inhabited by H. o. marianensis and its host plants. The single adult specimen he collected was caught opportunistically while feeding on Hibiscus nectar at Swezey's temporary residence in Piti (Samson, 1986)
2.3 Muniappan Collection - 15 and 20 August, 1975 - Guam (n=3)
As reported by Samson (1986), Muniappan reared 3 butter⬚ies from ⬚larvae collected on limestone forest plant, Procris sp. at Hilaan Point, 15 and 20 August, 1975⬚. Specimens are in the University of Guam insect collection.

2.4 Schreiner and Nafus Surveys - 1995 - Saipan (n=0), Rota (n=0), Guam (n > 6)
Schreiner and Nafus (1996) surveyed for H. o. marianensis on Saipan, Rota and Guam during 1995. Early in the survey they discovered that the larvae fed upon Elatostema calcareum (tupun ayuyu) in addition to the previously known larval host plant, Procris pendunculata. Both are forest herbs in the family Urticaceae growing on karst limestone. For each site where the plants were found, 200 stems of Procris and 200 stems of Elatostema were searched, or as many as were available.
2.4.1 Saipan
H. octocula was not found on Saipan. Procris was located along the base of the cli⬚ line going around from Suicide Cli⬚ to Kalebrera Cave. Several large stands were located. However no sign of adult or larvae could be found. No specimens were found in the fairly extensive collection of butter⬚ies in the Northern Mariana Islands Insect Collection.
2.4.2 Rota
Although no butter⬚ies of this species have ever been collected on Rota, Schreiner and Nafus searched several sites, as Rota has not been collected as extensively as Guam and Saipan. Elatostema was abundant behind the Japanese gun on the way up to the Sabana, and at similar cli⬚-backed sites at that altitude and slightly higher. Procris occurred at some of these locations. Although chewing of the plants was noted, this appeared to be caused by the green caterpillar of a noctuid moth. No evidence of H. octocula was found.
2.4.3 Guam
On Guam, a number of sites along the northern half of Guam were searched. Procris and occasionally Elatostema occur on the windward side in patches in limestone forest in a narrow band about 200 ft above sea level. Both Elatostema and Procris occurred on the leeward side in forests perhaps 100-200 ft. above sea level. At all locations where the host plants were found at least one of the stages of H. o. marianensis was also found. The most butter⬚ies seen in one day at a suitable location was six. They found no eggs at most sites, but up to 71 at one site which was undergoing a small outbreak. Eggs and larvae were more abundant on Elatostema on the leeward side. Schreiner and Nafus did not search patches of host plants which are thought to occur in patches of limestone forest on the Southern mountains.
One site, below the University of Guam, was surveyed intensively for one year. See the Biology section below for results from observations at this site.
Schreiner and Nafus (1996)do not clearly indicate the total number of adult H. o. marianensis observed during their surveys. In a table of adult butter⬚y sightings, they list a total of 6 sightings: 3 individuals at Spanish Steps, Orote on 29-JUN-1995, 2 individuals at Tweed's Cave on 24-JUL1995, and 1 individual at Lower Pagat on 2-AUG-1995. However, this table does not include any sightings at the site near the University of Guam campus in Mangilao and elsewhere in their report, they state that ⬚The most butter⬚ies seen in one day at a suitable location was six.⬚

Bob Okoniewsky emailed excellent images of an adult H. octocula marianensis to me in April, 2008. This individual accidentally ⬚ew into the passenger compartment of his vehicle as he was driving on Andersen Air Force Base, Yigo, Guam.
2.7 Hawly and Castro Survey - June - October, 2008 - Tinian (n=0)
Hawly and Castro (2008) surveyed Tinian for H. o. marianensis, even though the subspecies has never been reported from this island. They located populations of Elatostema calcareum at four locations and monitored these plants for all H. o. marianensis life stages Each identi⬚ed host plant site was visually scanned for life cycle stages (eggs, caterpillar, chrysalis, and imagoes/adults) by one or two observers for up to two weeks at various time of the day. At Japanese Cave site-2, 2 caterpillars and 4 chrysalises of Hypolimnas bolina were found feeding and pupating on E. calcareum, the chrysalises were reared in the lab for con⬚rmation.
Two butter⬚y bait traps (lip type obtained from BioQuip.com) were set at each host plant site for up to two weeks. The butter⬚y bait traps were re-baited every three days with locally obtained mashed, rotting bananas, a liberal dose of raw cane sugar, and a dash of water. The bait was prepared on the afternoon prior to the morning of use and typically became well fermented prior to being placed in the ⬚eld. The traps were positioned within 5 meters of a host plant cluster and at approximately 3-4 meters above the ground.
After 4,806 documented minutes (approx. 80 hours) of visual searching and 1,848 documented trap hours (approx. 77 days) during the months of September and October, 2008 no life cycle stage of either species was observed.
2.8 Vegetation Survey 1 - 2008 - Guam (n=1)
A military contractor reported a sighting of an adult H. o. marianensis while doing vegetation surveys in the Pagat area of Yigo, Guam (Duenas 2010).
2.9 Vegetation Survey 2 - 2009 - Guam (n=0)
In a vegetation survey in at Andersen AFB in which ⬚the speci⬚c task was to document the presence of host plants for butter⬚y species that are candidates for the Endangered Species Act, no H. o. marianensis butter⬚ies were observed (TEC Inc. (2010)).
2.10 Andersen Air Force Base Butter⬚y Survey, Sept. 28 - Oct. 2, 2009 and Jan. 25, 2010 - Jan. 31, 2010 - Guam (n=0)
A survey for the Mariana Eight-Spot Butter⬚y, H. o. marianensis, was conducted on three Department of Defense parcels on Guam: Andersen Air Force Base (AAFB), Andersen South and Navy Barrigada during late 2009 and early 2010(AECOM Inc., 2010).
The survey used two methods: timed counts and baited traps. Timed counts were conducted along linear transects within each of the three parcels. At every 30 meters two scientists would stand back-to-back and enumerate observations of all butter⬚y species within a 5-minute period. The areas investigated along the transect consisted of 20 m diameter circle plots. The biologists communicated with each other frequently throughout the survey period so as not to count the same individual butter⬚y twice. A total of ⬚ve transects were studied. Three transects were located on AAFB and one transect was located on Andersen South and Navy Barrigada. [The report refers
5

to ⬚gures which show the locations of the transects. However, these ⬚gures are missing from the Natural Resources Survey Report (NAVFAC, 2010).]
Two baited traps were placed on each transect during daylight hours. The bait consisted of a mixture of mashed ripe bananas, apple cider, sugar, and yeast. At the end of the trapping period, which lasted approximately 6 hours, the traps were checked, and captured butter⬚ies were noted and then released.
There were no observations of H. o. marianensis during this survey. Presence or absence of host plants was not reported.
2.11 Campora Survey - Pagat - 2010, Guam (n=1)
A survey for all life stages of the Mariana Eight-Spot Butter⬚y, H. o. marianensis, and its two host plants along three transects in the Route 15 - Pagat Village area of Yigo, Guam from July 15 to July 24, 2009 (NAVFAC Paci⬚c, 2010).
Transects were ⬚rst surveyed over their entire length for host plants. Once the most probable areas of butter⬚y habitat (i.e. areas with a high density of host plants) were identi⬚ed, e⬚orts were then focused on those sites. This consisted of searching host plants for eggs, larvae, and pupae, monitoring the understory and upper forest canopy for adults, and monitoring bait pans. A digital camera (Canon 30D) was used to capture images of host plants and all butter⬚y life stages. Field binoculars were used to identify adult butter⬚ies from long distances. Bait pans consisted of aluminum pie tins and were suspended approximately ⬚ve to six feet from the ground. Banana and pieces of ⬚sh were used as bait. Bananas were prepared one day in advance by mashing and mixing with cane sugar and water and leaving at room temperature in a sealed bag for 24 hours. Fish pieces were obtained from a local market and placed in bait stations on the same day of purchase. Three bait pans were used in each area of butter⬚y habitat for a period of two days.
A single adult male H. o. marianensis was observed and photographed at the same location on consecutive days on a transect near the Route 15 North transect near the Yigo race track.
A total of 7 Hypolimnas larva were found at 5 di⬚erent locations on both E. calcareum and P. pedunculata. Hypolimnas eggs were found only on E. calcareum, with a total of 19 eggs at 5 di⬚erent locations. One viable Hypolimnas chrysalis was found on E. calcareum, and three empty Hypolimnas chrysalides were found on P. pedunculata. These immatures were probably H. o. marianensis. However, this could not be de⬚nitely con⬚rmed in the ⬚eld. H. octocula eggs and caterpillars are very similar to those of H. bolina and H. anomola which are common on Guam. Note that H. bolina has been observed to feed on E. calcareum (Hawly and Castro, 2008).
All of the 19 eggs where black, indicating that they were parasitized.

3 Biology
Most of what is known about the biology of H. o. marianensis comes from Schreiner and Nafus (1996), an unpublished report of rare butter⬚y surveys on Guam, Saipan and Rota. During these surveys, they found H. o. marianensis only on Guam, at several sites. One site, below the University of Guam was surveyed for one year. Butter⬚ies were most abundant between December and February. These months include the end of the rainy season and the beginning of the dry season on Guam. Population levels were very low in July and August, the beginning of the rainy season.
3.1 Larval Host Plants and Feeding Habits
Early in their surveys, Schreiner and Nafus found that larvae fed upon Elatostema calcareum (tupun ayuyu) in addition to the previously known host, Procris pedunculata. Both are forest herbs in the family Urticaceae growing on karst limestone. Schreiner and Nafus (1996) noted a tight association in occurrence of the butter⬚y and its host plants: ⬚At all locations where the host plants were found at least one of the stages of H. octocula was also found.⬚
⬚In Guam, a number of sites along the northern half of Guam have been searched. Procris and occasionally Elatostema occur on the windward side in patches in limestone forest in a narrow band about 200 ft above sea level. Both Elatostema and Procris occurred on the leeward side in forests perhaps 100-200 ft. above sea level. At all locations where the host plants were found at least one of the stages of H. octocula was also found. The most butter⬚ies seen in one day at a suitable location was six. We found no eggs at most sites, but up to 71 at one site which was undergoing a small outbreak. Eggs and larvae were more abundant on Elatostema on the leeward side. Still to be searched are patches of these plants which are thought to occur in patches of limestone forest on the Southern mountains.⬚
3.2 Life Cycle
Schreiner and Nafus (1996) provide developmental times for eggs and six instars of H. o. marianensis caterpillars (Table 2). The length of time spent as a pupa and longevity of adults is unknown.
3.3 Stage Speci⬚c Survivorship
Schreiner and Nafus (1996) made repeated observations of individuals in the ⬚eld until they changed to the next life stage or disappeared (Table 2). They used recovery rates as lower bound estimates of stage speci⬚c survivorship. Only 10 per cent of individuals observed as eggs where recovered as ⬚rst instar caterpillars. Schreiner and Nafus attribute this low rate to egg predation by ants and egg parasitism by hymenopterans (see below). Recovery rates for larval instars two to ⬚ve ranged from 44 to 88 per cent. However, the recovery rate for sixth instar caterpillars was only 29 per cent. Schreiner and Nafus attribute this low rate to the dispersal of the large sixth instar caterpillars when they are searching for food or a cryptic location for pupation.
3.4 Predation and Parasitism
In their year-long study of the H. o. marianensis population near the University of Guam campus in Mangilao, Schreiner and Nafus found that egg predation, probably by ants, and egg parasites killed the majority of eggs. Parasitized eggs were brought to the laboratory and reared. Except for two eggs which produced Ooencyrtus sp., all the eggs were parasitized by a Telenomus sp. In contrast to the Mangilao site, however, eggs recovered from other sites did produce Ooencyrtus sp.

They suspected that these were the same native species of wasps observed attacking H. anomala and H. bolina eggs. No egg, larval or pupal parasites which are known to have been introduced for biological control purposes were recovered.
The Guam Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy (DAWR, 2005) lists ⬚predation of caterpillar by an ichneumonid wasp⬚ as a threat to H. o. marianensis. I was unable to ⬚nd any other reference for H. o. marianensis caterpillars being attacked by ichneumon wasps, which are parasitoids, not predators.
4 Conservation
When planning an e⬚ective conservation strategy, one must ⬚rst collect enough information about the threatened taxon to understand and prioritize risks to be mitigated. Unfortunately, except for Schreiner and Nafus's year long study of a population of H. o. marianensis near the University of Guam Schreiner and Nafus (1996), our knowledge of this rare butter⬚y is limited to data from accidental sightings plus presence/absence surveys with some observations on association with the two known host plants.
The Guam Department of Agriculture Division of Aquatic and Wildlife Resources and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service have independently developed published threat assessments and conservation recommendations for H. o. marianensis Both are brief enough to be quoted here.

Threat Assessment and Recommendations from the Guam Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy (GCWCS) (Quoted verbatim from
DAWR (2005))
Threats:
Habitat loss for the host plants by introduced plant species, and predation of caterpillar by an ichneumonid wasp, are believed to be causes of this species rarity. ...
Action Plan: Habitat degradation and loss: Identify and map occurrences of Procris pe-
dunculata. Reduce impacts of ungulates and invasive plants in limestone forests areas where Procris occurs.
Small or extirpated population: Conduct monthly surveys at the Hilaan
Point to observe seasonal activity for this butter⬚y species, and cultivate caterpillars of this species and rear them to adult stage in a parasite and predation free enclosure for propagation. Release reared in the lab adults in limestone habitats where the host plant is abundant and especially in conservation areas Guam.
The GCWCS action plan for H. o. marianensis has not been implemented.
Threat Assessment and Recommendations from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Species Assessment and Listing Priority Assignment Form (Quoted verbatim from Anonymous (2012a)) Summary of Threats :
Based on our evaluation of predation and parasitism we conclude there is su⬚cient information to develop a proposed rule for this species due to the threat of predation by ants and parasitism by small wasps. The likely extirpation of this species from Saipan and its reduction to low numbers on Guam makes it vulnerable to random demographic and environmental events. We ⬚nd that this species is warranted for listing throughout all of its range, and, therefore, ⬚nd that it is unnecessary to analyze whether it is threatened or endangered in a signi⬚cant portion of its range. ...
Recommended Conservation Measures :
 Develop and implement monitoring surveys for the Mariana eight spot but-
ter⬚y
 Conduct parasite control  Conduct ant control
The USFWS recommendation for conserving H. o. marianensis by controlling parasites and ants may not produce positive results. There is currently no evidence that larvae or pupae are being parasitized and it is probable that the two known egg parasitoids are native parasitic wasps Schreiner and Nafus (1996) which have coevolved with H. o. marianensis. H. o. marianensis immatures are attacked by alien ant species, but closely related butter⬚y species on Guam are abundant despite attacks from these same ants.

Although reasons for the scarcity of H. o. marianensis are not fully understood, there seems to be a concensus among entomologists that have studied this butter⬚y that the subspecies is rare because its host plants are heavily grazed by introduced deer and pigs, which have high populations in most of Guam's limestone forest areas. There is a tight association between occurrence of H. o. marianensis and its host plants. Schreiner and Nafus (1996) reported ⬚At all locations where the host plants were found at least one of the stages of H. o. marianensis was also found.⬚ Recent surveys have shown that Eight-spot butter⬚ies are rarely observed except in close proximity to host plants.
The loss of E. calcareum and Procris pedunculata in many areas of Guam due to heavy deer and pig feeding has been linked to the rarity of the butter⬚y H. o. marianensis, which is endemic to Guam and Saipan (Wiles et al., 1999).
Browsing damage to native forests can he extensive, causing signi⬚cant changes in forest structure and species composition. The objectives of current deer management programs in the Marianas are not compatible with the conservation of native ecosystems and recovery of endangered species. Recommendations are made to reduce deer densities dramatically through intensive continuous harvest over large areas of each island and to eradicate deer from sites of signi⬚cant ecological value Wiles et al. (1999).
Host plants (Procris pedunculata and Elatostema calcareum ) for larvae of the candidate Mariana eight spot butter⬚y, Hypolimnas octocula marianensis, are found in the limestone forest of Andersen Air Force Base. Deer browse has limited occurrence of these plant species to pinnacle karst and cli⬚ edges that are inaccessible to deer.Anonymous (2012b).
Exclusion of ungulates and repopulation of limestone forest conservation areas with larval host plants may present the most promising conservation measure.
