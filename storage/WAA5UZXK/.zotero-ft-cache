Pests in Brief
A new scale insect. The Chinese mussel scale has been intercepted more than 40 times in Florida since 1992, especially on lucky bamboo (Dracaena braunii). Its hosts include several plant species present in our islands. See page 2 of this issue.
Another invasive plant. Tropical soda apple (Solanum viarum) is native to South America but is now in subtropical Asia and 11 states in the southeastern U.S. Like all successful weeds, it is fast growing and difficult to contain. For more on this “prickly” plant, see pages 3 and 4. Snail and slug pests. Many of the former American-Affiliated Pacific Islands are home to snail and slug pests. Some of you are familiar with the giantAfrican snail, rosy wolf snail, apple snail, or Cuban slug. If you are unaware of these pests or their potential impact, see our alert on pages 5 and 6.

(B) Yellowing (chlorosis) and necrosis (arrows) caused by feeding is especially noticeable along leaf edges. These scale insects will also feed heavily on stems. (C) Parts of the waxy scale cover (arrows): a) cover of the first-stage crawler, b) cover of the second stage, c) developing cover of the adult. (D) Undersides of two adult females: a) unhatched eggs, b) eggs after hatching.

(A) Florida field covered with fast-growing tropical soda apple (Solanum viarum). (B) Single plants can grow to six feet high and spread rapidly by root suckers and seeds. (C) Thorn-like prickles also grow on the leaves of soda apple (arrows). (D) A single flower and fruit hanging among stems armed with long prickles.

Origin and Distribution. Native to Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina. Introduced into Africa, India, Nepal, and areas of tropical Asia. It is reported from 11 southeastern states in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. It is most common in Florida.

Description. Perennial broadleaf shrub (in tropics), 3-6 ft (1-2 m) tall, leaves and stems with 1 in (2.5 cm) “thorns.” Leaves 2-8 in (6-20 cm) long x 2-6 in (6-15 cm) wide. Flowers white, star-shaped, single or in small group. Fruit round berries 0.8-1 in (2-3 cm) diameter,. Green fruits turn yellow as they ripen, but seed may be viable in young fruits (~0.5 in, 1 cm). The root system is extensive.

(A) Solanum viarum is in the same genus as potatoes and tomatoes and has star-shaped flowers with long orange stamens. (B) Fruits of tropical soda apple change color from green, to green and white, to yellow as they mature. (C) Greenish yellow fruits contain from 250 to 500 reddish, lens-shaped, viable seeds. (D) The extensive root system of S. viarum can produce suckers that grow into “new” plants. To eliminate this plant pest by plowing or digging, all pieces of the root system must be removed to prevent regrowth.

Impact. On the Federal Noxious Weed List. Reduces biological diversity by replacing native plants. Prickles on plants inhibit grazing and keep some animals from moving through heavy growth. As a member of the Solanaceae, S. viarum contains solasodine, a chemical that is toxic to humans.

Likely Locations. Mainly in disturbed sites: pastures, sides of ditches and excavations, orchards, among sugarcane, areas overturned by rooting of feral pigs, but also occurs in wild and wooded areas. It thrives in soils with good drainage and can briefly tolerate wet but not flooded soils. Able to grow in dry climates and seeds can germinate under moderate drought conditions.

Pohnpei, Truk, Palau, Guam, N. Mariana Is.

lau, Guam, Saipan.

Description. (A) Reddish brown conical shell banded with lighter colors, usually 2-4 in (5-10 cm) long, but can exceed 8 in (20 cm) long by 3 in (8 cm) wide.
Impact. Voracious; feeds on agricultural and garden crops and ornamentals; public nuisance; carries rat lungworm disease; can spread the fungus-like organisms that cause black pod of cacao, taro leaf blight.
Likely Locations. In most humid areas of the tropics.

Description. (B) Brownish pink elongate shells 2-3 in (5-7.5 cm) long by 0.8-1 in (2-2.8 cm) wide, but variable; (C) middle shell 1.5 in (3.7 cm) long. Impact. Ineffective control of African snail, but feeds on other snails and slugs. Endangers native snail populations, reportedly causing extinction of many species in Hawaii. Carries rat lungworm disease. Likely Locations. Gardens, roadsides, forests; will follow prey into trees, even in water for a distance.
